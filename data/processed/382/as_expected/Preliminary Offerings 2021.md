**Professional investors and ECPs Only Target Market: Solely for the purposes of the manufacturers’ product**
approval process of the manufacturers, the target market assessment in respect of the debt securities described
in the offering memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such debt securities is
eligible counterparties (“ECPs”) and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as
amended, “MiFID II”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of such debt securities to eligible counterparties
and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such
securities (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment;
however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in
respect of such debt securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment)
and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**Professional investors and ECPs Only Target Market: Solely for the purposes of the manufacturer’s product**
approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the debt securities has led to the conclusion that:
(i) the target market for the debt securities is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook
Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in Regulation
(EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018
(“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the debt securities to eligible counterparties and
professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the debt
securities (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturer’s target market assessment;
however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance
Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its own target
market assessment in respect of the debt securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturer’s target
market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors: The debt securities described in the offering memorandum are**
not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be made available to and
should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes,
a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1)
of MiFID II); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU, as amended, where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II.
Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the
“PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the debt securities described in the offering memorandum or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or
selling the debt securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful
under the PRIIPs Regulation. The offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the
securities in any Members State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus
Regulation from a requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of securities. The offering memorandum is
not a prospectus for the purpose of the Prospectus Regulation.

**Prohibition of Sales to UK Retail Investors: The debt securities are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise**
made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the
United Kingdom. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail
client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by
virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “EUWA”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of
the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive
(EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of
Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or
(iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic
law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No
1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering
or selling the debt securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared
and, therefore, offering or selling the debt securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor
in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation. The offering memorandum has been prepared
on the basis that any offer of the securities in the United Kingdom will be made pursuant to an exemption
under the under the UK Prospectus Regulation from a requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of
securities. The offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the UK Prospectus Regulation.

The offering memorandum is being distributed only to and directed only at (i) persons who are outside the
United Kingdom, (ii) persons who have professional experience in matters relating to investments and fall
within Article 19(5) of The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005, (as
amended, the “Financial Promotion Order”), (iii) persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (“high net
worth companies, unincorporated associations, etc.”) of the Financial Promotion Order, (iv) those persons to
whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the
FSMA) in connection with the issue of any securities may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to
be communicated, or (v) those persons to whom they may otherwise lawfully be distributed (all such persons

persons. Any investment or investment activity to which the offering memorandum relates is available only to
relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant persons.

No person may communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in
investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the
issue or sale of the securities other than in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply
to us.

**PRELIMINARY OFFERING MEMORANDUM** **NOT FOR GENERAL DISTRIBUTION**
**STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL** **IN THE UNITED STATES**

## UNITED GROUP B.V.
#### €300,000,000 % Senior Secured Notes due 2028


United Group B.V., a private limited liability company (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) incorporated under the laws of the
Netherlands (the “Issuer”), is offering (the “Offering”) €300 million in aggregate principal amount of its % Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the
“New Notes”). The New Notes will be issued under the indenture dated as of February 6, 2020, by and among, inter alios, the Issuer and U.S. Bank
Trustees Limited, as trustee (as amended and supplemented from time to time).
The Issuer will pay interest on the New Notes semi-annually in arrears on each and, commencing, 2022. The New Notes will
mature on, 2028. Interest on the New Notes will accrue at a rate per annum computed against the principal outstanding on the New Notes
equal to %.
Proceeds of the Offering will be used by the Issuer (i) to pay the purchase price for the Optima Telekom Acquisition (as defined herein), (ii) to repay
certain obligations outstanding under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, (iii) for general corporate purposes, which may include potential future
acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures and other purposes, and (iv) to pay transaction costs associated with the Offering. See “Use of
_Proceeds.”_
Prior to, 2024, the Issuer will be entitled, at its option, to redeem all or a portion of the New Notes by paying a “make-whole” premium, as
described in this offering memorandum. The New Notes may be redeemed at any time on or after, 2024, at the redemption prices set forth
in this offering memorandum. In addition, prior to, 2024, the Issuer may redeem at its option up to 40% of the New Notes with the net
proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price of % of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest
thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, to the applicable redemption date, provided that at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the
New Notes (not including any additional notes) remains outstanding after the redemption (unless all of the New Notes are redeemed substantially
concurrently). Prior to, 2024, the Issuer may redeem during each calendar year up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the New
Notes at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the
applicable redemption date.
In the event of certain developments affecting taxation, the Issuer may redeem all, but not less than all, of the New Notes. In addition, in connection with
certain tender offers for the New Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of such outstanding New Notes validly tender and
do not withdraw such New Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third-party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of
such New Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third-party will have the right to redeem, in whole but not in part,
such New Notes that remain outstanding, following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to other holders of such New Notes.
Upon certain events defined as constituting a change of control, the Issuer may be required to make an offer to purchase the New Notes at 101% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, to (but not including) the date of repurchase. However, a change of control will not be
deemed to have occurred if a specified consolidated net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such event.
The New Notes will be senior secured obligations of the Issuer and will, subject to the Agreed Security Principles (as defined herein) and as further
described and at the times detailed herein, be guaranteed (the “Guarantees”) on a senior secured basis by Adria Midco B.V. (the “Company”) and certain
subsidiaries of the Issuer and be secured by the Collateral (as defined herein). The validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests
in respect of the Collateral will be subject to significant limitations, as described in “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the
_Security Interests.”_
This offering memorandum includes information on the terms of the New Notes, including redemption and repurchase prices, security, covenants and
transfer restrictions. See “Description of the New Notes.”
There is currently no public market for the New Notes. Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the
“Authority”) for the listing of the New Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”) and to be admitted for trading
on the Exchange. There is no assurance, however, that the New Notes will be listed and admitted for trading on the Exchange.
**Investing in the New Notes involves a high degree of risk. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 47.**
**Issue Price of the New Notes:** **%**
**None of the New Notes or the Guarantees thereof have been, or will be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”),**
**or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. The New Notes may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S.**
**persons, except to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act (“Rule 144A”)**
**and to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act (“Regulation S”). You are hereby notified that sellers of**
**the New Notes may be relying on the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act provided by Rule 144A. The New Notes are not**
**transferable except in accordance with the restrictions described under “Plan of Distribution” and “Transfer Restrictions.”**
The New Notes will be in registered form and will initially be issued in denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof;
provided that the New Notes may only be transferred in amounts of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The New Notes will be
represented on issue by global notes (each, a “Global Note”), which we expect will be delivered through Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear”) and

described herein and should be used solely for the purposes for which it has been produced. Distribution of
this offering memorandum to any person other than the prospective investor and any person retained to
advise such prospective investor with respect to the purchase of the New Notes is unauthorized and any

prohibited. Each prospective investor, by accepting delivery of this offering memorandum, agrees to the
foregoing and agrees to not make copies of this offering memorandum or any documents referred to in this
offering memorandum.

In making an investment decision, prospective investors must rely solely on the information contained in this
offering memorandum and their own examination of the Issuer and its subsidiaries and businesses and the
terms of the offering of the New Notes, including the merits and risks involved. Neither the Issuer nor any of
the Initial Purchasers has authorized any other person to provide different information to any investor or
potential investor and the Issuer does not take responsibility for any information that others may give to you.
In addition, neither the Issuer, nor any of the Initial Purchasers, nor the Trustee, nor any of their respective
representatives, is making any representation to prospective investors regarding the legality of an investment
in the New Notes, and prospective investors should not construe anything in this offering memorandum as
legal, business or tax advice. Prospective investors should consult their own advisers as to legal, tax, business,
financial and related aspects of an investment in the New Notes. Prospective investors must comply with all
laws applicable in any jurisdiction in which they buy, offer or sell the New Notes or possess or distribute this
offering memorandum; none of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, or the Trustee, shall have any responsibility
for any of the foregoing legal requirements. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

The Issuer is offering the New Notes in reliance on an exemption from registration under the Securities Act
for an offer and sale of securities that does not involve a public offering. The New Notes are subject to
restrictions on transferability and resale and may not be transferred or resold except as permitted under the
Securities Act and applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction pursuant to registration or exemption
therefrom. Prospective purchasers should be aware that they may be required to bear the financial risks of this
investment for an indefinite period of time. If you purchase the New Notes, you will be deemed to have made
certain acknowledgments, representations and warranties as detailed under “Transfer Restrictions.”

This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer or solicitation by anyone in any jurisdiction in which
such offer or solicitation is not authorized or to any person to whom it is unlawful to make such offer or
solicitation. No action has been, or will be, taken to permit a public offering in any jurisdiction where action
would be required for that purpose. Accordingly, the New Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or
indirectly, nor may this offering memorandum be distributed, in any jurisdiction except in accordance with
the legal requirements applicable in such jurisdiction.

The Issuer reserves the right to withdraw this offering at any time. The Issuer is making this offering subject to
the terms described in this offering memorandum and the purchase agreement relating to the New Notes
entered into between the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers. The Issuer and the Initial Purchasers may reject any

The Initial Purchasers, the Issuer and certain of their related entities may acquire, for their own accounts, a
portion of the New Notes.

Interests in the New Notes will be available initially in book-entry form. The Issuer expects that the New
Notes sold will be issued in the form of one or more Global Notes. The Global Notes will be deposited with
a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream and registered in the name of its nominee. Transfers of

**NOTICE TO EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA INVESTORS**

The New Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) or the
United Kingdom. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of (i) a retail
client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”), (ii) a
customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”)
where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of
MiFID II, or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently no key
information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”)
for offering or selling the New Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or the
United Kingdom has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the New Notes or otherwise making
them available to any retail investor in the EEA or the United Kingdom may be unlawful under the PRIIPs
Regulation.

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any Member State of
the EEA or the United Kingdom that is subject to Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament
and of the Council of 14 June 2017 (as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”) will be made pursuant to an
exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the
New Notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

**NOTICE TO U.K. INVESTORS**

The New Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (the “UK”). For these purposes,
a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2
of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union
(Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “EUWA”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and
any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer
would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No
600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in
Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA.
Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the New Notes or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and, therefore, offering or
selling the New Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful
under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the New Notes in the UK will be
made pursuant to an exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue
of the EUWA (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”) from a requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of
securities. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the UK Prospectus Regulation.

Notwithstanding the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union, any references in this offering
memorandum to European Union law should be treated as references to such law as applies in England and
Wales from time to time including as retained, amended, extended, re-enacted or otherwise given effect on or
after 11:00 pm on January 31, 2020.

_MiFID II Product Governance_

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of J.P. Morgan AG (the “Manufacturer”), the target
market assessment in respect of the New Notes described in this offering memorandum has led to the
conclusion that (i) the target market for such New Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients
only, each as defined in MiFID II and (ii) all channels for distribution of such New Notes to eligible
counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or
recommending such New Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the Manufacturer’s target
market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target
market assessment in respect of such New Notes (by either adopting or refining the Manufacturer’s target
market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

offering memorandum including, without limitation, statements regarding our future financial position, risks

objectives for future operations, may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Words such as “believe,”
“expect,” “anticipate,” “may,” “assume,” “plan,” “intend,” “will,” “should,” “estimate,” “risk” and similar
expressions or the negatives of these expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. By their
nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties because they relate
to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. Forward-looking statements
are not guarantees of future performance. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements.

In addition any forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this offering memorandum and
we do not intend, and do not assume any obligation, to update forward-looking statements set forth in this
offering memorandum.

Many factors may cause our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and the development of the
industry in which we compete to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking
statements contained in this offering memorandum. Factors that could cause such differences in actual results
include:

- the high level of competition in the markets in which we operate;

- the impact of volatile economic conditions on demand for our services and our subscriber base;

- our ability to generate strong advertising sales;

- our ability to successfully complete acquisitions and the risks associated with those acquisitions;

- the possibility of competition authorities delaying or preventing acquisitions;

- acceptance of our content by the public;

- our dependence on relationships with content owners;

- our ability to keep pace with technological changes and evolving industry standards;

- our relationships with third-party providers of hardware, software, satellite services and customer support;

- our ability to maintain our reputation and the value associated with our brands;

- the possible health risks of antenna sites and the use of mobile telephones;


-----

- our ability to attract and retain key personnel;

- our ability to maintain positive business relationships with our competitors;

- our ability to renew regulatory licenses and permits;

- our ability to secure spectrum;

- current or future levels of EU regulation of the level of mobile roaming charges;

- the continued implementation of political and economic reforms in our countries of operation;

- our ability to cope with more extensive regulation;

- the impact of changes in labor laws on our business;

- our ability to comply with applicable data protection laws and policies;

- the impact of legal proceedings on our business;

- the extent to which our business operations are protected by intellectual property rights;

- our compliance with third-party intellectual property rights;

- our ability to cope with increased inflation;

- the impact of changes to tax legislation on our business; and

- other risks associated with our indebtedness, the offering of the New Notes and our structure as discussed
under “Risk Factors.”

We disclose important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations in
“Risk Factors”and “The Company’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
_of Operations.” Other sections of this offering memorandum describe additional factors that could adversely_
affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive
and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to
predict all such risk factors. We cannot assess the impact of all risk factors on our business or the extent to
which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained
in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance
on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.

_Adoption of New Accounting Policies_

We have adopted various accounting policies during the financial periods presented in this offering
memorandum. With effect as of January 1, 2019, we have adopted IFRS 16 (Leases) and IFRIC 23
(Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments). For the impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 (Leases) on our
financial statements, see Note 4 to the 2019 Company Audited Financial Statements. See “The Company’s
_Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors_
_Affecting Our Business and Results of Operations—Implementation of New Accounting Policies and Accounting_
_Updates.”_

As permitted under IFRS, we did not apply a full retrospective approach when adopting these accounting
policies and as a result have not restated any historical financial data of the Company (including comparative
figures) prior to the date disclosed above. As a result of these changes in accounting policies, our results and
financial position may not be directly comparable from period to period.

_Company Segment Reporting_

We are a pan regional distribution platform of cable and satellite Pay-TV, broadband internet and telephony
services in Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Bulgaria, Croatia, North Macedonia and
Greece. Our business has grown substantially in terms of scale, geographic reach and service
offering since 2018 through both organic growth and acquisitions. As a consequence of these changes, our
Group-level financial reporting has evolved during the last several years.

In order to provide a meaningful analysis of our results of operations during the period under review discussed
under “The Company’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations”, in addition to a discussion of our Group-level consolidated results of operations based on IFRS_
measures, we also present a discussion of revenues, UG Adjusted EBITDA and UG Adjusted Capital
Expenditure of our Serbia Group, Slovenia Group, Bosnia Group, Montenegro Group and Media Group
segments for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, and the three months ended March 31, 2020
and 2021. We also present a discussion of revenues, UG Adjusted EBITDA and UG Adjusted Capital


-----

Expenditure for the three months ended March 31, 2021 of: our Croatia Group, which we added following the
completion of the Tele2 Croatia Acquisition (as further described in this offering memorandum); our Bulgaria
Group, which we added following the completion of the Vivacom Acquisition (as further described in this
offering memorandum); and of our Greece Group, which we added following the completion of the Forthnet
Acquisition (as further described in this offering memorandum).

Under IFRS 8 “Operating Segments,” we present our segment data in the notes to the annual and interim
financial statements. In Note 5 to the Company Unaudited Interim Financial Statements, we disclose the
segment results for nine business segments, which are as follows:

- Serbia Group. This segment includes the results of cable services in Serbia and DTH operations in Serbia,
and North Macedonia, including the results of Ikom (acquired in April 2017). This segment also includes
the results of Absolut Solutions, (although these results are not reflected in the statutory consolidated
results of the SBB Serbia Group);

- Slovenia Group. This segment includes the results of our cable and mobile services and DTH operations in
Slovenia;

- Bosnia Group. This segment includes the results of our cable and DTH operations in Bosnia and
Herzegovina;

- Montenegro Group. This segment includes the results of our cable and DTH business in Montenegro;

- Bulgaria Group. This segment includes the results of our telecommunications operations in Bulgaria;

- Croatia Group. This segment includes the results of our mobile services in Croatia;

- Greece Group. This segment includes the results of Forthnet’s telecommunications and media operations in
Greece;

- Media Group. This segment includes the results of our media and content business in Southeastern Europe
including the results of N1 Info, Grand Production, Orlando Kids, Nova TV, Nova M and Nova BH as
well as United Media S.à r.l., United Media Network AG, Direct Media, Nova BG and Dan Graf; and

- Other segments. This includes our other operating business, Solford Trading Ltd. (which operates NetTV
Plus) and Shoppster, and our non-operating holding companies (United Group B.V., Adria Cable B.V.,
Adria Serbia Holdco B.V. and Slovenia Broadband S.à r.l.). Revenue reported under “Other” is mainly
generated by Solford Trading Ltd. which operates Shoppster.

Our Media Group segment presents results for Nova BG (acquired on January 22, 2021) and Dan Graf
(acquired on March 10, 2021) from the respective date of consolidation with the Group’s results for the
three months ended March 31, 2021.

While we adopted IFRS 16 with effect from January 1, 2019 at the consolidated Group level, we did not give
effect to IFRS 16 in our management accounts and therefore at the segment level until January 1, 2021. In this
offering memorandum we have adjusted the figures for the year ended December 31, 2020 to reflect this
change in accounting policy at the segment level to enhance comparability. As a result, our UG Adjusted
EBITDA, UG Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Adjusted Capital Expenditure for our Serbia Group, Slovenia
Group, Bosnia Group, Montenegro Group and Media Group for the years ended December 31, 2018 and
2019 are not comparable with amounts for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the three months ended
March 31, 2021.

_Capital Expenditure and UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure_

Capital expenditure represents purchases of tangible and intangible assets, consisting primarily of set-top box
purchases and other customer capital expenditure, installations (including capitalized labor costs), cable and
mobile network build out, upgrades, maintenance and other investments, computer hardware and software.

In this offering memorandum, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, we have derived capital
expenditure (as recognized under IFRS) for the Company and for each of the Company’s business segments
from the Company Audited Financial Statements and, for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2021,
from the Company Unaudited Interim Financial Statements. See “Reconciliation of Certain Financial Data
_Presented Herein.”_

UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure represents capital expenditure, as adjusted by intragroup adjustments, the
application of IFRS 15 for acquisition costs in SBB Serbia, assets held for sale and overflow between periods.


-----

Intragroup adjustments relate to unrealized profit on the intragroup sale of end-user equipment by SBB
Serbia. When SBB Serbia sells this equipment to other Group companies in compliance with applicable
transfer pricing requirements, it makes an unrealized profit on the sale. These unrealized profits are eliminated
for the purposes of preparing our accounts in accordance with IFRS, but are not eliminated for the purpose
of our management accounts (which are not prepared in accordance with IFRS).

The application of IFRS 15 for acquisition costs in SBB Serbia reflects the additional effect of harmonizing
our accounting policy with respect to the capitalization of subscriber acquisition costs for rebinding, upselling
and cross-selling (which in the past were not eligible to be capitalized, but under IFRS 15 qualify for
capitalization), which were determined subsequent to the preparation of our management accounts.

Assets held for sale relate to programming rights acquired by our Media Group segment for other Group
segments which were recognized under IFRS as intangible assets and were invoiced to other Group segments
after March 31, 2021.

Overflow between periods relates to the fact that our management accounts are closed prior to the closing of
our accounts prepared in accordance with IFRS. Overflow between periods in any given period reflects the
additional capital expenditure incurred between the preparation of our management accounts and our
accounts prepared in accordance with IFRS for such period.

In this offering memorandum, we present UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure for the Company and for each of
the Company’s business segments for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, and for the
three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2021. See “Summary of Company and Group Run-Rate, Vivacom,
_Unaudited Pro Forma and Certain Other Financial Data” and “Reconciliation of Certain Financial Data_
_Presented Herein.” A reconciliation between the Company’s capital expenditure and UG Adjusted Capital_
Expenditure for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, and the three months ended March 31,
2021 is included elsewhere in this offering memorandum, under “Reconciliation of Certain Financial Data
_Presented Herein.” In addition, for informational purposes only, we describe our anticipated UG Adjusted_
Capital Expenditure for the year ended December 31, 2021 based on management estimates, which may vary
from our actual Group level capital expenditure data when it is prepared in accordance with IFRS.

UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure and our future UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure estimates are prepared
based on management accounts rather than IFRS. One example of a difference in methodology used in
preparing the management account financial data (as compared to IFRS financial data) is that when
determining capital expenditure relating to set-top boxes purchased by our group companies, the expenditure
is treated as inventory until such set-top box is activated by the end-user, at which time it is treated as a fixed
asset. Under IFRS, however, this expenditure is required to be accounted for as a fixed asset from the moment
such set-top box is purchased. As a result, when presenting our segment level UG Adjusted Capital
Expenditure and our anticipated UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure for the year ended December 31, 2021 in
this offering memorandum, we classify our expenditures relating to set-top boxes as inventory until such
set-top boxes are activated by the end-user.

PricewaterhouseCoopers d.o.o. Zagreb has not audited, reviewed or performed any procedures with respect
to UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure included in this offering memorandum, and, accordingly,
PricewaterhouseCoopers d.o.o. Zagreb does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on such
information. PricewaterhouseCoopers d.o.o. assumes no responsibility for and denies any association with or
responsibility for the Company’s calculation of UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure.

_Foreign Exchange Rates_

SBB Serbia, Telemach BH, Telemach Croatia and Vivacom and Nova BG historically have reported their
results in Serbian dinar, Bosnian marks, Croatian kune and Bulgarian lev, respectively. Where we have

the average rate during that period; RSD 117.5677 per €1.00 for the three months ended March 31, 2020,
which was the average rate during that period; and RSD 117.5782 per €1.00 for the three months ended
March 31, 2021, which was the average rate during that period.

which was the average rate during that period; and HRK 7.56724 per €1.00 for the three months ended
March 31, 2021, which was the average rate during that period.

**_Vivacom Historical Financial Data_**

We have included in this offering memorandum:

(i) consolidated financial data of BTC (as defined under “Certain Definitions”) as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2020, derived from its audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes
there to as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020, which were prepared in accordance with IFRS
(as defined herein) and are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum (the “2020 Vivacom Audited
Financial Statements”),

(ii) consolidated financial data of BTC as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, and the comparative
information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, derived from its audited consolidated
financial statements and the related notes there to as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, which
were prepared in accordance with IFRS (as defined herein) and are included elsewhere in this offering
memorandum (the “2019 Vivacom Audited Financial Statements” and together with the 2020 Vivacom
Audited Financial Statements, the “Vivacom Audited Financial Statements”), and

(iii) condensed consolidated interim financial data of BTC for the nine months ended September 30, 2020,
derived from its unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements and the related notes
thereto as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, which were prepared in
accordance with “IAS 34”, as adopted by the EU, and are included elsewhere in this offering
memorandum (the “Vivacom Unaudited Interim Financial Statements”).

Certain financial information of BTC as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 included in this offering
memorandum is derived from the unaudited comparative financial information included in the 2020 Vivacom
Audited Financial Statements and is presented to reflect restated amounts resulting from the change in the
accounting policy related to leases of software, which was implemented in order to align to the treatment and
presentation under the accounting policies of Summer Parent S.à r.l. As a result, leased software is presented
as “Intangible assets” according to IAS 38—Intangible assets and not as “Right-of-use assets”, by applying
IFRS 16—Leases. The corresponding liabilities were reclassified accordingly from “Borrowings and lease
liabilities” to “Trade payables”. See Note 2.1.1 to the 2020 Vivacom Audited Financial Statements. The
financial information of BTC as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 included in this offering
memorandum was not restated to reflect this change in accounting policy given IFRS 16 was adopted as of
January 1, 2019 under the modified retrospective approach, and therefore it may not be comparable with the
financial information of BTC as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 included in this
offering memorandum.

The financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 included in this offering
memorandum is derived from the unaudited comparative financial information included in the 2019 Vivacom
Audited Financial Statements as of and is presented to reflect the (i) restated amounts of net cash from
operating activities and net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018, which have
been restated due to reclassification of 2018 capitalized costs to fulfil and obtain contracts with customers
from operating activities, to properly reflect the investing nature of those costs, in the amount of BGN
32.8 million, (ii) restated amounts of capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2018, which have


-----

been restated to be presented on a consistent basis with the calculation performed for the year ended
December 31, 2019 and the nine months ended September 30, 2020, and (iii) restated amounts in the statement
of comprehensive income due to a reclassification of other operating expenses, with effect from January 1,
2019, the amount of recognized losses for impairment of financial and contract assets is included under the
separate line item “Net impairment losses on financial and contract assets.”

Additionally, Vivacom has considered the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic as non-adjusting subsequent
events and therefore the 2019 Vivacom Audited Financial Statements do not reflect the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic. See Note 4 to the 2020 Vivacom Audited Financial Statements.

_Adoption of New Accounting Policies_

Vivacom has adopted various accounting policies during the financial periods presented in this offering
memorandum. With effect as of January 1, 2019, Vivacom has adopted IFRS 16 (Leases).

As permitted under IFRS, Vivacom did not apply a full retrospective approach when adopting these
accounting policies and, as a result, has not restated any historical financial data (including the relevant
comparative figures) prior to the implementation of the new accounting policies as of the date mentioned
above. As a result of these changes in accounting policies, Vivacom’s results and financial position may not be
directly comparable from period to period.

_Vivacom Segment Reporting_

We also present a discussion of BTC’s revenues, cost of sales and gross margin for its operating segments for
the years ended December 31, 2018 (which were derived from the comparative financial information included
in the 2019 Vivacom Audited Financial Statements ), 2019 and 2020.

Under IFRS 8 “Operating Segments,”BTC presents its segment data in the notes to the 2020 Vivacom Audited
Financial Statements and the Vivacom Unaudited Interim Financial Statements. In Note 26 to the Vivacom
Audited Financial Statements and Note 25 to the Vivacom Unaudited Interim Financial Statements, BTC
reports operating segment results for three operating segments:

- Fixed-line of business: this segment includes the results of voice and data services over the fixed network
and Pay-TV (both DTH and IPTV);

- Mobile line of business: this operating segment includes the results from mobile services (GSM, UMTS and
LTE standards); and

- NURTS business: this operating segment includes the results from TV and radio broadcasting, collocation
services and maintenance of telecom infrastructure arising from BTC’s subsidiary NURTS Bulgaria EAD
and its wholly-owned subsidiary NURTS Digital EAD.

**Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information**

We present in this offering memorandum unaudited pro forma financial information (the “Unaudited Pro
Forma Financial Information”), which includes the unaudited pro forma income statement of the Company
for the year ended December 31, 2020.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information is based on and derived from, and should be read in
conjunction with, the Company Audited Financial Statements, the Company Unaudited Interim Financial
Statements and the Vivacom Unaudited Interim Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering
memorandum.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information gives effect to the (i) Vivacom Acquisition (which completed
on August 3, 2020) and (ii) issuance of the Existing 2026 FRNs, Existing 2026 SSNs and Existing 2028 SSNs
(the “2020 Notes Financing”), which were partially used to finance the Vivacom Acquisition and, partially, to
refinance certain debt facilities existing at the issue date of the Existing 2026 SSNs, Existing 2026 FRNs and
Existing 2028 SSNs (the “2020 Notes Issue Date”) (collectively, the “Vivacom Transactions”), as if they had
been completed on January 1, 2020.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information is based on available information and certain assumptions
that we believe are reasonable. The assumptions and estimates underlying the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial
Information are described in the accompanying notes thereto. The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial
Information is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to represent or be indicative of the
financial results of operations that we would have reported had the Vivacom Transactions actually occurred


-----

during the period presented, and the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information does not purport to project
our results of operations for any future period. Neither the assumptions underlying the pro forma
adjustments, nor the resulting Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information have been audited or reviewed in
accordance with any generally accepted auditing standards.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information has not been prepared in accordance with Article 11 of
Regulation S-X under the Securities Act, the EU Prospectus Regulation or any generally accepted accounting
standards. The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information has been prepared in accordance with the basis
of preparation described below in the footnotes thereto.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information is presented in thousands of euros unless otherwise
indicated. Vivacom historical financial information is presented in thousands of Bulgarian lev. For the
purposes of the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information, financial information reported in Bulgarian
lev has been translated to euros on the basis stated in relevant footnotes to the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial
Information.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information includes unaudited pro forma adjustments that are factually
supportable and directly attributable to the Vivacom Transactions.

In addition to the Vivacom Acquisition, the Company also: (i) acquired Tele2 d.o.o. za telekomunikacijske
usluge (now trading as Telemach Hrvatska d.o.o.) and has consolidated its results from March 2020; (ii) the
Company obtained control over Forthnet on November 12, 2020 (for more information, please refer to Note
23 in the Company Audited Financial Statements); (iii) acquired Nova Broadcasting Group and has
consolidated its results from January 22, 2021; and (iv) has completed certain other acquisitions in 2021, as
described elsewhere in this offering memorandum. The Company Unaudited Pro Forma Financial
Information does not include adjustments with respect to the acquisitions referred to above.

Prospective investors should read the information presented below in conjunction with “Presentation of
_Financial Data,” “Capitalization,” “The Company’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial_
_Condition and Results of Operations,” “Vivacom’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial_
_Condition and Results of Operations,” the Company Audited Financial Statements (and the related notes_
thereto), the Company Unaudited Interim Financial Statements (and the related notes thereto), the Vivacom
Audited Financial Statements (and the related notes thereto) and the Vivacom Unaudited Interim Financial
Statements (and the related notes thereto), included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**Group Data on a Run-Rate Basis**

We also present in this offering memorandum certain financial data of the Group on a run-rate basis, which
adjusts certain financial data derived from the Company Audited Financial Statements and the Company
Unaudited Interim Financial Statements with (a) the results of Forthnet for the period from October 1, 2020
to November 11, 2020, sourced from its Forthnet’s unaudited management accounts, which has been adjusted
for savings in transponder costs already agreed with the supplier and which has been further adjusted to
reflect the application of our accounting policies and satellite savings, (b) the results of Nova BG for the
period from October 1, 2020 to January 21, 2021, sourced from its unaudited management accounts and
which has been aligned in certain aspects to our Group accounting policies, and estimates of additional
carriage fees, (c) the last two quarters adjusted EBITDA not yet consolidated into the Group's results for the
contribution of the following companies acquired during the period: Dan Graf, Vesnik Telegraf, Net1, N3, D
express, Mainstream and Networx, and (d) the last two quarters adjusted EBITDA not yet consolidated into
the Group's results for the contribution of Optima Telekom, sourced from its unaudited management
accounts.

The Group data on a run-rate basis presented in this offering memorandum is based on a number of
assumptions made in reliance on the information available to us and management’s judgments based on such
information. The assumptions used in estimating the adjustments are inherently uncertain and are subject to
a wide variety of significant business, economic, and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause
actual results to differ materially from those presented in this offering memorandum. See “Summary of
_Company and Group Run-Rate, Vivacom, Unaudited Pro Forma and Certain Other Financial Data.”_

The Group data on a run-rate basis included in this offering memorandum has been prepared by the
Company’s management. The Group data on a run-rate basis is not intended to and does not represent
historical or future performance for any period. Such information is the sole responsibility of the Company’s
management. PricewaterhouseCoopers d.o.o. Zagreb has not audited, reviewed, examined or compiled, or
has applied agreed upon procedures with respect to the Group data on a run-rate basis and, accordingly,


-----

PricewaterhouseCoopers d.o.o. Zagreb does not provide any form of assurance with respect thereto for the
purpose of this offering memorandum.

**Non-IFRS Financial and Operating Data**

Certain financial measures of United Group and ratios related thereto in this offering memorandum,
including:

- UG EBITDA,

- UG Adjusted EBITDA,

- UG Adjusted EBITDA Margin,

- UG Adjusted EBITDA minus UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure,

- UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure, and

- UG Last Two Quarter Adjusted EBITDA on a pre-IFRS 16 basis;

certain financial measures of Vivacom and ratios related thereto in this offering memorandum, including:

- Vivacom EBITDA,

- Vivacom Adjusted EBITDA,

- Vivacom Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and

- Vivacom Operating Free Cash Flow;

certain pro forma financial measures of the Group and ratios related thereto in this offering memorandum,
including:

- Pro Forma Revenue,

- Pro Forma Adjusted Capital Expenditure,

- Pro Forma EBITDA,

- Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, and

- Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin; and

certain run-rate financial measures of the Group and ratios related thereto in this offering memorandum,
including:

- Run-Rate Revenue,

- Run-Rate Adjusted Capital Expenditure on a pre-IFRS 16 basis,

- Run-Rate Annual Adjusted Debt Cash Interest Expense,

- Run-Rate Last Two Quarter Adjusted EBITDA on a pre-IFRS 16 basis,

- Run-rate Last Two Quarter Annualized Adjusted EBITDA on a pre-IFRS 16 basis,

- Run-Rate Last Two Quarter Annualized Adjusted EBITDA on a pre-IFRS 16 basis Margin,

Adjusted Capital Expenditure on a pre-IFRS 16 basis,

- Ratio of Adjusted Net Debt to Run-Rate Last Two Quarter Annualized Adjusted EBITDA on a pre-IFRS
16 basis, and

- Ratio of Run-Rate Last Two Quarter Annualized Adjusted EBITDA on a pre-IFRS 16 basis to Run-Rate
Annual Adjusted Debt Cash Interest Expense.

together with compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) are collectively referred to as the “Non-IFRS
Measures.”The Non-IFRS Measures are not specifically defined under IFRS or any other generally accepted
accounting principles. These measures are presented in this offering memorandum because we believe that
they and similar measures are widely used in the telecommunications industry as a means of evaluating a
company’s operating performance and financing structure. These measures may not be comparable to other
similarly titled measures of other companies and are not measurements under IFRS or other generally
accepted accounting principles, and you should not consider such items as alternatives to net income (loss),


-----

operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS, and they may be
different from similarly titled measures used by other companies. Our management believe the data for each
respective company or group, along with comparable IFRS measures, is useful to investors because it provides
a basis for measuring the operating performance in the periods presented. These measures are used in the
internal management of our business, along with the most directly comparable IFRS financial measures, in
evaluating operating performance.

The Non-IFRS Measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation
or as a substitute for our or a relevant group’s results or any performance measures under IFRS as set forth in
our consolidated financial statements or the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements. Some of these
limitations are:

- they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital commitments;

- they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

- they do not reflect the interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal
payments on our debt;

- they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay;

- they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our consolidated profit
and loss statement;

- they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not to be
indicative of our ongoing operations;

- assets are depreciated or amortized over differing estimated useful lives and often have to be replaced in the
future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and

- other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their
usefulness as comparative measures.

Because of these limitations the Non-IFRS Measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary
cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us
to meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our IFRS results
and using these Non-IFRS Measures only supplementally to evaluate our performance. Please see “Summary
_of Company and Group Run-Rate, Vivacom, Unaudited Pro Forma and Certain Other Financial Data,”_
“Selected Company Historical Financial Data,” “The Company’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, “Vivacom’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial_
_Condition and Results of Operations”, and the Company Audited Financial Statements (including the related_
notes), the Company Unaudited Interim Financial Statements (including the related notes), the Vivacom
Audited Financial Statements (including the related notes) and the Vivacom Unaudited Interim Financial
Statements (including the related notes) included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

For a description of how our Non-IFRS Measures are calculated from our consolidated results from
operations and a reconciliation of our Non-IFRS Measures to our results for the periods presented in this
offering memorandum, please see “Summary of Company and Group Run-Rate, Vivacom, Unaudited Pro
_Forma and Certain Other Financial Data.”_

**Overview**

We are the leading cable and media player in Southeastern Europe, providing services to approximately
3.7 million homes as of March 31, 2021. We are the leading distributor of Pay-TV in our core markets of
Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and the number two distributor in Montenegro. As of March 31,
2021, we provided services to approximately 10.9 million RGUs and analog and digital cable Pay-TV services
to approximately 1.9 million unique subscribers. United Group’s revenue for the three months ended
March 31, 2021 was €439.4 million and UG Adjusted EBITDA was €179.2 million. The Group had Run-Rate
Revenue for the annualized last two quarters ended March 31, 2021 of €1,976.4 million and Run-Rate Last
Two Quarter Annualized Adjusted EBITDA on a pre-IFRS 16 basis for March 31, 2021 was €706.3 million.

The Combined Group is the clear multi-play leader in its footprint, with market leading positions in Pay-TV,
broadband internet and fixed-line and mobile-telephony in Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Montenegro, North Macedonia, Bulgaria, Croatia and, following the Forthnet Acquisition, Greece. The
Combined Group’s addressable market comprised 13.4 million households as of December 31, 2020.

We have grown rapidly through both acquisitions and organic growth. In July 2020, we acquired Vivacom, the
market leading integrated telecommunications operator in Bulgaria, based on total revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2020, which is the leading operator in fixed-line telephony services and broadband services, the
number three provider of mobile-telephony services and the number three provider of Pay-TV, in each case,
by number of subscribers as of March 31, 2021. The Vivacom Acquisition increased our addressable market
by approximately 35% in terms of population, and the addition of Vivacom’s subscriber base more than
doubled our existing subscriber base. In March 2020, we also acquired Tele2 Croatia, the third largest
telecommunications operator in Croatia, based on mobile revenues as of March 31, 2021, through which we
offer mobile services in Croatia. In November 2020, we completed the acquisition of a controlling interest
(the “Forthnet Acquisition”) in Forthnet S.A. (“Forthnet”), a prominent telecom operator and Pay-TV
provider in Greece, which marked our entry into the Greek market and will strengthen our position as an
industry leader in Southeastern Europe. In January 2021, we acquired Bulgaria’s largest multi-platform media
company, Nova Broadcasting Group EOOD, from Advance Media Group EAD (the “Nova Broadcasting
Group Acquisition”), providing a strong base for our content offering in Bulgaria. In July 2021, we signed an
agreement to acquire a majority interest (the “Optima Telekom Acquisition”) in OT-Optima Telekom d.d.
(“Optima Telekom”), a Croatian telecom operator offering a broad range of fixed internet and pay-TV
services. Subject to its completion, the Optima Telekom Acquisition will allow us to further expand our
presence in the Croatian market and offer a full range of telecommunication services, including pay-TV,
through our existing infrastructure in the country.

We offer a diverse and differentiated line of products and services. We are the leading distributor of satellite
(“DTH”) Pay-TV across Southeastern Europe, with Pay-TV product and service offerings in each of Slovenia,
Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia and Montenegro, where we use our Total TV platform to
serve subscribers both inside and outside of our cable footprint to deliver content across the entire region,
including rural areas. Following the Vivacom Acquisition, we also provide Pay-TV services in Bulgaria and
are the leading IPTV provider in Bulgaria, while the Nova Broadcasting Group Acquisition strengthened our
content offering in Bulgaria. Following the Forthnet Acquisition, we also provide cable and DTH services in
Greece. In addition to our cable-based and satellite-based services, we offer mobile-telephony services in
Slovenia, Bulgaria and Croatia. We provide 4G LTE coverage to almost the entire population in each of these
countries, and we are rolling out 5G networks across our mobile-telephony footprint. On September 21, 2020,
we announced the commercial launch of our 5G network in Bulgaria, and to that end in May 2021, we
secured a 20-year license for 100 MHz spectrum frequencies in the 3.6 GHz band. We also in April 2021
secured 15-year spectrum licenses in Slovenia for 5G frequencies, and commenced deployment and
commercial launch of 5G 3600 MHz in Slovenia in June 2021. We are participating in a 5G spectrum auction
in Croatia this year.


-----

Our core telecommunications business is also complemented by our two over-the-top (“OTT”) distribution
platforms that customers can access through internet based streaming: EON, our regional OTT platform,
which enables customers connected to our competitors’ broadband internet connections outside of our cable
footprint to access our attractive portfolio of Pay-TV channels, and NetTV Plus, our international OTT
platform, which delivers ethnic and local language content to the ex-Yugoslav diaspora around the world. In
July 2020, we launched Shoppster, our regional e-commerce online-shopping platform, which offers more
than 20 popular product categories, including electronics, home and gardening, tools, fashion, items for
children and kitchen appliances. Shoppster is available as an integrated online and TV shopping platform in
Serbia and Slovenia.

Through our in-house content business, we produce distinctive and attractive in-house media content for our
Pay-TV channels across multiple key genres that have historically driven Pay-TV subscriptions. These channels
include Southeastern Europe’s most popular family of branded Pay-TV sports channels, as well as popular
movie channels, children’s channels, a 24/7 news channel, music channels and other specialized channels,
which we continue to expand both organically and through acquisitions. We currently produce over 40% of
the total content in our national (terrestrial) and cable operations, and our programs typically receive ratings
of between 30% to 60% in the markets in which they are available. The Group also has in-house media and
content production in Greece. We believe that our market leading content portfolio differentiates us from our
competitors, has enabled strong growth in our business and provides us with predictable third-party carriage
fees.

As part of our media business, we also provide advertising services and digital production and distribution.
Our Nova TV Croatia channel has strong local content production and profitability, with an audience share
of 40% and market share by advertising revenue of 50%. Nova BH and Nova M have appealing content, such
as popular national team football events until 2022, such as the Euro Cup qualifiers, Euro Cup, World Cup
qualifiers and League of Nations. In March 2019, we launched Nova S in Serbia. Nova S is a channel offering
high-quality local production series, sports, talk shows with well-known national presenters and high-quality
international productions, fully exclusive to SBB, Total TV and EON. The Nova Broadcasting Group
Acquisition makes us a major content player in Bulgaria by adding Nova BG’s media platform comprising
ten television channels, including NOVA TV, which broadcasts throughout Bulgaria, Bulgaria’s largest online
platform, Net Info, which reaches on average 80% of the Bulgarian population each month, and four radio
stations.

In addition to our own content, as a result of our pan regional presence and well established distribution
network, we are a distribution partner of choice for premium regional and international content owners, such
as Discovery/Eurosport, Viacom, AXN, CNN, HBO, Fox and Universal, and sports rights owners, such as
the English Premier League, Spanish Football League LaLiga, 2020 UEFA European Championship
qualifiers, 2020 UEFA European Championship, 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, UEFA League of Nations,
ATP, Formula 1, Euroleague, and Moto GP, which we believe allows us to consistently obtain high-quality
content and attractive payment terms. Nova BG holds licenses to offer compelling content in Bulgaria through
distributors such as CBS Intenrational, the Walt Disney Company, Columbia Pictures and Paramount
Pictures, as well as popular sports content such as the English Premier League football, Euro Cup qualifiers
and the Euro Cup and Formula One racing. We believe these providers partner with us because of our
well-known brands, large network and our focus on Southeastern Europe.

We operate most of our business across eight countries in Southeastern Europe: Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and
Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Greece. These countries have a
combined population of approximately 40 million, distributed across approximately 13.4 million households
as of December 31, 2020, and represent the second-largest Central and Eastern European (“CEE”) market
after Poland. Despite economic differences, many of these countries share a joint history and form a single
market in which small local differences are overshadowed by the influence of similarities in cultural preferences
and language across the region and are characterized by growing Pay-TV and broadband markets that are
currently underpenetrated relative to some other CEE and Western European markets.

We are the leading multi-play provider in Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Bulgaria, where we
combine our services into packages, or bundles, which offer subscribers the convenience of being able to
purchase television, broadband internet and telephony services from a single provider, and provides us with
significant opportunities to cross-sell our products.

We believe that we are well-positioned to maintain our market leading positions in the Pay-TV and cable
broadband internet markets in Slovenia, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to further increase our
market shares, as we differentiate our product offerings through one of the highest download speeds in our


-----

broadband markets, access to desirable media content, a well invested network and high-quality customer
service, which has led to relatively low churn rates which we believe demonstrate customer loyalty. We also
believe that we are well-positioned to continue to grow in our region, and build on our expansion into Bulgaria
and Greece. Our customers view the telecommunications products and services that we offer as part of their
everyday lives, which results in recurring, high demand for our products and makes our business more resilient
to macro-economic disruptions when compared to other discretionary products and services. For example,
during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic our products and services have been instrumental in providing
connectivity and entertainment, as an increasing number of people began to work or study remotely and
spent significant amounts of time at home, which resulted in a significant increase in our voice and data
traffic between March and May 2020. In particular, over this period, our fixed data traffic increased at rates
between 50% and 70%, while fixed voice traffic increased at rates between 50% and 85%, depending on the
country. In addition, our mobile data and voice traffic increased at rates between 30% and 40%, depending on
the country. Traffic levels decreased during the summer months and started increasing again as new lockdowns
were implemented in various countries. To accommodate such higher customer demand, we increased capacity
on network elements and interconnections. In this recurring, high demand environment, we believe we offer
superior products, faster broadband speeds and higher quality content than many of our competitors.

**Competitive Strengths**

We believe a number of key factors give us a competitive advantage, including:

**_We are the leading multi-play service provider with a pan regional platform across Southeastern Europe._**

We are the leading multi-play telecommunications and media provider in Southeastern Europe, a position
which we have strengthened significantly through the Vivacom Acquisition. Specifically, we are the leading
provider of Pay-TV in our three core markets of Slovenia, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the
leading provider of broadband in Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, in each case, based on market share
by number of subscribers. We are also the leading provider of broadband and the number three provider of
Pay-TV in Bulgaria based on market share by number of subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2020,
and the second-largest Pay-TV operator in Greece. In addition to our cable-based and satellite-based services,
we offer mobile-telephony services in Slovenia, in Bulgaria and in Croatia. The acquisitions we have made
have delivered significant geographic expansion and diversification of our business into Bulgaria and Greece.
The Vivacom Acquisition, for example, increased our addressable market by 35% in terms of population, and
doubled our existing customer base. Furthermore, our scale and presence across Southeastern Europe and
across our product portfolios allows us to cross-sell our services and expand the number of multi-play
packages we provide, creating opportunities to expand our customer base.

The table below shows key operating and financial data of the Group as of and for the three months ended
March 31, 2021, except where otherwise noted.

DTH services and Pink International (which distributes Pink channels in Western Europe) and DTH North Macedonia.

(5) Based on aggregated revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2021, United Group’s Media Group’s external revenue
represented 14% of our total aggregated revenue for the same period; figures for Nova BG for the period prior to its acquisition by
us are based on management accounts.

(6) This figure includes 1.8 million homes passed through Vivacom’s FTTP / VDSL network. Forthnet uses OTE’s wholesale Local
Loop Unbundling (LLU) and Bitstream services for its fixed network access across Greece.

(7) Most Cable RGUs for Forthnet represent broadband and fixed-telephony. Customers of Forthnet are serviced through a local loop
unbundling arrangement with the incumbent OTE.

We are the pan regional leader for Pay-TV services with 2.6 million unique Pay-TV subscribers as of March 31,
2021, and we have leveraged our complementary cable and DTH platforms to gain a leading Pay-TV market
share of 46% in Serbia, as of March 31, 2021, 39% in Slovenia as of December 31, 2020, and 41% in Bosnia
and Herzegovina, as of December 31, 2020, 26% in Bulgaria, as of December 31, 2020, and 28% in Greece, as
of December 31, 2020, each based on number of subscribers. In addition, we are the largest DTH Pay-TV
provider in Montenegro and are among the main providers of DTH Pay-TV in North Macedonia and Croatia.

We are the leading high-speed cable broadband internet provider in each of Slovenia, Serbia and Bosnia and
Herzegovina within our footprint in each country and have a large broadband market share overall, behind
only the respective incumbents with national footprints. In Bulgaria, we are the market leader in broadband
by number of subscribers, with a market share of 33% as of December 31, 2020.

We leveraged our Pay-TV and cable broadband internet capabilities to become the second-largest fixed-line
telephony provider in Slovenia, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Following the liberalization of the
telephony markets in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia, which allowed customers to retain their existing
telephone number when switching to our network in 2014, we have substantially grown our fixed-line
telephony subscriber numbers. In addition, in Bulgaria, we are the market leader in fixed-line telephony, with
a 66% market share by number of subscribers as of September 30, 2020.

In mobile-telephony, we are the third largest mobile network operator (“MNO”) in Slovenia, with a market
share of 24% as of March 31, 2021. We are also the third largest MNO in both Bulgaria, with a market share

by number of subscribers of 30%, and Croatia, with a market share of 19%, in each case, as of March 31,
2021. Between 2017 and 2019, Vivacom’s mobile revenue grew at a CAGR of 4%, demonstrating Vivacom’s
strong momentum in the mobile market. In July 2020, we leveraged our position in both the broadband and
Pay-TV markets to launch Shoppster, our regional e-commerce online-shopping platform, which offers more
than 20 popular product categories, including electronics, home and gardening, tools, fashion, items for
children and kitchen appliances. Shoppster is available as an integrated online and TV shopping platform in
Serbia and Slovenia. In Serbia, Shoppster operates as a marketplace using the dropshipping operating model,
whereby it does not stock the products it sells. In Slovenia, Shoppster operates as a retailer as a result of an
acquisition that we have completed and stores the products it sells in a leased warehouse. Products sold though
Shoppster are distributed by third-party delivery couriers in both Serbia and Slovenia. Shoppster is a unique
offering which combines the convenience of online-shopping with the audience engagement of television.
Products are presented and available for sale on the Shoppster TV channel, which is devoted to homeshopping. Popular TV personalities from Southeastern Europe present offers and products from the many
companies that have joined Shoppster. We intend for Shoppster to deliver the simple, reliable and secure
e-shopping experience that modern consumers expect.

**_We benefit from diversified revenue streams within our markets and an improved currency mix._**

Due to our leading market positions in Slovenia, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and our position as a
pan regional services provider, our business benefits from geographically diversified and product portfolio
diversified revenue streams, which we have further diversified following the Vivacom Acquisition and Forthnet
Acquisition. In terms of geographic diversity, the table below presents the percentage of revenue derived by
jurisdiction (as a percentage of gross revenue, excluding intercompany revenue) for the three months ended
March 31, 2021, after giving effect to the Vivacom Acquisition, the Tele2 Croatia Acquisition, the Forthnet
Acquisition, the Nova Broadcasting Group Acquisition and other acquisitions:

We also benefit from a currency mix that sees 85% of our gross revenues generated in euros or in geographies
where the currency is pegged to the euro in the three months ended March 31, 2021, which is a significant
increase compared to a currency mix of 65% of our gross revenues generated in euros or in geographies where
the currency is pegged to the euro in the three months ended March 31, 2020.

**_We are a recognized media leader benefitting from content ownership, own production and strategic partnerships_**
**_with international and regional broadcasters providing a differentiated Pay-TV offering._**

We believe that we are the recognized media leader in Southeastern Europe, offering fully integrated
production and distribution of attractive and distinctive local content that caters to the whole family. As of
March 31, 2021, we produced 45% of our content locally. Our content seeks to address the entire Southeastern
European region, which has a large population with similar languages, cultures and entertainment preferences
and which we believe forms a single media market. The Vivacom Acquisition and Forthnet Acquisition added
an additional seventeen million people in the region to our addressable market. Our focus on the entire
Southeastern European region allows us to maintain and serve some of the smaller markets where providers
with a smaller scale in comparison to us are less able to provide first rate localized content on an economically
efficient basis. We believe international players would find it difficult and costly to expand into the region, due
to language and cultural barriers. Furthermore, our pan regional operations make it possible for us to enter
into contracts on attractive terms with major sporting leagues and other third-party contract providers to
distribute their content to the entire region with a population, including Bulgaria, of approximately 40 million,

whereas competitors operating in a single country within the region cannot offer similarly broad coverage. We
are also able to offer our content partners value added services such as providing subtitles for television shows
and can spread the costs across our operations in the entire region, whereas we believe such costs would not be
economically justifiable for a competitor operating within a single country in the region.

Media activities at United Media fall into four categories: channel production, distribution, advertising and
digital. We believe that several factors make us an attractive partner to third-party content owners: our pan
regional presence, large subscriber base, advanced network, cable and DTH platforms and leading market
positions. We also offer attractive advertising services with desirable advertising slots, which we sell to both
local advertisers and high-profile clients from around the world. We work with advertisers to tailor
advertisements to their target audiences, and we have begun to generate revenue from the sale of advertising
across our platforms, particularly in our television stations and on our broadcast and cable networks. We have
also established a digital music production and content distribution business. Following the Nova TV Croatia
Acquisition and Direct Media/Pink Acquisition, we significantly developed our media business by adding
leading full format TV stations in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro. Nova TV Croatia has
strong local content production and profitability, with an audience share of 40% and market share by
advertising revenue of 50% as of December 31, 2020. Nova BH and Nova M have appealing content, such as
popular national team football events until 2022 (Euro Cup qualifiers, Euro Cup, World Cup qualifiers and
League of Nations). In March 2019, we launched Nova S in Serbia. Nova S is a channel offering high-quality
local production series, sports, talk shows with well-known national presenters and high-quality international
productions, fully exclusive to SBB, Total TV and EON. The Nova Broadcasting Group Acquisition makes us
a major content player in Bulgaria.

With our own content, we can control the end-to-end creation process, produce a wide range of attractive
local and genre specific content and maintain a structural hedge on content costs. Our in-house production
has significantly increased over recent years, and the content offered has continually improved, including by
way of the leading Sport Klub channel by adding popular sporting events to our content portfolio, which
includes some of the most popular sports offerings in the region, some of which have been temporarily
suspended and/or postponed during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we have sold distribution
rights for this channel to all major third-party distribution platforms in the region, who pay a recurring
carriage fee. Due to our own distribution platforms and our relationships with all major third-party
distribution platforms in the region, we are able to immediately distribute new channels throughout the region,
including Bulgaria following completion of the Vivacom Acquisition.

Our business model is attractive and resilient. We believe our portfolio of must have products and our superior

ability to up sell and cross-sell products. Our customers view the telecommunications products and services
that we offer as part of their everyday lives, which results in recurring, high demand for our products and
makes our business more resilient to macro-economic disruptions when compared to other discretionary
products and services. For example, during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic our products and services have
been instrumental in providing connectivity and entertainment, as an increasing number of people began to
work or study remotely and spend significant amounts of time at home, which resulted in a significant increase
in our voice and data traffic between March and May 2020. In particular, over this period, our fixed data
traffic increased at rates between 50% and 70%, while fixed voice traffic increased at rates between 50% and
85%, depending on the country. In addition, our mobile data and voice traffic increased at rates between 30%
and 40%, depending on the country. To accommodate such higher customer demand, we increased capacity
on network elements and interconnections. In this recurring, high demand environment, we believe we offer
superior products, faster broadband speeds and higher quality content than our competitors. Customer loyalty
is evidenced by our relatively low historical churn rates. Churn rate is defined as the percentage of customers
that no longer subscribe for a certain service compared to the average number of customers in a particular
month. Churn rates for a period of one year or longer are an average of the monthly average churn rate. For
the three months ended March 31, 2021, our unique cable subscriber churn rate annualized was 10%, which is
below recent reported cable subscriber churn rates of certain Western European peers. We believe our relatively
low churn rates provide, among other benefits, recurring cash flows and visibility with respect to future
revenue. Moreover, these churn rates have persisted notwithstanding regular price increases. From 2017, our
Blended Cable ARPU excluding Vivacom has grown from €20.5 for the nine months ended September 30,
2017 to €23.2 for the three months ended March 31, 2021, representing a CAGR of 3.6%. Average triple play
monthly fees have also increased across geographies, from €28 in 2013 to €33 for legacy packages (21% of
triple play base) and €34 for current EON packages (78% of triple play base) in Serbia, from €41 in 2015 to
€46 for legacy packages (28% of triple play base) and €48 for current EON packages (72% of triple play base)
in Slovenia, and from €27 in 2013 to €31 for legacy packages (21% of triple play base) and €32 for current
EON packages (78% of triple play base) in Bosnia and Herzegovina, each for the three months ended
March 31, 2021. In addition, Vivacom’s declining churn rates, together with our experience in driving customer
loyalty, present significant upside potential. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, Vivacom’s mobile
subscriber churn rate was 18% annualized compared to 25% for the year ended December 31, 2017, and its
IPTV subscriber churn rate was 11% annualized compared to 15% for the year ended December 31, 2017.

**_Our business and market positioning benefit from a well invested, advanced cable network infrastructure with a_**
**_broad reach across the region and from national mobile networks in Slovenia, Bulgaria and Croatia._**

We strive to be the most advanced media and telecommunications company in Southeastern Europe. We
operate an advanced proprietary hybrid fiber coaxial (“HFC”) network which is fully bi-directional and
EuroDOCSIS 3.0 enabled, covering all of our homes passed in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and
Montenegro, and approximately 98% of homes passed in our HFC network in Slovenia as of November 1,
2020 are fully bi-directional. We operate the largest fiber network in the region, comprised of 8,966 kilometers
of backbone and extending 10,119 kilometers across metropolitan regions in Slovenia (approximately 3,506
kilometers), Serbia (approximately 4,907 kilometers), Bosnia and Herzegovina (approximately 1,080
kilometers) and Montenegro (approximately 626 kilometers). We also operate one of the largest fiber networks
in Bulgaria, with 1.7 million (or 58%) of households in the country covered and a fully owned fiber connecting
to major points of presence across Europe. As of March 31, 2021, 91% of our core network was DOCSIS 3.1
ready. With the addition of Vivacom’s cable network, our cable network covers approximately 3.7 million
homes passed, as of March 31, 2021. Our network has an average homes passed per fiber optics node ratio in
the range of approximately 274, 213 and 234 across Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, respectively,
which we believe is unrivalled in Southeastern Europe and compares favorably to other European cable
operators, which average 562 homes passed per node on the basis of comparable peers operating in UK,
Sweden, Spain, Germany and Belgium.

We believe that our cable TV infrastructure allows us to provide higher quality digital TV, high-speed
broadband and fixed-line telephony than other cable operators in our markets. Our EuroDOCSIS 3.0 network
allows us to compete effectively in Slovenia, where fiber to the home (“FttH”) constituted approximately 44%
of the broadband market share as of December 31, 2020. We can match FttH speeds in overlapping markets
and have a service speed advantage in non-FttH areas. In Serbia, our broadband internet speed gives us an
advantage over most of our broadband internet competitors, and we provide broadband speeds of 75-1000
Mbps for the majority of our subscribers in Serbia. We also provide internet download speeds which we
believe compare favorably to the national average in Serbia with our average recorded download speed being
1.8x faster than that of one of our main competitors. Additionally, we also believe that we provide superior
internet download speeds in Slovenia with our average recorded download speed being 2.9x faster than that


-----

of one of our main competitors (which the competitor is only able to offer in certain geographic areas). In
Bosnia and Herzegovina, we are well-positioned to compete with incumbents that primarily use DSL, as well
as with smaller regional cable operators. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, we believe that our average recorded
download speed is 4.5x faster than that of one our main competitors. In Montenegro, we have developed
FttH Gigabit capable Passive Optical Networks (“GPON”) with over 25,438 homes passed and over 5,742
homes connected to this network. Following the Vivacom Acquisition, we operate the largest fiber network in
Bulgaria, providing VDSL with speeds of more than 70 Mbps for more than 50% of our network and more
than 50 Mbps for 74% of our network, with full redundancy capability and high service reliability.

Our mobile network covers the majority of Slovenia’s population through our extensive 2G/3G/4G networks,
and at present we have the capability to provide 4G (LTE) and 4G+ (LTE-A) coverage to approximately 99%
and 98%, respectively, of the Slovenian population. We are also the third largest mobile operator in Bulgaria
by market share, with approximately three million subscribers as of March 31, 2021, and provide LTE mobile
network coverage to 99.94% of the Bulgarian population. We believe Vivacom’s mobile strategy, which
includes attractive tariff plans, flexible service bundles, integrated IT systems and the fastest 4G/LTE mobile
network in Europe, has allowed it to differentiate itself from competitors and consistently gain market share
in recent years. In addition, we are the third largest telecommunications operator in Croatia based on mobile
revenues as of March 31, 2021, with a highly competitive 4G service, a signal covering all major cities and
important roads in Croatia and a growing customer base of nearly one million as of March 31, 2021. To
further develop our networks, we have successfully tested and are rolling out next generation 5G networks
across our mobile-telephony footprint. On September 21, 2020, we announced the commercial launch of our
5G network in Bulgaria, and to that end in May 2021, we secured a 20-year license for 100 MHz spectrum
frequencies in the 3.6 GHz band. We also in April 2021 secured 15-year spectrum licenses in Slovenia for 5G
frequencies, and commenced deployment and commercial launch of 5G 3600 MHz in Slovenia in June 2021.
We are participating in a 5G spectrum auction in Croatia this year.

We believe that our cable network is well invested and benefits from low maintenance UG Adjusted Capital
Expenditure requirements. We believe that this will allow us to manage our UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure
in the near to medium term, with expenditures largely being success and capacity based as our business
expands, while making targeted improvements to our network. We believe that Vivacom has a similarly well
invested network and profile. UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure was €91.3 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2021, and we estimate that UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure for the year ended December 31,
2021 will be between €371 million and €373 million (excluding mobile frequencies and any amounts for
Forthnet, Nova BG or Optima Telekom ).

**_Strong track record of profitable growth driven by low penetration rates and cross-selling opportunities, as well_**
**_as successful integration of acquisitions._**

We have a strong track record of profitable growth, underpinned by low penetration rates in the markets in
which we operate and cross-selling opportunities due to our scale, as well as a record of successfully integrating
acquisitions. We operate most of our business across the following eight countries in Southeastern Europe:
Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, North Macedonia and Montenegro.
These countries are characterized by growing Pay-TV and broadband markets that are currently
underpenetrated relative to some other CEE and Western European markets. Following the Forthnet
Acquisition we also operate in Greece. As of March 31, 2021, in Slovenia, our Pay-TV penetration of homes
passed and broadband internet penetration were 61% and 89%, respectively; in Serbia, Pay-TV penetration
and broadband internet penetration were 65% and 73%, respectively; and in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Pay-TV
penetration and broadband internet penetration were 61% and 81%, respectively. Additionally, due to
historically strong regulatory constraints on bundling Pay-TV, broadband internet and telephony services,
RGUs per cable subscriber in our key markets in Serbia, Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina have lagged
behind CEE and Western European cable markets. Markets in Bulgaria have similar characteristics. Our cable
RGUs per subscriber ratios of 2.3x for Serbia, 2.7x for Slovenia and 2.3x for Bosnia and Herzegovina, in each
case as of March 31, 2021, demonstrate that there are strong opportunities to continue to utilize up selling
and cross-selling opportunities to grow our cable RGUs per subscriber ratio in Slovenia.


-----

The following table shows comparisons of RGUs per cable subscriber in certain key CEE and Western
European markets with those of certain other industry members:

Source: Public company filings. As of March 31, 2021, for United Group, Telenet and Euskaltel and as of June 30, 2018 for the other
industry peers. The methodologies used to calculate and report RGUs and RGUs per cable subscriber by certain other industry members
may vary.

At the same time, Pay-TV penetration in all of our markets has been growing, driven by increasingly attractive
content and bundled offers. Service penetration in our markets has increased as multi-play packages have
expanded but is still below the levels of some Western European cable markets (except in Slovenia). Leveraging
our extensive cable infrastructure, we use our high-quality Pay-TV content as a basis to cross and up sell our
broadband internet and telephony products to existing cable Pay-TV customers and offer multi-play packages
to new customers, which we expect will allow us to continue to improve penetration rates as customers
increasingly focus on the convenience of receiving their multimedia and communications services in a bundled
offer from one provider. For example, while penetration rates in Slovenia are more comparable to those of
Western European operators, a substantial number of our subscribers in Slovenia are subscribed to a single
service, which we believe offers significant cross-selling opportunities. Our number of quad-play subscribers
in Slovenia has grown since we began offering mobile services in late 2012 as an MVNO, and, since the
acquisition of Tušmobil in April 2015, we have increased the number of quad-play subscribers in Slovenia,
from 1% in April 2015 to 38% as of March 31, 2021.

In addition to organic growth, we have made targeted and value accretive investments and acquisitions of
attractive cable and mobile assets, and we have been successful at integrating these acquisitions and realizing
synergies related to a number of these acquisitions, providing lessons learned and significant know-how for
integrating Vivacom, Forthnet, Nova BG and Tele2 Croatia. For example, our acquisition of Telemach
Slovenia from Liberty Global in 2009, a foray into a new market with a different language and culture, proved
to be a successful cross border acquisition story. Within a decade, we tripled blended cable ARPU of Telemach
Slovenia (from €13 in 2008, to €35 in 2018) and adjusted EBITDA (from €24 million in 2008, to €71 million in
2018), while revenue grew from €46 million in 2008 to €1.2 billion in the year ended December 31, 2020. This
was achieved through both organic growth and the acquisition of Tušmobil in April 2015 which provided us
with an opportunity to create a fully convergent cable, internet, fixed-line and mobile-telephony operator in
Slovenia, and allowed Slovenian customers to benefit from a convenient bundled product offering consisting
of cable Pay-TV, internet, fixed-line and mobile-telephony services from a single provider.

**_We have a track record of delivering revenue and UG Adjusted EBITDA growth and realizing cost synergies_**
**_related to our acquisitions while generating strong UG Adjusted EBITDA margins._**

Our revenues have historically proven to be resilient, even during periods of challenging economic conditions.
During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, almost all of our revenue streams have proven resilient and stable,
particularly those generated by our telecommunication business segments, such as broadband internet and
mobile-telephony. Since 2018, we have increased RGUs from 3.8 million as of December 31, 2018, to
10.9 million as of March 31, 2021, and we have delivered strong organic growth in both revenue and UG
Adjusted EBITDA during such period, significantly outperforming GDP growth in the countries in which we
operate. In addition to organic growth, we have benefitted from targeted and value accretive investments and
acquisitions of attractive cable and mobile assets, and have been successful in integrating these acquisitions


-----

and realizing synergies related to them. Our revenue increased to €439 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2021, compared to €194 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, and UG Adjusted
EBITDA increased to €179 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to €85 million for
the three months ended March 31, 2020. We have also proven our ability to generate strong adjusted EBITDA
margins. Despite investments in new ventures, we had operating profit margin of 11% and 7% for the
three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively, and maintained UG Adjusted EBITDA margins
of 44% and 41% for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively, highlighting our successful
approach to integrating new businesses and driving profitability.

**_A highly experienced management team with a proven track record of supporting and growing our business_**
**_and successfully integrating accretive, cross border acquisitions, with a highly committed Sponsor._**

Many of our key management members have been with the business since its inception, including our founder
and chairman of the advisory board, Dragan Šolak; chief executive officer and group vice president of
marketing and media, Victoriya Boklag; and group vice president of operations, Violeta Vasilijević. Our
senior management team also includes Janez Živko, group vice president of finance, who joined in March 2015
and had previously served as the chief financial officer of the Petrol Group, one of the largest companies in
Slovenia; Vladislav Ratajac, group vice president of corporate development, joined management in 2011,
having previously held positions at Mid Europa Partners and Deutsche Bank; Željko Batistić, group vice
president of technology who joined the group in 2012 as CEO of Telemach Bosnia and prior to that held a
number of technical and operational management positions in the industry; and Dragica Pilipović Chaffey,
group vice president of corporate affairs, joined the management team in 2009 and had previously held a
number of senior posts in the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Other members of our
senior management team also have substantial experience in the telecommunications, media and technology
industry, as well as in banking, private equity and corporate finance firms. Many members of our senior
management team, including our founder, have each held different positions within our business and have
shaped the direction of our development and growth within Southeastern Europe. As our operations have
become more mature, the senior management team has been positioned to leverage its significant industry
experience and corporate background and to successfully expand our business through bolt on acquisitions
and integration of cable assets and content companies. Furthermore, certain members of management hold
significant equity stakes in the business, which amount to approximately 42%. See “Principal Shareholders.”
Due in part to the significant international experience of most members of the senior management team, who
either attended university abroad or worked internationally for a prolonged period of time, we have
successfully grown our business from being a single country Pay-TV operator to being the telecommunications
and media services leader in Southeastern Europe.

We also intend to draw from the market expertise, business relationships, knowledge and experience of our
sponsor, BC Partners. BC Partners has strong telecommunications expertise and an extensive and successful
track record of investing in companies in Europe and in the telecommunications and information sectors
through portfolio companies that include:

- Advanced Computer Software Group, which is a leading UK provider of critical software to mid-sized
companies and public sector organizations;

- NAVEX Global, which is the global leader in ethics and compliance software as a service provider;

- Suddenlink Communications, which was the seventh largest cable operator by subscribers in the United
States prior to its acquisition by Altice USA in 2015, and which BC Partners fully exited in 2020;

- Com Hem, Sweden’s leading cable TV and broadband operator, which was successfully floated on the
Nasdaq Stockholm exchange in 2014 and which BC Partners fully exited in 2017; and

- Unitymedia, an integrated telecoms service provider and the second-largest cable company in Germany,
which BC Partners sold to Liberty Global in 2009 after growing the business through acquisitions and
operational improvements.

BC Partners has a strong track record of driving cost savings and improvements in margin, while at the same
time growing its portfolio companies both organically and through targeted acquisitions.

**Strategy**

Our goal is to strengthen our telecommunications and media leadership position in Southeastern Europe and
to continue our strong growth momentum by successfully integrating Vivacom, Tele2 Croatia, Forthnet,
Nova BG, Optima Telekom and other acquisitions and by leveraging our competitive strengths: well invested


-----

fixed and mobile networks, differentiated content offerings and local production capabilities and a loyal
customer base. Our focus is on continuing to provide our customers the best products and services in each of
our segments and markets, including more innovative products and features, a superior customer experience
and better value compared to competitors. In parallel, our goals are to continue to deliver exceptional revenue
growth across segments (both organically and through strategic acquisitions) and capitalize on operating
leverage and continued operating efficiencies to deliver strong profitability and cash flow growth.

In order to achieve these goals, we have identified the following strategic pillars:

**_Continued focus on our competitive market position by leveraging our advanced network, differentiated_**
**_content offerings and loyal customer base._**

We have differentiated ourselves with our customers by having superior next generation infrastructure in our
footprint. Where we believe the return on investment is appropriate, we will continue to expand the coverage
and capacity of those networks, including 5G capability. Our strategy is to continue to offer the most attractive
products in Southeastern Europe with better content choice, speed, functionality and service quality than
those of our competitors, at prices that provide a compelling value. We will continue to deliver value to our
customers based on a consistent and effective strategy that is underpinned by simplicity, value for money and
innovation. We believe that our acquisitions of Vivacom, Tele2 Croatia, Forthnet, Nova BG and Optima
Telekom are in line with a strategy of expanding coverage in Southeastern Europe and will enable the
development of our business in attractive markets.

**_Increase service penetration across the region by cross-selling products and services and up selling value adding_**
**_products to existing customers._**

We intend to continue to focus on subscriber growth opportunities in our relatively under penetrated markets.
Over time, we expect our businesses in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina to converge with Slovenia in terms
of broadband and Pay-TV penetration as well as in service penetration (measured by RGU per subscriber).

We aim to achieve an increase in triple play (and in the case of Slovenia and Bulgaria, quad-play) penetration
by continuing to shift focus in marketing and subscriber interactions from single services to bundled services
and utilizing next generation digital television services, attractive local content and high-speed broadband
services to continue to promote bundled services. We have significantly grown our mobile business and
developed our multi-play (including quad-play) offering in Slovenia, and we intend to continue to build on
that success in Bulgaria, where the Vivacom Acquisition has significantly expanded our addressable market,
and provide further opportunities for cross-selling and multi-play bundling. In particular, we intend to leverage
Vivacom’s high-quality 4G/LTE network to expand its leadership in mobile data and build on its track record
of subscriber growth. In addition, we aim to retain and grow Vivacom’s existing customer base by competing
on value, for example, by offering more add on products, incentivizing longer term contracts by offering
better pricing and subsidies for certain products, offering bundled services to decrease churn, including
premium Pay-TV services and providing FTTx solutions in larger cities to satisfy customer demand for high
broadband speeds.

We also intend to capitalize on our superior high-speed broadband capabilities to increase revenue. Specifically,
we intend to migrate our existing high-speed broadband subscribers to higher speeds, which we believe will
continue to support broadband ARPU growth and further reduce residential subscriber churn rates. In
addition, recent acquisitions have enhanced our ability to monetize premium content, cross promote and
generate compelling cost synergies.

**_Consolidate United Media as the leading media company in Southeastern Europe._**

Since inception, our strategy has been centered on differentiating our offering by producing superior and/or
exclusive Pay-TV channels for our customers. We have applied this philosophy to all of our Group companies
with great success, and we have created an attractive portfolio of full format national as well as specialized,
thematic Pay-TV channels that we believe are a must have on all regional distribution platforms. Following the
Vivacom Acquisition, with the integration of Vivacom and Nova BG into our operations, we are applying
this philosophy in Bulgaria. We intend to continue to grow our content offering by further developing our
portfolio of owned content, entering into strategic partnerships with third-party content owners and acquiring
content owners, as in the past with the acquisition of Nova TV Croatia and Direct Media/Pink.

**_Further expand our addressable market by utilizing our OTT platform and attractive content._**

Leveraging our strong brands and our attractive content, we intend to continue to develop our two OTT
content platforms, our regional OTT platform, EON, and our international OTT platform, NetTV Plus, to


-----

further expand our addressable market to areas outside our cable footprint. While our DTH Pay-TV platform
aims to deliver our content to subscribers in rural areas in our markets without cable infrastructure, our
regional OTT platform enables customers in metropolitan areas outside of our cable footprint, who have
subscribed to the broadband internet services of our competitors, to access our attractive portfolio of Pay-TV
channels and unique user interface and customer experience. Additionally, NetTV Plus allows us to provide
over 200 local language channels showing ethnic content to the entire ex-Yugoslav diaspora around the world.
By expanding our geographic reach outside of Southeastern Europe to customers in countries in Western
Europe and North America, we believe that we are positioned to further increase our RGU base and earnings
potential. We also plan to further invest in our in-house development of customer premises equipment,
including OTT TV boxes for EON, which enables video streaming to customers’ TVs and allows us to offer
services on competitors’ broadband networks.

**_Continued focus on innovation._**

We seek to continue innovating and enhancing our product offering to further strengthen our leading position
in Southeastern Europe. Our in-house technology innovation and software development center, United.Cloud,
enables us to focus on leading the introduction of next generation television and broadband internet services
by delivering to subscribers services such as EON (our next generation video delivery platform that includes
linear and non-linear digital broadcasting, over 22,000 VoD assets, CatchUp TV, a Smart TV application for
Samsung and LG and a multiscreen service for mobile, tablet and personal computer/laptop devices),
UNIFON (our proprietary VoIP application connecting customers’ fixed-line telephones outside of their
homes), our self-help application, enhanced TV features such as VoD and CatchUp TV services and many
others. We will also continue to promote the digitalization of internal and external processes to improve
customer satisfaction and profitability. In July 2020, we leveraged our position in both the broadband and
Pay-TV markets to launch Shoppster, our regional e-commerce online-shopping platform, which will initially
offer more than 20 popular product categories, including electronics, home and gardening, tools, fashion,
items for children and kitchen appliances. We intend for Shoppster to deliver the simple, reliable and secure
e-shopping experience that modern consumers expect.

**_Continue to grow customer base and operations through value accretive acquisitions._**

We have a successful track record of making acquisitions on attractive terms and successfully integrating
those acquisitions. Between 2011 and March 31, 2021, we have acquired and integrated (or are in the process
of integrating) approximately 50 cable TV operators, content platforms, media companies, mobile service
providers, B2B service providers and internet service providers (“ISPs”) in Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and
Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Greece, Croatia and Montenegro. We have also expanded our addressable market
through the Vivacom Acquisition and Nova Broadcasting Group Acquisition (in Bulgaria), the Forthnet
Acquisition (in Greece) and the Optima Telekom Acquisition (in Croatia), as well as various other recent
acquisitions. Our acquisition strategy consists of expanding our scale in a value accretive manner, enhancing
our content offering, expanding our fixed-line and mobile-telephony operations and leveraging our experience
and successful acquisition history to continue to make acquisitions that allow us to generate additional value
for our operations through increasing scale and product offerings.

We plan to continue to make value accretive acquisitions at attractive multiples to integrate regional service
providers, cable assets and fixed-line and mobile-telephony operators into the business, and we intend to
continue taking a disciplined approach to acquisitions by assessing individual opportunities on the basis of
merit, ability to integrate assets into our existing business plans and potential for value creation.

**_Continue to Focus on Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (“ESG”) Matters_**

We and our shareholders recognize that achieving a sustainable and responsible business that has a positive
social impact will be key to our future success. As we have grown our Group, we have increased our emphasis
on integrating ESG considerations into our decision-making and reporting processes. In 2020, we established
a dedicated ESG coordinator role within the Group and finalized a detailed ESG action plan and
implementation roadmap in consultation with external advisors.

To promote environmental sustainability in our operations, we are taking active steps to minimize our
environmental footprint, while also collecting and analyzing Group historical data to set future KPI targets
for reductions in carbon emissions, climate change policy, energy use and energy sourcing. We have committed
to the Science Based Targets initiative which helps to drive climate action in the private sector by enabling
companies to set emissions reduction targets with scientific data. We are committed to reducing greenhouse
gas emissions across our offices and infrastructure and we established a solar power plant in Slovenia in 2019


-----

with an annual production capacity of 254 kWh and have leveraged our experience in this project to look for
additional green energy projects which could cover a significant part of our carbon emission footprint. In
addition, we use electric vehicles in our operations where feasible, and we work to exchange old, less-energy
efficient equipment for more energy-efficient devices. In 2020, we generated approximately 128.1 thousand
tons of CO2 emissions (9.3 thousand tons of scope 1 emissions and 118.8 thousand tons of scope 2 and
3 emissions), including the contribution of acquired companies, and we intend to reduce these to
approximately 50.6 thousand tons by 2030. In 2020, we recycled 1,539 tons of network telecom equipment,
batteries, cables, paper and cardboard. We are also committed to minimizing waste and we repurpose, reuse or
recycle 100% of returned customer devices and accessories.

We actively support the communities in which we operate, and in 2020, we named a Group-level director for
corporate social responsibility to coordinate efforts in this regard among our operating companies. We have
as a Group donated €4.5 million in 2020 and €2.0 million for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, to
groups and activities dedicated to protecting the environment, education and the socially vulnerable, as well
as other donations, such as donating personal protective equipment to help fight COVID-19. We have also
engaged in multiple community engagement activities in the past few years, with a focus on using our platform
to deliver knowledge to children (including programs for online safety), students, the general public and
disadvantaged groups, by leveraging our core competencies in broadband internet and other
telecommunications. For 2021, we aim to increase the percentage of staff participating in a community
engagement activity (e.g., volunteering time or knowledge), which in 2020 stood at 7%.

We focus on building a safe, fair and inclusive working environment for our employees. To inform our diversity,
inclusion and safety targets, we collect data on our workforce, such as gender mix (55% male, 45% female),
percentage of women in management positions (30%, including our Chief Executive Officer) and percentage
of disabled employees (1%), in each case as of March 31, 2021. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2021,
staff total turnover is 12% and we have experienced 50 workplace injury incidents. We also have mandated
diversity and inclusion rules, and have documented these in employee manuals at our Group companies,
which include, among others, statutory requirements related to workers’ rights and human rights (e.g., antidiscrimination and anti-mobbing) and annual employee Net Promoter Score (“eNPS”) measurements. To
facilitate further transparency and accountability, we plan to expand our anonymous suggestion boxes already
present in certain of our Group companies and establish whistle-blowing programs as a distinct transparency
function. We also offer training programs to employees which are focused on improving job-related technical
and management skills, as well as on compliance with our internal policies.

**Recent Developments**

**_COVID-19 Impact on Revenues and Adjusted EBITDA_**

Based on our analysis, we estimate that the COVID-19 pandemic had a minimal impact of approximately 1-2%
to organic consolidated revenues during 2020 as compared to 2019 and during the three months ended
March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020. The revenue streams most negatively
affected include advertising, media selling and mobile handsets sales. Following the COVID-19 outbreak in
March 2020, we implemented cost optimization initiatives and managed our capital expenditure plans in
response to the pandemic, but we did so in a way that would not hinder our ability for future growth and
quality of services provided.

Our telecommunications segments have continued to meet customers’ expectations on service level and our
network operating centers have maintained normal service levels. Based on this, no significant change in our
customer base occurred. As customers were unlikely or unable to easily migrate during the crisis, in 2020 we
experienced somewhat lower gross adds and churn rates, with our operations normalizing during 2021.
Organic revenues and UG Adjusted EBITDA in our telecommunications segment remained stable during
2020 compared to the previous year.


-----

During the first waves of lockdowns imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic between March and
May 2020, as an increasing number of people began to work or study remotely and spend significant amounts
of time at home, we saw a significant increase in our voice and data traffic. In particular, over this period, our
fixed data traffic increased at rates between 50% and 70%, while fixed voice traffic increased at rates between
50% and 85%, depending on the country. In addition, our mobile data and voice traffic increased at rates
between 30% and 40%, depending on the country. To accommodate such higher customer demand, we
increased capacity on network elements and interconnections.

In our Media segment, we estimate that organic revenue in the segment declined by approximately 5-6% for
the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the previous year. This decline was due in part to the
postponement of certain sporting events and a decline in advertising revenue, partially offset by a decline in
relevant costs. Overall, supported by cost optimization efforts, UG Adjusted EBITDA in the Media segment
remained broadly stable year on year prior to giving effect to the Nova Broadcasting Group Acquisition.
During the three months ended March 31, 2021, we have seen levels of organic advertising increasing and
surpassing pre-COVID levels.

Throughout the pandemic, we have continued to grow the Group through acquisitions, completing the
acquisitions of Tele2 Croatia (completed in March 2020), Vivacom (completed in July 2020), Forthnet
(completed in November 2020) and Nova BG (completed in January 2021). The impact of COVID-19 on
these acquired companies is similar to that of the Group’s existing telecommunications operations. The
expected contribution of the acquired companies has not materially changed given the crisis and all such
acquired companies are performing in line with or above our expectations.

**_Acquisition of Optima Telekom_**

On July 9, 2021, we announced that we signed an agreement to acquire a majority interest of 54.31% in
Croatian telecom operation Optima Telekom, for an estimated purchase price of €85 million based on an
enterprise value of HRK 639 million, from Hrvatski Telekom and Zagrebacka Banka. Optima Telekom offers
a broad range of fixed broadband internet services to approximately 117 thousand subscribers and pay-TV
services to approximately 57 thousand subscribers in Croatia. Completion of the Optima Telekom Acquisition
is expected for the end of 2021 and is subject to customary conditions as well as the implementation of certain
changes in the current Croatian telecommunication legislation relating to vertical integration between pay-TV
broadcasters and distributors, and thus there can be no assurance that the acquisition will be completed by
such expected date or at all. Once completed, the acquisition of Optima Telekomwill allow us to further
expand our presence in the Croatian market enabling Telemach Croatia to offer a full range of
telecommunication services, including pay-TV, through its existing infrastructure. Optima Telekom had
estimated last two quarters annualized adjusted EBITDA for March 31, 2021 of €16.8 million. Following
completion of the Optima TelekomAcquisition, we expect to be required to undertake a tender offer for the
remaining shares of Optima Telekom not yet acquired.

**_Existing Revolving Credit Facility 2021 Increase_**

On or about the Issue Date, the Company expects to receive additional commitments from certain lenders in
respect of the Existing Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate amount up to €75 million, increasing the
total commitments under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility from €250 million up to €325 million.

**_Recent Trading_**

Based on preliminary results from our unaudited management accounts for the two-month period ended
May 31, 2021, and other information currently available, we estimate that our revenue for the two months
ended May 31, 2021 will be between €309.2 million and €313.2 million, compared to €144.1 million for the
corresponding period of 2020. Estimated revenue of United Group increased compared to the prior-year
period due to the significant impacts of the Vivacom Acquisition, the Forthnet Acquisition and the Nova
Broadcasting Group Acquisition, none of which were included in such prior-year period. We estimate that
EBITDA for United Group for the two-month period ended May 31, 2021 (excluding any adjustments), will
be between €131.7 million and €135.7 million compared to €62.0 million for the two-month period ended
May 31, 2020.

Financial data in this “Recent Trading” section is based on our preliminary management accounts and has
not been audited, reviewed or verified by our independent auditors, and you should not place undue reliance
on it. During the course of our financial statement completion process for the six months ended June 30,
2021, and for the year ended December 31, 2021, we could identify items that would require adjustments to be
made and which could affect the final results of operations and financial position for the periods described in
this section.

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, certain perfection
requirements and any Permitted Collateral Liens, within 120 days
following (and not including) the Issue Date, the New Notes and the
Guarantees are also expected to be secured by security over the shares
of each Vivacom Guarantor (together, the “Vivacom Collateral”).

The Issue Date Collateral, the Post-Issue Date Collateral and the
Vivacom Collateral, together with any and all other assets from time
to time in which a security interest has been or will be granted
pursuant to any security document to secure obligations under the
Indenture and the New Notes, is collectively referred to herein as the
“Collateral,”and such security documents pursuant to which security
has been granted to secure obligations under the Indenture and the
New Notes, are collectively referred to herein as the “Security
Documents.”

Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain assets will not be pledged (or
the liens not perfected) in accordance with the Agreed Security
Principles, as described under “Description of the New Notes—
_Security—The Collateral.”_

**Use of Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . .** Proceeds of the Offering will be used by the Issuer (i) to pay the
purchase price for the Optima Telekom Acquisition, (ii) to repay
certain obligations outstanding under the Existing Revolving Credit
Facility, (iii) for general corporate purposes, which may include
potential future acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures
and other purposes, and (iv) to pay transaction costs associated with
the Offering. See “Use of Proceeds.”

**Additional Amounts . . . . . . . . .** All payments the Issuer or any Guarantor makes with respect to the
New Notes will be made without withholding or deduction for taxes


-----

unless required by applicable law. If withholding or deduction for
such taxes is required by law to be made in any “relevant taxing
jurisdiction” with respect to a payment on the New Notes, subject to
certain exceptions, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will pay the
additional amounts necessary so that the net amount received by the
holders of the New Notes after the withholding or deduction is not
less than the amount that they would have received in the absence of
such withholding or deduction. See “Description of the New Notes—
_Withholding Taxes.”_

**Optional Redemption of the New**
**Notes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Prior to, 2024, the Issuer will be entitled at its option to
redeem all or a portion of the New Notes at a redemption price equal
to 100% of the principal amount of the New Notes, plus the
applicable “make-whole” premium described in this offering
memorandum and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption
date.

At any time prior to, 2024, the Issuer may on one or
more occasions redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount
of the New Notes, using the net proceeds from certain equity
offerings at a redemption price equal to % of the principal
amount of the New Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any, to the date of redemption; provided that
at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the New
Notes (including the principal amount of any additional notes)
remains outstanding after the redemption (unless all Notes of such
series are redeemed substantially concurrently).

In addition, prior to, 2024, the Issuer may redeem during
each calendar year up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of
the New Notes (calculated after giving effect to the issuance of any
additional notes) at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal
amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest.

The Issuer may redeem all or part of the New Notes at any time on or
after, 2024, at the redemption prices described under
“Description of the New Notes—Optional Redemption,” plus accrued
and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of
redemption.

**Optional Redemption for Tax**
**Reasons . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** In the event of certain developments affecting taxation, the Issuer
may redeem the New Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time, at a
redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, to (but not
including) the date of redemption. See “Description of the New
_Notes—Redemption for Taxation Reasons.”_

**Change of Control . . . . . . . . . .** If the Company experiences a change of control, as defined in the
Indenture, the holders of the New Notes will have the right to require
the Issuer to offer to repurchase the New Notes at a purchase price
equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and additional amounts, if any, to (but not including) the
date of repurchase. However, a change of control will not be deemed
to have occurred in respect of the New Notes if a specified
consolidated net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with
such event. See “Description of the New Notes—Change of Control.”

**Certain Covenants . . . . . . . . . .** The Indenture restricts, among other things, the ability of the
Company and its restricted subsidiaries to:

                        - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain
preferred stock;


-----

                        - pay dividends, redeem capital stock and make certain
investments;

                        - make certain other restricted payments;

                        - create or permit to exist certain liens;

                        - impose restrictions on the ability of the restricted subsidiaries to
pay dividends;

                        - transfer or sell certain assets;

                        - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the
New Notes.

qualifications. See “Description _of_ _the_ _New_ _Notes—Certain_
_Covenants.”_

Act (including by way of an exchange offer).

**Absence of a Public Market for**

the Securities Act.

_The summary unaudited pro forma financial data is based on available information and certain assumptions that_
_we believe are reasonable. The summary unaudited pro forma financial data is presented for illustrative purposes_


-----

_only and is not intended to represent or be indicative of the results of operations that we would have reported had_
_the Vivacom Transactions actually occurred during the period presented, and the summary unaudited pro forma_

_pro forma financial data has not been prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X under the_
_Securities Act, the EU Prospectus Regulation or any generally accepted accounting standards. For more_

_Information.”_

_We also present certain other Non-IFRS Measures below, which are listed in “Presentation of Financial Data—_
_Financial Data Included in This Offering Memorandum—Non-IFRS Financial and Operating Data.” These_
_measures are presented in this offering memorandum because we believe that they and similar measures are_
_widely used in the telecommunications industry as a means of evaluating a company’s operating performance and_
_financing structure. These measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies_
_and are not measurements under IFRS or other generally accepted accounting principles, and you should not_
_consider such items as alternatives to net income (loss), operating income or any other performance measures_
_derived in accordance with IFRS, and they may be different from similarly titled measures used by other_
_companies. Our management believes this data, along with comparable IFRS measures, is useful to investors_
_because it provides a basis for measuring the operating performance in the periods presented. These measures are_
_used in the internal management of our business, along with the most directly comparable IFRS financial_
_measures, in evaluating the operating performance. Non-IFRS measures have limitations as analytical tools, and_
_you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results or any performance measures_
_under IFRS as set forth in the Company Audited Financial Statements, the Company Unaudited Interim_
_Financial Statements, the Vivacom Audited Financial Statements or the Vivacom Unaudited Interim Financial_
_Statements. For more information, see “Presentation of Financial Data.”_

to in order to receive the Group’s other services such as broadband internet access and telephony, with the exception of Bulgaria.
A unique cable subscriber may subscribe to several different services, thereby accounting for only one unique cable subscriber, but
several RGUs.

(3) Cable Pay-TV RGUs includes (i) the sum of our analog and digital cable Pay-TV RGUs in Slovenia, (ii) our total analog cable
Pay-TV RGUs (without separately counting analog cable RGUs that have purchased digital top ups) in Serbia, Bosnia and
Herzegovina and Montenegro and (iii) our analog and digital cable Pay-TV RGUs in Bulgaria.

(4) OTT consists of our NetTV Plus and out of footprint EON subscribers.

(5) Broadband internet RGUs represents residential broadband internet provided within our network footprint.

(6) Fixed-line telephony RGUs represents residential fixed-line telephony provided within our network footprint.

(7) Mobile RGUs represents mobile-telephony services provided to customers in Slovenia, where we have operated as an MNO since
our acquisition of Tušmobil in April 2015. Following completion of the acquisition of Tele2 Croatia in March 2020, we also
provide mobile-telephony services in Croatia, and following the completion of the acquisition of Vivacom in July 2020, we also
provide mobile-telephony services in Bulgaria.

(8) Other services include multichannel multipoint distribution service-based services, ADSL internet services and B2B services.

(9) RGU Penetration represents for cable Pay-TV the number of unique cable subscribers at the end of the relevant period as
a percentage of the number of homes passed by our network, and for broadband internet the number of RGUs at the end of the
relevant period as a percentage of the number of unique cable subscribers.


-----

(10) Blended Cable ARPU is calculated by adding together, for each month in a given period, the total cable Pay-TV, broadband
internet and fixed-line telephony revenues (including fixed-line telephony usage revenues and excluding minor installation fees) for
that particular month divided by the average number of unique cable subscribers for that month and then dividing that sum by the
total number of months in the period. Blended Cable ARPU does not include mobile ARPU, which was €10.9 for the year ended
December 31, 2018, €10.8 for the year ended December 31, 2019, €9.5 for the year ended December 31, 2020, €11.0 for the
three months ended March 31, 2020 and €8.8 for the three months ended March 31, 2021. We calculate mobile ARPU by adding
together, for each month in a given period, the total mobile-telephony revenues (excluding revenues generated by customers of
other networks roaming on our network and excluding wholesale revenues) for that particular month divided by the average number
of mobile RGUs for that month and then dividing that sum by the total number of months in the period. In addition, following the
Vivacom Acquisition, we amended the definition of certain key operating measures (Homes Passed, Unique Cable Subscribers and
Blended Cable ARPU) in order to align the calculation methodology across the Group. As a result, Bended Cable ARPU figures
were restated for the periods starting from January 1, 2018 onwards.

(11) As of January 1, 2019, we changed our reporting methodology in regards to certain key operating measures, which has resulted in
immaterial differences as compared to previous periods. For the year ended December 31, 2018, OTT users on our network have
been reclassified to Cable and Cable services users on other networks have been reclassified to Other Services from Cable. This
change has an immaterial effect on all subscriber, RGU, ARPU and churn data for the year ended December 31, 2018, and such key
operating measures have been restated for such periods in line with this new reporting methodology.

(1) UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure represents capital expenditure, as adjusted by intragroup adjustments, the application of IFRS
15 for acquisition costs in SBB Serbia, assets held for sale and overflow between periods. UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure is
prepared based on management accounts and not IFRS. For a reconciliation of capital expenditure to UG Adjusted Capital
Expenditure, see “Reconciliation of Certain Financial Data Presented Herein.”

Intragroup adjustments relate to unrealized profit on the intragroup sale of end-user equipment by SBB Serbia. When SBB Serbia
sells this equipment to other United Group companies in compliance with applicable transfer pricing requirements, it makes an
unrealized profit on the sale. These unrealized profits are eliminated for the purposes of preparing our accounts in accordance with
IFRS, but are not eliminated for the purpose of our management accounts.

Assets held for sale relate to programming rights acquired by our Media Group segment for other Group segments which were
recognized under IFRS as intangible assets and were invoiced to other Group segments after March 31, 2021.

The application of IFRS 15 for acquisition costs in SBB Serbia reflects the additional effect of harmonizing our accounting policy
with respect to the capitalization of subscriber acquisition costs for rebinding, upselling and cross-selling (which in the past were
not eligible to be capitalized, but under IFRS 15 qualify for capitalization), which were determined subsequent to the preparation
of our management accounts.

Overflow between periods relates to the fact that our management accounts are closed prior to the closing of our accounts prepared
in accordance with IFRS. Overflow between periods in any given period reflects the additional capital expenditure incurred between
the preparation of our management accounts and our accounts prepared in accordance with IFRS for such period.

UG EBITDA is a supplemental measure of financial performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with IFRS.
We define “UG EBITDA”as Profit/(Loss) for the period plus income tax (benefit)/expense, depreciation, amortization of intangible
assets and net finance costs and share of profit/loss of an equity-accounted investee.

UG EBITDA is not a measurement of performance or liquidity under IFRS and you should not consider UG EBITDA as an
alternative to (a) net income (as determined in accordance with IFRS as a measure of our operating performance), (b) cash
flow for the period as a measure of our ability to meet our cash needs, or (c) any other measure of performance or liquidity
under IFRS. We present UG EBITDA and the ratios derived therefrom, because we believe that they are measures commonly
used by investors and they are measures that we use in managing our business. UG EBITDA, as presented in this offering
memorandum, however, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences
in the way these measures are calculated. See “Presentation of Financial Data—Non-IFRS Financial and Operating Data.”

(3) UG Adjusted EBITDA represents UG EBITDA, adjusted for certain exceptional items, such as shareholder related costs,
impairment charges, M&A related costs and group restructuring costs, which the Group views as non-operating. Management
believes that excluding these components provides useful information to investors and others in evaluating the Company’s operating
performance, financing structure and understanding the performance of our core business described below for each of the periods
presented.

The following table provides a reconciliation of UG EBITDA to UG Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31,
2021. For a reconciliation of Profit/(Loss) to UG EBITDA for the same period presented, see footnote (2) under this “Company

Starting from 2021, the Group applied IFRS 16 in its management account reporting. Accordingly, the Group has adjusted the
calculation of its UG Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020 presented in this offering memorandum to enhance
comparibility, while in 2019 the calculation remained unchanged. As a result, UG Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended
December 31, 2019 is presented in accordance with the formula used historically and may not be fully comparable with UG
Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020.

The following table provides a reconciliation of UG EBITDA to UG Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31,
2020. For a reconciliation of Profit/(Loss) to UG EBITDA for the same period presented, see footnote (2) under this “Company

(1) Homes passed represents all homes connected to fiber network, either FTTH or FTTB.

(2) Mobile subscribers are reported based on the number of active mobile SIM cards. In line with the prevailing methodology in
Bulgaria for calculating post-paid mobile subscribers, post-paid mobile subscribers are counted in the subscriber base as long as
they have an active contract, have an active billing status (i.e., subscribers who regularly pay their bills) and have not been
disconnected from the network, which includes machine to machine connections. Pre-paid mobile subscribers are counted in the


-----

subscriber base in line with the prevailing methodology for doing so in the Bulgarian mobile telecommunications market, whereby
pre-paid mobile subscribers are counted in the subscriber base if they have had an activity event (such as outgoing and incoming
customer generated usage or recharge) within the last 90 days.

(3) Fixed-telephony subscribers are counted in the subscriber base as long as they have an active billing status (i.e., subscribers who
regularly pay their bills). Subscribers are counted in channels: PSTN = 1; ISDN BRA = 2; ISDN PRA; and R2D = 30 channels.

(4) Fixed broadband subscribers are reported based on technical installations and the number of subscribers who have an active billing
status (subscribers who regularly pay their bills).

(5) Fixed Pay-TV subscribers are reported based on technical installations and the number of subscribers who have an active billing
status (subscribers who regularly pay their bills).

(6) Blended mobile ARPU is defined as the sum of the monthly mobile services revenue in the period, divided by the average number
of mobile subscribers in the period, divided by the number of months in that period. The average number of mobile subscribers
during a period is calculated by adding together the number of active mobile SIM cards at the beginning and end of each month
during the period, dividing by two and then averaging the results from all months during the period. For purposes of calculating
blended mobile ARPU, mobile services revenue consist of revenue generated from monthly subscription fees, usage fees for services
that are incremental to the services allocated with the monthly subscription fees and mobile interconnect revenue (i.e., from fees
paid to us by other operators for calls terminated on Vivacom’s mobile network, including roaming charges by Vivacom’s customers)
as well as the expired balance revenue for pre-paid SIM cards, but does not include revenue such as revenue generated from mobile
handset sales and revenue from roaming charges incurred by customers of other operators using Vivacom’s network. The blended
mobile ARPU presented above in euro was converted from Bulgarian levs using the rate of BGN 1.9558 per €1.00, which is the rate
at which the Bulgarian lev is pegged to the euro.

(7) Fixed-telephony ARPU is defined as the sum of the monthly fixed-telephony revenue in the period, divided by the average number
of fixed-telephony subscribers in the period, divided by the number of months in that period. The average number of fixedtelephony subscribers in a period is calculated by adding together the number of fixed-telephony subscribers at the beginning and
end of each month during the period, dividing by two and then averaging the results from all months during the period. For
purposes of calculating fixed-telephony ARPU, fixed-telephony revenue includes revenue generated from monthly subscription
fees, usage fees for services that are incremental to the services allocated with monthly subscription fees and landline termination
rates (i.e., fees paid by other operators for calls terminated on Vivacom’s landline network), but does not include revenue generated
from wholesale voice. The fixed-telephony ARPU presented above in euro was converted from Bulgarian levs using the rate of
BGN 1.9558 per €1.00, which is the rate at which the Bulgarian lev is pegged to the euro.

(8) Fixed broadband ARPU is defined as the sum of the monthly fixed broadband revenue in the period, divided by the average
number of fixed broadband subscribers in the period, divided by the number of months in that period. The average number of
fixed broadband subscribers in a period is calculated by adding together the number of fixed broadband subscribers at the beginning
and end of each month during the period, dividing by two and then averaging the results from all months during the period. For
purposes of calculating fixed broadband ARPU, fixed broadband revenue includes revenue generated from monthly subscription
fees but does not include dial up revenue, revenue from the sale of customer premises equipment, such as modems and initial set up
charges and revenue generated from the provision of business data and connectivity solutions such as VPN and MAN services. The
fixed broadband ARPU presented above in euro was converted from Bulgarian levs using the rate of BGN 1.9558 per €1.00, which
is the rate at which the Bulgarian lev is pegged to the euro.

(9) Fixed Pay-TV ARPU is defined as the sum of the monthly fixed Pay-TV revenue in the period (IPTV and DTH), divided by the
average number of fixed Pay-TV subscribers (IPTV and DTH) in the period, divided by the number of months in that period. The
average number of fixed Pay-TV subscribers in a period is calculated by adding together the number of fixed Pay-TV subscribers at
the beginning and end of each month during the period, dividing by two and then averaging the results from all months during the
period. For purposes of calculating fixed Pay-TV ARPU, fixed Pay-TV revenue includes revenue generated from monthly
subscription fees and packages with additional content. The fixed Pay-TV ARPU presented above in euro was converted from
Bulgarian levs using the rate of BGN 1.9558 per €1.00, which is the rate at which the Bulgarian lev is pegged to the euro.

(10) As of the end of 2018, Vivacom changed its reporting methodology for fixed wireless broadband (Mobix) subscribers, which were
reclassified and presented as mobile subscribers. The reclassification has impacted subscribers, RGU and ARPU. Previous periods
have been restated in line with this new reporting methodology.

(a) Vivacom financial information has been derived from Note 30 to the Vivacom Unaudited Interim Financial Statements.
Financial information for the seven months ended July 31, 2020 is derived by taking the financial data for nine months ended
September 30, 2020, and subtracting the financial information for the two months ended September 30, 2020 (which has not
been reviewed or audited). The financial information is prepared in Bulgarian levs (BGN).

(b) Amounts were converted using the BGN/EUR exchange rate of BGN 1.9558 to EUR 1.00, the pegged rate for the period.

(c) The adjustments presented have been made to reclassify Vivacom line items to conform to the Company’s basis of
preparation. Such adjustments have no effect on profit for the period reported.

(d) The purpose of the adjustment is to illustrate the effects of:

(i) eliminating the effect of transactions between Vivacom and Viva Telecom Bulgaria EOOD

The Group acquired Viva Telecom Bulgaria EOOD (formerly, Viva Telecom Bulgaria OOD) in the Vivacom Acquisition.
Viva Telecom Bulgaria EOOD is a holding company of the Vivacom Group but does not itself prepare consolidated financial
information. The pro forma financial information of Vivacom included herein is based on the Vivacom Unaudited Interim
Financial Statements and therefore certain adjustments are made to eliminate the effect of transactions between Vivacom
and Viva Telecom Bulgaria EOOD. An adjustment was made to eliminate intercompany transactions, comprising an interest
income amounting to €6,262 thousand and reversal of impairment cost amounting to €303 thousand and related tax effects.

(ii) purchase price allocation

The purchase price allocation was finalized as of December 31, 2020 and therefore the Company Audited Financial
Statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, include the fair value adjustments that have been made to acquired assets
and liabilities (including any associated deferred tax effects), and differences between total consideration paid for the
acquisition and the estimated fair values of the net assets of Vivacom were recorded as goodwill. The Company identified
and measured significant identifiable assets such as: trade name, customer base—fixed services, customer base—mobile
services, licenses, software and distribution network. The value of the items of property, plant and equipment and intangible
assets increased significantly. As a result of the newly identified intangible assets and the significant increase to the value of
the existing items of property, plant and equipment, additional amortization and depreciation charges were estimated and
added as adjustments to the of Vivacom financial data for the seven months ended July 31, 2020. The amount of additional
amortization and depreciation was estimated based on the value allocated to specific assets and the remaining useful life of


-----

those assets. The adjustments for the additional amortization and depreciation charges are amounting to €44,382 thousand
and related tax benefit amounting to €4,438 thousand.

(e) The adjustments presented have been made to align Vivacom’s accounting policies with IFRS as adopted and applied by the
Company under its currently applied accounting policies. Vivacom (i) capitalizes subscriber acquisition costs for contracts
below one year and (ii) capitalizes portability costs, while such costs are expensed as incurred by the Company and (iii) for
related tax effects of the foregoing.

**Financing adjustments . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **13,952**

The senior secured notes related to the 2020 Notes Financing were issued on February 6, 2020. For the purposes of the Unaudited
Pro Forma Financial Information, additional interest for the period from January 1, 2020 to the 2020 Notes Issue Date was
calculated using the effective interest rates attributable to this financing.

The remaining adjustments relate to reversal of costs included in the historical financial information of the Company and of
Vivacom attributable to financing that was repaid from the proceeds of the 2020 Notes Financing.

(4) Adjusted Capital Expenditure represents capital expenditure as adjusted by intragroup adjustments, adjustments related to the
timing of recognition of additions of assets and overflow between periods. Adjusted capital expenditure is prepared on the basis of
management accounts and not IFRS. Reconciliation of capital expenditure as derived from financial statements to Adjusted Capital
Expenditure is as follows:

(a) Vivacom financial data was derived from Vivacom’s accounting records in BGN and converted to EUR using the BGN/EUR
exchange rate of BGN 1.9558 to EUR 1.00.

(b) Capital expenditure includes increases in right of use assets recognized under IFRS 16.

(5) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental measures of financial performance that are not required by, or presented in
accordance with, IFRS. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not a measurement of performance or liquidity under IFRS and you
should not consider EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to (a) net income (as determined in accordance with IFRS as
a measure of our operating performance), (b) cash flow for the period as a measure of our ability to meet our cash needs, or (c) any
other measure of performance or liquidity under IFRS. We present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and the ratios derived
therefrom, because we believe that they are measures commonly used by investors and they are measures that we use in managing
our business. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as presented in this offering memorandum, however, may not be comparable to
similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in the way these measures are calculated. The reconciliation
of these measure to net profit(loss) for the period is as follows:

**RISK FACTORS**

_You should carefully consider the risks described below as well as the other information contained in this offering_
_memorandum before making an investment decision. Any of the following risks may have a material adverse_
_effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and as a result you may lose all or_
_part of your original investment. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and_
_uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also have a material_
_adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows._

**Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry**

**_The cable television, broadband internet, DTH and telephony markets in the regions in which we operate are_**
**_highly competitive._**

We face significant competition in each of our product and service segments and may face competition from
new entrants in the future. The nature and level of the competition we face varies for each of the products and
services we offer and by region, but we generally compete on the basis of quality of content, network quality,
marketing, product and service portfolio specifications, customer care, sales and marketing services as well as
price. Our competitors include, but are not limited to, television providers, including providers using
alternative and emerging digital technologies such as Internet Protocol Television (“IPTV”) and OTT content
owners; DTH-TV providers; broadband internet and telephony services providers; public switched telephone
network (“PSTN”) or fiber connections; and in Slovenia, Bulgaria and Croatia, other MNOs, including those
using LTE technology. In addition, continued consolidation within the media industry may allow more
competitors to offer bundles of digital television, fixed-line telephony, mobile-telephony and broadband
services, and consolidation by competitors could allow them to benefit from economies of scale that we do
not have. As a result, we may compete against companies with easier access to financing, more comprehensive
product offerings, greater personnel resources, greater brand name recognition and experience or longer
established relationships with regulatory authorities and customers, resulting in fewer regulatory burdens
with which they are required to comply.

Communications technologies and consumer electronics, as well as the way information, communication and
entertainment is offered, are constantly changing, and the impact of such changes can be difficult to predict.
Current and future competitors may expand their product and service offering more rapidly or adapt to new
or emerging technologies more quickly than us (for example Telekom Srbija in Serbia and M:TEL in
Montenegro have quickly upgraded their GPON platforms), or may offer their products and services at a
lower price than ours, for example, where our services are priced at the high end of the market, which could
cause us to lose subscribers, force us to lower our prices or otherwise adversely affect the margin of profit we
are able to achieve from our services. In particular, we face the following risks in relation to each of our
product offerings:

**_Television_**

While competition among cable Pay-TV providers in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina is currently low due
to minimal cable overbuild, we face competition in the Serbian television market from other methods of
television services distribution, such as DTH and IPTV. Our main competitor in Serbia is the state-owned
incumbent Telekom Srbija. During 2018 and 2019, Telekom Srbija purchased several independent cable
operators, offering Pay-TV, telephony and internet services, as well as the DTH users of Polaris Media, a
Serbian DTH platform, strengthening Telekom Srbija’s presence in the Serbian market. Our main Pay-TV
competitor in Bosnia and Herzegovina is the incumbent in the ethnic region in which we operate, BH Telecom.
Competition in the Pay-TV market in Slovenia is strong, particularly for the provision of Fiber to the Home
(“FttH”) services between Telekom Slovenije and T2, especially in metropolitan areas. Our main competitors
in the Slovenian Pay-TV market are Telekom Slovenije, T2 and A1. Competition in Montenegro is strong, and
the primary competitors are Crnogorski Telekom (IPTV and Fiber to the × (“FTTx”)) and M:TEL (FTTx
and HFC). Both operators have a very large market share and a large number of users. Following the
completion of the Vivacom Acquisition, we also compete with A1 Bulgaria and Bulsatcom for offering
Pay-TV services in Bulgaria. Both of these competitors have larger market shares by number of subscribers
than Vivacom, which may make it difficult for us to build our Pay-TV subscriber base.

Additionally, we face increased competition from non-traditional television services based on new internet
technologies, including OTT television services, which have increased in number and quality over the past
few years. OTT television services deliver Pay-TV content “on top” of an existing broadband internet
connection directly to a television, PC, laptop, tablet or mobile devices. OTT service providers leverage existing


-----

infrastructures and are often not required to implement capital intensive models associated with traditional
data providers like us. We cannot rule out that increased availability of OTT content as well as advances in
broadband and mobile internet connection speeds will lead to increased competition from OTT providers in
the future.

**_Fixed Broadband Internet_**

Although we continue to hold stable market shares in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, we face strong
competition in these markets from other broadband internet services, such as ADSL and VDSL broadband
connections and FttH providers. Our main competitors for broadband internet services are Telekom Srbija in
Serbia and BH Telecom and Telecom RS in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In Bulgaria, we also compete with
A1 Bulgaria and Bulsatcom. Continued upgrades from DSL based broadband internet service to FttH, such
as the optical network that has been constructed in Serbia by Telekom Srbija, and more widespread FttH
installations could have a negative impact on our competitive position in the broadband internet market.

Due to extensive overbuild and high levels of broadband internet penetration in Slovenia, we face significant
competition in the broadband internet market segment from fiber broadband internet providers such as
Telekom Slovenije, T2 and A1. In particular, we compete against Telekom Slovenije’s optical network services.
Moreover, mobile operators are increasingly able to utilize a combination of powerful handsets and high
bandwidth technologies such as 5G and LTE technologies. Additional competition may come from satellite
technologies and operators that use microwave access (“WiMax”) technologies. In the Montenegrin
broadband internet market, Crnogorski Telekom utilizes FTTx, ADSL and VDSL broadband, and M:TEL
currently utilizes HFC, which will soon replace FTTx on its network.

**_Fixed-Line Telephony_**

In the liberalized Serbian and Bosnian telephony markets, we compete with the respective state-owned former
monopolies, Telekom Srbija in Serbia and BH Telecom and Telecom RS in Bosnia, which dominate the fixedline PSTN telephone market. We believe that the Slovenian telephony market is relatively mature and market
share changes are mainly driven by the combination of the price and quality of the services provided by
bundled offerings. Our main competitors in Slovenia are Telekom Slovenije, T2, and A1, and our main
competitors in Montenegro are the incumbent operator, Crnogorski Telekom, and M: Tel. In addition, in
Bulgaria, we compete in the fixed-line telephony market predominantly with A1 Bulgaria, which, in addition
to Vivacom, is the only other fully converged telecommunications operator in Bulgaria.

Further, we operate in an industry that is affected by fixed-line to mobile-telephony substitution, and as a
result there may be decreased demand for our fixed-line telephony services. We may be affected in each of the
markets in which we operate by providers of free Voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) services such as
Apple’s FaceTime service or WhatsApp which have considerably improved their speech quality over the last
few years and can be accessed from any device connected to the internet, including smartphones.

**_Mobile-Telephony_**

Following our acquisition of Tušmobil in April 2015, we began providing mobile-telephony services in
Slovenia as an MNO, and following completion of the Vivacom Acquisition and Tele2 Croatia Acquisition,
we began providing mobile-telephony services in Bulgaria and Croatia, respectively, as an MNO. Accordingly,
we face strong competition for subscribers from established competitors, including, in particular, Telekom
Slovenije and A1 Telekom Austria in Slovenia, A1 Bulgaria and Telenor in Bulgaria and Croatian Telecom,
A1 Croatia and T Mobile Croatia, as well as other mobile telecommunications that may enter the Slovenian,
Bulgarian or Croatian mobile markets (such as Hofer Telekom, which recently entered the Slovenian mobile
market). Certain competitors have undertaken or announced intentions to undertake acquisitions in the
mobile telecommunications markets in which we operate. PPF Group, a private investment group in Europe,
completed its acquisition of the telecommunications assets of Telenor Group in Serbia, Montenegro, Hungary
and Bulgaria in July 2018. Any other planned acquisitions by competitors, if consummated, could negatively
impact our business, such as by reducing our market share or forcing us to undertake more capital expenditure
or to lower prices.

To the extent we were to lose market share to any competitors, our revenues may decline. If we fail to increase
our market share in line with our expectations, we will be less profitable, which will adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations. In Bulgaria, the mobile market has stabilized as the
three main market participants are of roughly equal size and have all shifted to a value for money strategy,
which may hinder our ability to differentiate ourselves and our ability to grow our market share. Additionally,


-----

in each of the markets in which we compete, our competitors may improve their ability to attract new
subscribers, or provide their offerings or services at lower prices to increase their respective market shares,
which would make it more difficult for us to retain our current subscribers or expand our subscriber base
without us lowering our prices or increasing our subscriber retention cost. In order to compete, we may have
to lower prices, which may reduce our margins and/or increase our marketing and promotional expenses, each
of which may cause our operating profit to decline significantly.

**_Bundled Offerings_**

Customers of video and telecommunications services are increasingly expecting service providers to offer
high-quality bundles of television, broadband internet and telephony services. Many of our competitors,
including Telekom Slovenije in Slovenia, Telekom Srbija in Serbia, Telecom RS, HT Eronet and BH Telecom
in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Crnogorski Telekom and M:TEL in Montenegro, offer bundled packages of
services. Several of these bundles include mobile phone services, which we offer in Slovenia, Bulgaria and
Croatia. If our bundled products are not able to compete effectively in the markets in which we operate, our
business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

**_E-Commerce_**

In July 2020, we launched Shoppster, our regional e-commerce online-shopping platform, which is currently
available as an integrated online and TV shopping platform in Serbia and Slovenia. Shoppster’s key
competitors include, among others, e-commerce platforms such as E Kupi in Serbia and Mimovrste, EnaA,
Big Bang, Merkur and Piazz in Slovenia, as well as traditional retail stores such as Gigatron and Tehnomanija
in Serbia.

Increased competition, or any inability to provide cable and DTH Pay-TV, broadband internet and telephony
services at competitive prices, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and
financial condition.

**_Difficult economic conditions may reduce subscriber spending for our pay television, broadband internet, and_**
**_fixed-line and mobile-telephony services and reduce our rate of growth of subscriber additions._**

Our ability to grow or maintain our business may be adversely affected by weakening global or domestic
economic conditions, wavering consumer confidence and unemployment, including as a result of the ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic and the social distancing measures and other restrictions imposed in response by the
governments of each of the countries in which we operate. See “—Any outbreak of severe communicable
_diseases, including COVID-19, may materially affect our business and results of operations.” In addition, our_
ability to grow or maintain our business may be adversely affected by the impact of state implemented
austerity measures. For example, in 2014, the Serbian government implemented austerity measures, including
increased rates of taxation and a reduction in public sector wages, which if continued or adopted in our other
markets, could continue to have an impact on our customers’disposable income in Serbia or our other markets.
As customers may view spending for most of our services, such as Pay-TV, as discretionary, the risks associated
with certain segments of our business become more acute in periods of a slowing economy or recession as
consumers may delay purchasing decisions or reduce or reallocate their discretionary funds. Current customers
may elect to downgrade their packages or move to less costly providers, and new customers may opt to take
out our lower end broadband and Pay-TV packages rather than more expensive ones or may opt to become
customers of less costly competitors, or not to subscribe to Pay-TV services at all.

We are also exposed to risks associated with the potential financial instability of our customers, many of
whom may be adversely affected by a general economic downturn. This may lead to a higher number of
non-paying subscribers. Suppliers and distributors may also be more cautious in supplying goods to us and
may request additional credit enhancements or more restrictive payment terms. While the impact of an
economic slowdown on our business is difficult to predict, it could have a material adverse effect on our
revenues and our cash flow.

**_Our operating results will be adversely affected if we cannot generate strong advertising sales._**

We generate revenue from the sale of advertising on or in our television stations and broadcast and cable
networks. Expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions, as well as
budgeting and buying patterns. A decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general,
including as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the relevant responses taken by the governments
of the countries in which we operate, could alter current or prospective advertisers’ spending priorities as well


-----

as advertising pricing. See “—Any outbreak of severe communicable diseases, including COVID-19, may
_materially affect our business and results of operations.” For the three months ended March 31, 2021, our_
advertising sales increased by 182% as compared to the same period in 2020 mainly as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic’s impact in the same period in 2020. Demand for our products is also a factor in
determining advertising rates. For example, ratings points for our television stations and broadcast and cable
networks are factors that are weighed when determining advertising rates, and with respect to our television
stations and broadcast and television networks, when determining the affiliate rates received by us. In addition,
newer technologies, including new video formats, streaming and downloading capabilities via the internet,
video on demand, personal video recorders and other devices and technologies are increasing the number of
media and entertainment choices available to audiences. Some of these devices and technologies allow users
to view television or films from a remote location or on a time delayed basis and provide users the ability to
fast forward, rewind, pause and skip programming and advertisements. These technological developments
could affect the attractiveness of our offerings to viewers, advertisers and/or distributors. Failure to effectively
anticipate or adapt to emerging technologies or changes in consumer behavior could have an adverse effect on
our business. Furthermore, a decrease in advertising expenditures, reduced demand for our offerings or the
inability to obtain market ratings that adequately measure demand for our content on personal video recorders
and mobile devices could lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising revenue, which could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.

**_We have made and may make acquisitions or enter into transactions that may present unforeseen risks, and we_**
**_may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction and,_**
**_additionally, there are risks associated with the integration of any acquisitions._**

As part of our business strategy, we pursue strategic and opportunistic acquisitions of service providers,
content providers and cable assets. Any of these transactions could be material to our financial condition or
results of operations. Despite our successful track record, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue
making such acquisitions and our ability to acquire new businesses may be limited by many factors, including
availability of financing, debt covenants, complex ownership structures among potential targets and
government regulation and competition from other potential acquirers. In addition, our debt burden may
increase if we borrow funds to finance any future acquisition, which could have a negative impact on our cash
flows and our ability to finance our overall operations and make cash interest payments on the New Notes.

Even if we are successful in acquiring new businesses, the integration of such businesses, including the
integration of Vivacom, may prove to be more difficult than we initially anticipated and could create
unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Acquisitions pose certain risks, for example, difficulties or
delays in consolidating operations and achieving anticipated synergies, cost savings, revenues and cash flow
enhancements, growth, operational efficiencies and other benefits; diversion of managerial resources away
from our day-to-day business operations; potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities to the extent that
we issue new shares to fund an acquisition; and the assumption of unexpected liabilities and undisclosed
risks.

Following the Vivacom Acquisition, we expect to realize certain operational efficiency and cost saving
measures. We may not be able to realize these measures, either in the amount or within the timeframe that we
currently anticipate, and the costs of achieving these measures may be higher than what we expect. Our ability
to realize such operational efficiency and cost savings measures may be affected by a number of factors,
including increases in expenses related to the Vivacom Acquisition. In addition, the Vivacom Acquisition has
required, and will likely continue to require, substantial time and focus from management, which could
adversely affect their ability to operate our business. These factors may offset the expected cost savings from
the Vivacom Acquisition. In addition, the Vivacom Acquisition will result in a significant proportion of our
operations, assets and revenues deriving from Bulgaria. Bulgaria borders Serbia and North Macedonia, but it
has a different language, culture and history compared to the jurisdictions in which we currently operate. We
may encounter unexpected difficulties that could impact the successful integration of Vivacom in ways that
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Vivacom
and/or its subsidiaries may have liabilities that we failed or were unable to discover in the course of performing
due diligence investigations in connection with the Vivacom Acquisition.

In addition, the extent of liabilities we discovered in connection after the Vivacom Acquisition may be greater
than we expected. There may be unknown or contingent liabilities and issues relating to compliance with
applicable laws and regulations. For example, we could become liable for overdue payables of Vivacom and/or
its subsidiaries to suppliers and employees that are not currently known to us, or we could become subject to
tax or pension liabilities in respect of historical periods that we are not currently aware of or the amount of


-----

which we underestimated, or we could become liable in relation to past or pending disputes involving Vivacom
and/or its subsidiaries that are not currently known to us, or we could suffer losses relating to issues in title or
required permits for the real estate property owned and/or used by Vivacom and/or its subsidiaries that are
not currently known to us. In conducting our due diligence, we were required to rely on resources available to
us, including public information, information provided by the seller and third-party consultants and advisers.
There can be no assurance that the due diligence we undertook has revealed or highlighted all relevant facts
necessary or helpful in evaluating the Vivacom Acquisition. Any such unknown or previously underestimated
liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the New Notes.

The Forthnet Acquisition and the integration of Forthnet also involves certain significant risks, in particular
since Forthnet, as a MVNO that in general relies on other providers’ networks, is subject to significant
regulatory and competitive risks that could impact the results of operations and financial condition of
Forthnet and, therefore, our Group. Similarly, the Optima Telekom Acquisition and the integration of Optima
Telekom involves certain significant risks. In particular, completion of the Optima Telekom Acquisition is
subject to various conditions, including the implementation of certain changes in the current Croatian
telecommunication legislation relating to vertical integration between pay-TV broadcasters and distributors.
There can be no assurance that these legislative changes will be implemented by the Croatian and therefore we
may not be able to complete the Optima Telekom Acquisition by the end of 2021 as currently expected or at
all.

Furthermore, certain contracts of the businesses acquired by us contain “change of control” provisions that
require the acquired company to notify the counterparty of a potential change of control, or contain language
that could be interpreted as allowing, subject to certain conditions, the counterparty to terminate the contract
following a change of control. In particular, the Vivacom Acquisition constitutes a change of control under
certain agreements entered into by Vivacom and its subsidiaries, such as commercial agreements with some of
its suppliers, and entitles these third parties to terminate their agreements with Vivacom or, in some cases,
request adjustments of the terms of the agreements. Nova BG and Optima Telekom are also party to certain
agreements with international television content providers which contain change of control clauses. The
Optima Telekom Acquisition may also constitute a change of control under certain agreements. Although the
agreements governing certain of our acquisitions require the target to use commercially reasonable endeavors
to obtain consents or waivers relating to such “change of control” provisions prior to closing of the
acquisitions, such consents and waivers are generally not a condition to closing. If a substantial number of
these contracts have been, are or will be terminated as a result of our acquisition, we may be forced to enter
into new contracts on less favorable terms, or we may be unable to secure replacements.

While we strive to mitigate unexpected liabilities and risks though contractual protections in our acquisition
documentation, we cannot ensure that such protections will be effective. For example, although the share sale
and purchase agreement pursuant to which we acquired Tušmobil contains warranties related to, among
other things, compliance with laws, licenses and consents and financial crime, and provides, subject to certain
qualifications and limitations, for indemnification from the seller in the event of breach of warranties, we
cannot guarantee that we will be successful in any claims that we may bring for breach of warranties based on
the agreement or that any recovery made under this agreement would cover the potential losses arising out of
any such breach. If we enter into an acquisition agreement, but the acquisition is not consummated, we may
be liable for break-up fees or other payments, which may, in some cases, be material.

The agreement with respect to the Nova TV Croatia Acquisition does not provide us an indemnity in the
event of potential remedies related to any ongoing litigation and investigations resulting from the completion
of such acquisition. In connection with the Direct Media/Pink Acquisition, Ascanius Netherlands B.V. has
given certain indemnities and customary representations and warranties. In connection with the Nova TV
Croatia Acquisition, CME B.V. has given certain customary representations and warranties related to Nova
TV Croatia. The Vivacom Acquisition Agreement, the Tele2 Croatia Acquisition Agreement and the
agreements for the Forthnet Acquisition, the Nova Broadcasting Group Acquisition and the Optima Telekom
Acquisition also contain certain indemnities and customary representations and warranties. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to enforce any claims relating to breaches of such representations and warranties,
and CME B.V.’s liability, in respect of the Nova TV Croatia Acquisition, the Vivacom Seller’s liability, with
respect to the Vivacom Acquisition, and Tele2 Sverige AB’s liability, with respect to the Tele2 Croatia
Acquisition, and the respective sellers for the Forthnet Acquisition, the Nova Broadcasting Group Acquisition
and the Optima Telekom Acquisition, with respect to breaches of their representations and warranties, is
limited.


-----

**_Any acquisition we undertake or have undertaken may be subject to regulatory approval or review by competition_**
**_authorities which could delay, limit or prevent its completion or could prevent us from realizing the benefits_**
**_from any such acquisition following its completion._**

Acquisitions we undertake may require the approval of governmental authorities (at both national and
European levels), which can block, impose conditions on, or delay the process which could result in a failure
on our part to proceed with announced transactions on a timely basis or at all. Past acquisitions by the
Group, including recent acquisitions, are or may become subject to review by competition authorities within
the relevant jurisdictions. Such competition authorities may take the position that merger control filings were
required, and should we fail to meet such requests or requirements in a timely manner, the relevant
governmental authority may impose fines and, if in connection with a merger transaction, may require
corrective measures, such as mandatory disposition of assets or divestiture of operations.

For example, in the past, relevant competition authorities in Serbia and Slovenia have challenged a number of
our acquisitions, in some cases resulting in a requirement of divestiture or the levying of fines, which can be
substantial. See “Our Business—Legal Proceedings.” The completion of the Optima Telekom Acquisition is
subject to a condition relating to the implementation of certain changes in current Croatian
telecommunication legislation.

We also may be subject to challenges brought by certain of our competitors. For example, on April 29, 2021,
Vivacom acquired local broadband and television operators Net 1 EOOD, ComNet Sofia EAD and Digital
Cable Television EOOD. These transactions were approved by the Bulgarian Commission on Protection of
Competition (“CPC”). On April 29, 2021, however, Telenor Bulgaria challenged the CPC’s approval relating
to these transactions before the Administrative Court—Sofia District. Vivacom has intervened in support of
the CPC’s decision. If the Administrative Court—Sofia District annuls the CPC’s approvals, and the
annulment is upheld by the Supreme Administrative Court, the CPC will re-examine the transactions (which
have already been completed).

Any risks associated with acquisitions or future acquisitions could have a significant negative impact on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Acceptance of our content, particularly our television programming, by the public is difficult to predict, which_**
**_could lead to fluctuations in revenues._**

Television production and distribution are uncertain businesses since the revenues derived from the production
and distribution of a television series depend primarily upon its acceptance by the public, which is difficult to
predict. The commercial success of a television program also depends upon the quality and acceptance of
other competing television programming released into the marketplace at or near the same time, the
availability of a growing number of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities, general
economic conditions and their effects on consumer spending and other tangible and intangible factors, all of
which can change and cannot be predicted with certainty. Audience ratings for a television program are
generally a key factor in generating revenues from other distribution channels, such as content licensing.
Given the production costs that are incurred prior to airing a new television program, the profitability of
television production and the recovery of upfront costs depend on the program’s popularity upon and
following the initial airing. A decline in the ratings or popularity of our entertainment, sports or news
television programming, which could be a result of the loss of talent or rights to certain programming, could
adversely affect advertising revenues in the near term and, over a longer period of time, adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We do not have guaranteed access to all of our television content and are dependent on our agreements,_**
**_relationships and cooperation with content owners, including broadcasters and collective rights associations._**

The success of our business depends on, among other things, the quality and variety of the television content
delivered to our customers. We depend on our agreements, relationships and cooperation with third parties
for the majority of our content. We receive content for our cable and DTH Pay-TV services pursuant to
licenses with content owners, including high-quality regional and international television networks such as
FOX, ViaSat and Universal channels. Additionally, we produce our own content through our in-house content
company.

While we intend to negotiate additional access to continue to expand our Pay-TV product range, rights to
premium or high definition (“HD”) content may in the future be obtained by our competitors on an exclusive
basis and therefore not be available to us. Additionally, we may be unable to secure content on an exclusive


-----

basis and may have to share broadcasting rights with our competitors, which could lead to a dilution of our
brand name. Furthermore, our competitors may be able to secure content which is more popular than ours,
and changes in our subscribers’content preferences could result in a decrease of the popularity of our content
and an increase in the popularity of that of our competitors. While we have successfully developed our video
on demand and other interactive services as well as our own television content in the past, our ability to
source content will be increasingly important and will depend on our ability to maintain relationships and
cooperation with content owners and broadcasters for both standard and HD content as well as our ability to
accurately predict our customers’ content preferences. Furthermore, our NetTV Plus OTT content platform,
which distributes local ethnic content to former Yugoslav expats around the world, relies on the availability of
a number of local free-to-air channels and no fee contracts for the distribution of such content. In the past, we
have faced difficulties obtaining such local content free of charge or negotiating contracts with local TV
channel providers on satisfactory terms, which difficulties have in the past led to the removal of some of these
channels. Additionally, from time to time, we face disputes over the rights to certain of the OTT content that
we show. If we fail to produce, obtain or retain on satisfactory terms sufficient popular and quality
programming for our digital cable and DTH services, or local content for our OTT content platform; if the
content we provide is only popular for a short period of time; if our competitors secure content that is more
popular than ours; or if the popularity of our content declines, our ability to attract customers from
competitors to our services, retain current customers, compete effectively with free TV channel providers or
recoup our content production costs may be limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

Additionally, as we depend upon such content owners for the provision of content to attract and retain
customers, content owners may have considerable power to renegotiate the license fees we pay them. Most
license agreements are renewed on a regular basis, typically every three years. We may be unable to renew such
contracts on terms that are similar to those of the current agreements, which could result in an increase in our
content costs or, if we are unable to agree on the terms of service, the cancellation of such license contracts.
The loss of certain content could, in turn, affect our customer base. Difficulties encountered with content
suppliers may result in disruptions in our operations, loss of profitability and damage to our reputation,
financial condition or results of operations.

**_Any failure to keep pace with technological changes and evolving industry standards could harm our competitive_**
**_position and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business._**

The broadband internet, television and fixed-line and mobile-telephony services sectors are characterized by
rapid and significant changes in technology. We will need to anticipate and react to these changes and develop
successful new and enhanced products and services quickly enough to adapt to the changing market. This
could result in the need to make substantial investments in new or enhanced technologies, products or services,
and we may not be able to adopt such technology due to insufficient capital or for other reasons, such as
incompatibilities with our systems. In addition, new technologies, such as 5G or 3D TV, will or may become
dominant in the future, rendering our current technologies and systems obsolete.

In particular, we expect certain communications technologies that are currently under development or have
recently been introduced, namely 5G in the future and 4G LTE currently, which allow for faster data
transmission and lower unit cost per gigabyte transferred traffic compared to 3G, to become increasingly
important in our market. We currently hold a 4G license in Slovenia and in April 2021 acquired licenses for
5G spectrum frequencies in Slovenia. Vivacom holds a 4G license in Bulgaria and in May 2021, secured a
license for 5G spectrum frequencies in Bulgaria after announcing the commercial launch of its 5G network in
September 2020. Telemach Croatia holds a 4G license in Croatia and is participating in an auction for 5G
spectrum frequencies in Croatia. However, if we are unable to effectively compete in the 4G market or keep
pace with technological developments (particularly the development of our 5G network at a pace comparable
to that of our competitors and acquire new frequencies) and invest significantly in 5G technologies, or if we
are not successful in the Croatian auction for 5G spectrum frequencies, including the auction in respect of the
Croatian mobile market, we could lose subscribers or fail to attract new subscribers, which would impact
subscriber churn, or incur substantial costs and investments in order to maintain our subscriber base, all of
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The availability of any new features developed for use in our industry can have a significant impact on a
subscriber’s initial decision to choose our or a competitor’s products. We may not be able to develop or partner
with third-party suppliers to gain access to technical advances before our competitors, match technological
innovations by our competitors or design systems that meet subscribers’requirements. Our ability to effectively
anticipate and adapt successfully to changes in technology in our industry and provide new or enhanced


-----

services in a timely and cost-effective manner, or successfully anticipate the demands of our subscribers, will
determine whether we will be able to increase or maintain our subscriber and revenue base. As a result, new or
enhanced technologies, services or offerings we introduce may fail to achieve sufficient market acceptance or
experience technical difficulties. For example, we do not expect that previously installed internet modems or
set-top boxes will be able to support all of the enhancements we may introduce to our broadband internet and
television services over time. If we fail to respond adequately to technological changes, we could lose
subscribers and experience a decrease in revenues and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results
of operations would be materially and adversely affected.

Additionally, the cost of implementing emerging and new technologies could be significant and we may fail to
obtain the necessary financing. If we are unable to obtain such financing at attractive terms or at all, we might
not be able to make the necessary technological changes or upgrades and our business, financial condition
and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

**_We are subject to significant government regulation and supervision, as a result of which we may be affected by_**
**_unforeseen changes in regulation and government policy which may increase our costs and otherwise adversely_**
**_affect our business._**

We are subject to significant governmental regulation and supervision. See “Our Business—Regulatory
_Framework.”_

Changes in laws, regulations or governmental policy affecting our activities and those of our competitors
could significantly influence how we operate our business, our ability to offer certain products and services
and our ability to introduce new products and services. In particular, regulatory changes relating to our
activities and those of our competitors, such as changes relating to third-party access to cable networks, the
costs of interconnection with other networks or the prices of competing products and services, or any change
in policy allowing more favorable conditions for other operators, could adversely affect our ability to set
prices, enter new markets or control our costs. In Serbia, we are the subject of various pending regulatory
actions, including from the Serbian Tax Authority and RATEL. See “Our Business—Legal Proceedings.”

In addition, any change in existing laws, regulations or governmental policies and/or the implementation of
any new law, regulation, including sanction regimes, or governmental policy, both at a national or international
level, on certain communication technologies that are currently under development or have recently been
introduced, namely 5G, in the countries in which we operate, may result in increased costs and logistical
complexity for us. For example, the U.S., the UK, Sweden, Poland and Romania have banned technology
from Huawei, a Chinese telecommunications company, from being used in the development of their 5G
networks, which in the UK is expected to delay the development of its 5G network and has compelled UK
telecommunications companies to seek alternative suppliers. We have entered into a global frame agreement
with Huawei in respect of mobile radio network equipment. For more information, see “Our Business—
_Network—Mobile—Mobile Network Evolution—Mobile Radio Network Equipment Agreement.” If a similar_
ban is imposed in Slovenia, Bulgaria Croatia or Greece, or if otherwise obtaining or using Huawei technology
is restricted by the governments of the countries in which we operate, this may result in us having to find
alternative suppliers for 5G network equipment, which may increase costs for us to develop and maintain our
networks and which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Our ability to introduce new products and services may also be affected if we cannot predict how existing or
future laws, regulations or policies would apply to such products or services. In addition, our business and the
industry in which we operate are subject to investigation by regulators, which could lead to enforcement
actions, fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages. Any such action could
harm our reputation and result in increased costs to the business.

**_We are exposed to currency exchange fluctuation and currency instability risks in Europe that could have an_**
**_adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition and cash flows._**

The reporting currency of our business is the euro. While Slovenia and Montenegro use the euro as the official
currency, and while the value of the Bosnian mark and Bulgarian lev are pegged to the euro, we collect
subscriber fees in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, North Macedonia and Bulgaria in local
currencies. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the three months ended March 31, 2020 and the year
ended December 31, 2020, we generated 28%, 48% and 42% of our revenues in Serbian dinar and Croatian
kuna. At the same time, the vast majority of our costs to operate our business as well as our capital expenditure
are paid in euros. The Serbian dinar has fluctuated in the past (including through inflation), and may fluctuate


-----

in the future, resulting in significant and unpredictable foreign exchange losses and gains. Additionally,
although the Croatian Kuna has been relatively stable in the past, given our increased exposure following the
consummation of the Tele2 Croatia Acquisition, any fluctuations could affect our results of operations, as
with the fluctuations of the Serbian Dinar in the past. If the euro appreciated in value against the Serbian
dinar, the Bulgarian lev, the Croatian kuna (which will be replaced by the euro on January 1, 2023) or other
local currencies, and we are unable to pass through increased costs to our customers or if we are unable to
exchange the various local currencies into euros at all, our revenue would decrease which would make it more
difficult to generate the cash necessary to continue our operations without disruptions, cover our costs and
meet our capital expenditure requirements.

Additionally, economic events in recent years affecting European economies have raised a number of questions
regarding the stability and overall standing of the European Monetary Union. Credit risk in these countries
and in other Eurozone countries, especially in Slovenia, could have a negative impact on our business.
Concerns also remain regarding the overall stability and suitability of the euro as a single currency given the
diverse economic and political circumstances in individual states which use the euro. The departure or risk of
departure from the euro by one or more Eurozone countries or the abandonment of the euro as a currency, or
the reintroduction of an individual currency in Slovenia, as well as the de pegging of the Bosnian mark or the
Bulgarian lev from the euro, could have major negative effects on our existing contractual relations with our
customers, and could adversely affect the economy in Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Bulgaria,
respectively. In particular, the departure of Slovenia from the euro would increase our exposure to changes in
currency rates. Any of these developments could affect our ability to refinance our liabilities and have a
significant negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Any outbreak of severe communicable diseases, including COVID-19, may materially affect our business and_**
**_results of operations._**

Significant outbreaks of contagious diseases, including the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic or other
illnesses, may result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial
markets of many countries, leading to substantial declines in consumer purchasing power and resulting in an
economic downturn that could affect demand for our products and services, our ability to collect against
existing trade receivables and our operating results. In particular, in response to the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic, during 2020 and the first half of 2021, governments of the countries in which we conduct our
operations implemented several measures, including travel restrictions, lockdowns, quarantines and other
social distancing measures, which have had a material adverse impact on the overall economies of such
countries and, as a result, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, in particular, our
revenues generated from advertising, media selling, mobile handsets sales and our mobile international
roaming revenues as well as on our ARPUs. For example, from March 2020 until May 2020 and again in
October 2020, the Netherlands adopted several social distancing and other restrictive measures, particularly
with respect to access to restaurants, shopping centers and other commercial facilities, aimed at mitigating the
negative consequences of the pandemic. In compliance with these restrictive measures, during the governmentimposed lockdowns we closed substantially all of our facilities in all of our countries of operation, while
maintaining a limited number of employees in business critical functions on-site to operate our data centers
and transitioned all of our remaining employees to remote working. As the governments of the countries in
which we operate attempt to implement economic recovery measures while managing a resurgence in new
infections, significant restrictions and social distancing measures remain in place or may be re imposed, which
continue to adversely affect the economies of the countries in which we operate and, in turn, our operations.
If a significant portion of our workforce is unable to work effectively due to prolonged illness, quarantines,
shelter in place arrangements, government actions, facility closures or other reasons in connection with the
COVID-19 pandemic, our operations could be materially impacted. We may be unable to perform fully on
our contracts and carry out new sales activity, and some of our costs may not be fully recoverable or
adequately covered by insurance.

In addition, as a result of social distancing measures and restrictions imposed in response to the COVID-19
pandemic, our customers may not be able to operate their businesses for a prolonged and indeterminate
period of time, which, if realized, will likely impact our operations. Moreover, it is possible that the continued
spread of COVID-19, further waves of infection, or a renewed or extended lockdown in one or more of the
countries in which we operate, if realized, will cause further disruption in our business operations, cause delay,
or limit the ability of, our customers to perform under their existing contracts, including making timely
payments to us, and cause other unpredictable events. Customers may experience significant losses due to the
COVID-19 outbreak and may terminate their existing contracts or postpone or ultimately cancel future
planned orders and contracts due to those losses. Both domestic and international travel may be further


-----

restricted to certain areas which may limit our ability to obtain new customers and enter new markets, to
provide services in the areas in which our customers are currently located or otherwise conduct our operations
as we have done in the past.

To the extent our activities are disrupted by restrictions imposed by governments or other authorities to
address the risk of transmission of COVID-19, or by changes in customer behavior, this may result in a loss of
customers, and our future rate of growth may slow compared to our past growth rates. The general economic
impact of COVID-19 restrictions on the communities that we serve may result in customers not being able to
continue to pay for our services or deciding to postpone, cancel or reduce their existing subscriptions. This
could result in an increase in bad debts and cancellations, as well as a reduction or delay in revenue collection,
which could negatively impact our liquidity, cash flow, profitability and attrition rate. In addition, social
distancing measures resulting in the cancellation or postponement of certain sporting events have had and
may continue to have an adverse impact on the results of our Media Group segment. In particular, as a result
of such measures revenues generated from our Media Group segment, excluding the impact of revenues
generated by NOVA BG, decreased by 11% in the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to the same
period in 2020, due to the strategic decision to provide exclusive sport and other content to United Group
companies which led to the non-prolongation of carriage deals with certain pay-TV providers in Serbia and
Bosnia and Herzegovina. The disruptions triggered by COVID-19 in countries where our suppliers and
customers are located, may result in a slowdown of their production activities and other disruptions, any of
which could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition,
in some of the jurisdictions in which we operate we have received certain state supported aid which we may be
obliged to return if certain conditions are met, potentially together with interest in arrears from the day of the
receipt of the relevant aid.

In addition, political repercussions of responses to the COVID-19 outbreak by European Union institutions
as well as by other countries in the European Union could have complex and hard to predict consequences for
the future, including a destabilization of the European Union or its institutions or a slow down or reversal of
European integration. It is unclear whether measures taken by European Union institutions, the governments
of the countries in which we operate to contain the COVID-19 outbreak are adequate and will be effective in
achieving their goals. It is unclear when, if at all, the COVID-19 outbreak will be contained. We cannot
guarantee that COVID-19 or any future outbreak of another virus or other contagious disease will not have a
material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic
negatively affects our business, results of operations and financial condition depends on several factors, such
as the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, any additional periods of lockdown in the countries
in which our customers are located, and the pace at which demand, pricing and, in general, economic and
operating conditions will stabilize and recover in the countries where we operate. Any future developments
are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions
taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic. To the extent the
COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operation, financial condition and prospects,
as well as our ability to perform our obligations under the New Notes, it may also have the effect of heightening
many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section.

**_Legal, political and economic uncertainty in the Eurozone, including the exit of the United Kingdom from the_**
**_European Union and the European sovereign debt crisis, may adversely impact current trading arrangements, be_**
**_a source of instability in international markets and create significant currency fluctuations, which could have_**
**_a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition._**

The United Kingdom (“UK”) held a referendum on June 23, 2016, to determine whether the UK should leave
the EU or remain as a Member State, and the outcome of that referendum was in favor of leaving the EU.
While the EU and the UK agreed a comprehensive, zero- tariff, zero-quota free trade agreement on
December 24, 2020, which was ratified by the UK parliament on December 30, 2020 and came into force on
January 1, 2021, the end of the transition period has led to increased customs, health and safety checks at the
border, which could delay or disrupt the movement of goods between the EU and the UK, undermine bilateral
cooperation in key policy areas, significantly disrupt trade between the UK and the EU and cause political
and economic instability in other countries of the EU. Additionally, the UK has ceased to be a member of the
EU single market, which has ended the free movement of services and workers between the UK and the EU
and may make it more difficult for our UK operations to do business with customers or suppliers that are
based in the EU. The impact of the UK-EU trade agreement and the resulting effects on the political and
economic future of the UK remain uncertain. Economic instability and uncertainty in Europe, has and may
continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.


-----

Due to the size and importance of the UK economy, the uncertainty and unpredictability concerning the
UK’s legal, political and economic relationship with Europe may continue to be a source of instability in the
international markets, create significant currency fluctuations, and/or otherwise adversely affect trading
agreements or similar cross border cooperation arrangements (whether economic, tax, fiscal, legal, regulatory
or otherwise) for the foreseeable future. It is also possible that the exit of the UK from the EU will lead other
EU Member States to consider leaving the EU, which could be an additional source of instability in the
international markets. Further, other EU Member States within the Eurozone could decide to discontinue
their use of the euro as their functional currency. The exit of the UK (or the possible exit of any other country)
from the EU, the potential withdrawal of Scotland from the UK, or prolonged periods of uncertainty relating
to any of these possibilities, could result in significant macroeconomic deterioration, including, but not limited
to, further decreases in global stock exchange indices, increased foreign exchange volatility (in particular a
further weakening of the pound sterling and euro against other leading currencies), and decreased GDP in the
EU or other markets in which we operate. In addition, there are increasing concerns that these events could
push the UK or Eurozone into an economic recession and/or worsen the economic recession caused by the
global COVID-19 pandemic, any of which, were they to occur, would further destabilize the global financial
markets.

Our operations are also subject to risks from high levels of sovereign debt in certain European countries,
which combined with weak economic growth and high unemployment, could lead to fiscal reforms (including
austerity measures), sovereign debt restructurings, higher levels of volatility and potential disruptions in the
credit and equity markets, in particular as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. With regard to
currency instability issues, concerns exist in the Eurozone with respect to individual macro fundamentals on a
country by country basis, as well as with respect to the overall stability of the European Monetary Union and
the suitability of a single currency to appropriately deal with specific fiscal management and sovereign debt
issues in individual Eurozone countries. The realization of these concerns could lead to the exit of one or
more countries from the European Monetary Union and the re-introduction of individual currencies in these
countries or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the European Monetary Union
entirely. The capital market disruption that would likely accompany any such event could have a material
adverse impact on our liquidity and financial condition. Furthermore, any redenomination event would likely
be accompanied by significant economic dislocation, particularly within the Eurozone countries, which in
turn could have an adverse impact on demand for our products, and accordingly, on our revenue and cash
flows. As we generate revenue in a number of different currencies, including the euro, Serbian dinar, Bosnian
mark, Bulgarian lev and Croatian kuna, increased currency fluctuation could have a material adverse impact
on our results of operations. See “—We are exposed to currency exchange fluctuation and currency instability
_risks in Europe that could have an adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition and cash flows.”_

For these reasons, legal, political and economic uncertainty in the Eurozone could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our operations in some markets are constrained by political factors and our business might be affected by_**
**_factors or changes in the political, judicial, economic or security environment in the countries in which we operate._**

We currently operate in countries across Southeastern Europe and the governments of these countries differ
with respect to structure, stability and level of regulation. As some of our operations, such as network
expansions and construction or acquisition of cable assets, depend on governmental approval and regulatory
decisions, we may make decisions influenced by political considerations rather than fully exploiting our
contractual or legal rights, in order to avoid negatively affecting our relationship with national, regional or
local authorities, including regulators. Additionally, the respective governments in our core markets currently
own a majority stake in our biggest competitors in those markets: Telekom Slovenije in Slovenia, Telekom
Srbija in Serbia and BH Telecom and HT Eronet in Bosnia and Herzegovina. As a result of this, our
competitors may have special privileges with regulatory authorities or receive other forms of governmental
support. Accordingly, our operations may be constrained by the relevant political environment and may be
adversely affected by such constraints.

Each of the countries in which we operate has a short legislative, judicial and administrative history and it is
not possible to predict with certainty the effect of current and future legislation on our business. Company,
commercial, contract, customs, currency, property, banking, bankruptcy, competition, securities, labor, tax
and other laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate (including those concerning privatization
and the compensation of former owners) are still developing and continue to be substantially revised. There is
little precedent for how these laws and regulations will be interpreted or implemented either by the courts or
government agencies. Existing and future laws and regulations may be applied inconsistently. For example, in


-----

Bulgaria, the regulatory practices of the Bulgarian Commission for Protection of Competition and the
Bulgarian Communications Regulation Commission is not always concerted which can cause conflicting
decisions in the regulation of electronic communications. These factors could result in market uncertainty,
lack of clear criteria and in many cases could lead to excessive regulation. In the jurisdictions in which we
operate, we may experience difficulties or delays in obtaining permits or other governmental authorizations.

Additionally, in certain countries in which we operate, political, security and economic changes may result in
political and regulatory uncertainty and civil unrest. In Bulgaria, for example, protests against alleged
government corruption began in July 2020, resulting in large demonstrations in Sofia, Varna, Plovdiv and
other areas of the country. Protestors demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Boyko Borissov and the
state chief prosecutor. Although the protests ceased at the beginning of November 2020, an election held in
April 2021 resulted in no party being able or willing to form a government, and snap parliamentary elections
were held on July 11, 2021. The results of the new elections were similar to those held in April 2021
and therefore there is uncertainty on whether a government will be formed. The uncertainty around the
stability of the Bulgarian government could have a material adverse effect on our development in the
country, including our plans for building our mobile network and growing our customer base. Furthermore,
the majority of countries in which we operate are emerging economies and as such are more susceptible to
adverse global economic trends and higher inflationary pressure, which could have a negative effect on the
growth of our business or operations, increase our operating costs or decrease consumer demand and spending
power.

Additionally, the judicial systems of certain of the countries in which we operate may not be fully independent
of social, economic and political forces, and many courts in these countries experience a high volume of case
backlogs. This often results in inconsistent judicial interpretation of laws and regulations and excessive delays
in court proceedings. Relatedly, certain market participants in the countries in which we operate may conduct
their operations without regard for applicable laws or regulations, which creates competitive disadvantages
for other participants. In Bulgaria, for example, it is not uncommon for certain TV operators to use content
illegally without contracts with the content owners or to underreport the number of their subscribers or for
certain broadband operators to provide internet access with cable networks constructed in non-compliance
with Bulgarian regulations. As a result of the foregoing, we may operate with competitive disadvantages or
may not be able to enforce our legal rights efficiently or successfully, including title to our intellectual property,
under the laws of the countries in which we operate. Each of these factors could, individually or in the
aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial conditions or result of
operations.

**_We do not hold valid use permits for parts of our cable network and we are dependent on leases for certain_**
**_parts of our network in various countries in which we operate._**

**_Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro_**

We currently do not hold use permits for a portion of our network in Serbia. Given that a cadaster of lines has
just recently begun to function and we are still taking steps to proceed with our registration of the network in
the cadaster, the legal status of our cable infrastructure can only be established by reviewing the documents
pertaining to the construction of our network, including the construction and use permit. As a result, we may
face difficulties establishing conclusive ownership of a portion of our cable network in the future. While
current market practice allows us the continued use of our entire cable network despite not holding adequate
use permits, we cannot guarantee that this practice will continue to remain in effect. In addition, certain
construction and use permits in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro, may be incomplete or deficient.

**_Bulgaria_**

Vivacom’s mobile network in Bulgaria is supported by numerous base station transmission systems (“BTS”).
Given the regulations that govern such equipment and the various permits required to operate Vivacom’s
BTS, we cannot be certain that Vivacom’s right to use a portion of its BTS will not be challenged. While we do
not generally believe that the lack of any single permit or approval with respect to our BTS would have a
material adverse effect on Vivacom’s network, the prohibition of the use of a material number of BTS or any
strategically located BTS that cannot be easily replaced by a competent authority could have a disruptive
effect on our transmission to certain areas, which could result in a material adverse effect on Vivacom’s
business.


-----

**_Croatia_**

While Telemach Croatia has title to use its communication network in Croatia, due to different construction
related regimes changing over time, we cannot confirm that Telemach Croatia holds valid use permits for
parts of its communication network. Although current market practice allows the continued use of the entire
network despite not holding adequate permits for each site, we cannot guarantee that this practice will
continue. Should existing requirements to hold such permits be more strictly enforced in the future, and
should we be unable to obtain such permits, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
flow might be negatively affected.

**_Slovenia_**

Mainly due to different approaches to building our communication networks and numerous takeovers of
local operators in the past, we may not currently have title to use certain parts of our communication network
in Slovenia. While the current market practice allows us the continued use of our entire communications
network in Slovenia despite this, we cannot guarantee that this practice will continue to remain in effect, and
we may incur additional costs in respect of obtaining (or failing to obtain) title to use every part of our
communication network.

Furthermore, a portion of our communication network in Slovenia is not registered in the Slovenian Public
Utilities Cadastre. While we are taking actions to make all appropriate registration, it cannot be excluded that,
among other things, a fine ranging from €50 thousand to €400 thousand could be imposed on us for failure to
register.

**_Greece_**

In Greece, Forthnet rents part of its network from OTE, and has signed an MVNO contract with Vodafone.
This is subject to certain regulatory risks, including limits on retail prices imposed by the Greek government.

**_Lease Agreements_**

In addition, we depend on lease agreements for some parts of our communication network in Slovenia,
Croatia, Serbia and Greece, as well as on national roaming agreements for parts of our communication
network in some of the countries in which we operate, and we may be exposed to increase in costs associated
with and termination of such agreements. For example, in 2018 we experienced an increase in the rent we pay
for utility poles from the Serbian Electricity Utility Company from between €10 and €12.2 to between €20 and
€25 per pole per year.

Any of the above risks, if realized, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,
financial condition or prospects.

**_We may not realize any or all of the adjustments to Last Two Quarter Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA included in_**
**_this offering memorandum._**

This offering memorandum presents pro forma adjusted financial data which includes various assumptions.
See “ Summary of Company and Group Run-Rate, Vivacom, Unaudited Pro Forma and Certain Other Financial
_Data” for additional details regarding these pro forma adjustments to UG EBITDA and their underlying_
assumptions. These assumptions are based on our current estimates, and they involve risks, uncertainties,
assumptions and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially
different from any anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such
pro forma adjusted financial data. This offering memorandum presents estimated UG EBITDA figures that
result from certain assumptions and adjustments that we have made for Forthnet, Nova BG, Optima Telekom
(which acquisition is expected to be completed by the end of 2021), as well as for a number of smaller
acquisitions, that are derived from the management accounts of the respective targets and that include certain
assumptions and adjustments. The pro forma adjustments to UG EBITDA include adjustments for
annualized cost savings related to overhead costs, production costs and multiplex costs, accounting
adjustments due to differences between our accounting policies and the accounting policies of the acquired
companies, and adjustments for the annualized effect of price increases. Some of the factors that could cause
our future financial performance to differ materially from that expressed or implied by such pro forma
adjusted financial data include: not achieving the level of EBITDA and/or the level of cost savings that we
expect, failing to achieve our anticipated level of subscriber growth, changes in the accounting principles or
policies that are applied, lower than anticipated prices for our services or if the relevant acquisitions are


-----

delayed or not completed in whole or in part. If any of these factors or others cause our actual financial
performance to differ significantly from that implied by the pro forma financial data presented, they could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.

**_If we fail to implement and maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may be unable to accurately_**
**_or timely report our results of operations, and the trading price and liquidity of the New Notes could be negatively_**
**_impacted thereby._**

Our internal controls over financial reporting are intended to ensure we maintain accurate records, promote
the accurate and timely reporting of our financial information, maintain adequate control over our assets,
and detect unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets. Effective internal and disclosure controls
are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to operate successfully as a business. Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls.

In recent years, we have significantly expanded the size and scope of our operations, including through
acquisitions in new geographical jurisdictions and in new areas of business, and we intend to continue such
growth. As we expand the size and scope of our Group, there is an increased risk that our internal controls
may not mature at the same pace. For example, some of the processes related to internal controls may be new
for personnel in certain newly acquired subsidiaries or newly entered jurisdictions in our structure, and in the
case of acquisitions, may take time to be fully implemented. Furthermore, maintenance of internal controls
may become more difficult as certain of the entities we have acquired or may acquire may prepare their
financial statements in accordance with local accounting rules rather than IFRS. As we grow, the required
sophistication of our internal controls and accounting and financial reporting functions will also need to
expand to ensure our internal controls remain adequate. Moreover, recently adopted and complex accounting
standards and interpretations, such as IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and IFRS 16, the amendments to IFRS 2 and
IFRIC 23, have created new and more demanding requirements for financial reporting and disclosures, which
require further development of our internal controls.

In prior years, our auditors auditing our financial statements under International Standards on Auditing
identified certain significant deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting. A significant
deficiency in internal control, as defined under International Standards on Auditing, is a deficiency or
combination of deficiencies in internal control that, in an independent auditors’ professional judgment, is of
sufficient importance to merit the attention of those charged with governance. This definition differs from the
definition that would be applied if an audit was conducted with standards applicable in the United States. The
significant deficiencies identified related to deficiencies in the size of our accounting and financial reporting
functions, deficiencies in the number of qualified personnel with IFRS accounting experience employed in
those functions, deficiencies in controls to ensure that all significant transactions affecting the Group, whether
initiated within or outside of its perimeter, are comprehensively analyzed and, where necessary, appropriately
recognized and disclosed in the financial statements, deficiencies in controls over user access to our critical
information technology, deficiencies in processes and controls relating to capitalization, commencement of
depreciation and assessing the useful lives and in respect of property, plant and equipment, deficiencies in
accounting for certain potential tax exposures and deficiencies in the process of application of the new
accounting standards.

We continuously evaluate our policies and procedures to develop our internal controls, and we monitor our
internal controls to identify any deficiencies, including as identified above.

If our internal controls do not keep pace with growth in the size and sophistication of our businesses and the
applicable financial reporting framework, we may not be able to implement and maintain adequate internal
controls. If we fail to implement and maintain effective internal controls, it could result in material
misstatements in our financial statements or failure to meet our reporting obligations in a timely manner,
which may cause a loss of confidence in our reported financial information and could have a negative impact
on the trading price and liquidity of the New Notes.

**_We may face difficulties in increasing our subscriber base or our subscription fees or up selling new products to_**
**_current subscribers._**

Our revenue growth primarily results from the growth of our subscriber base and increase in our subscription
fees. We may not be able to sustain the level of subscriber growth, and further increases in subscription fees
may meet customer resistance and lead to increases in churn rates. If we are unable to execute our business
strategy, the Pay-TV, broadband internet and fixed-line and mobile-telephony markets in the regions in which
we operate do not continue to grow as we expect, or we encounter other unforeseen difficulties in acquiring


-----

new subscribers or selling additional products and services to existing subscribers, we may experience a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Additionally, a number of free television channels are available across the markets in which we operate.
Historically, the migration of subscribers from unmanaged free terrestrial television has been slow. While we
believe that our product offering is of a higher quality than the television channels available free of charge,
there can be no assurance that the speed with which customers migrate from free television services to Pay-TV
services will increase, and consequently, we cannot guarantee that Pay-TV penetration rates across
Southeastern Europe will converge on the higher penetration rates characteristic of other major Western
European markets which may, in turn, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_Customer churn may adversely affect our financial performance._**

Customer churn refers to those subscribers who cease subscribing to one or more of our products and services.
In the ordinary course of our business, we experience a loss of customers due to their choice to obtain services
from a competitor (including from competing types of services, such as OTT TV services in lieu of cable
Pay-TV, or mobile-telephony in lieu of fixed-line service), relocation of our customers to areas not covered by
our network and cancellation of services for customers who, after several reminders, do not pay our invoices.
For example, our annual cable Pay-TV subscriber churn rates for the three months ended March 31, 2021
were 8% for the Telemach Slovenia segment, 10% for the SBB Serbia segment, 9% for the Telemach BH
segment and 11% for the Vivacom segment (based on IPTV subscribers).

Factors impacting churn in our consumer subscriber base include existing customers moving outside of our
current geographical area of service as well as termination of services contracts by us due to existing
customers’ inability to pay, as well as competition. For example, any interruption of our services, the removal
or unavailability of programming or any other customer service problems, whether or not attributable to us,
could contribute to increased subscriber churn or cause us to fail in our goal of reducing the level of churn of
our Pay-TV, broadband internet and fixed-line and mobile-telephony services. Additionally, price increases
(by us or across the industry) could lead to increased subscriber churn.

Subscriber churn reduces our subscription base and causes us to incur additional costs to replace the cancelled
subscribers, such as advertising and marketing costs. A significant increase in our churn rates may require us
to incur additional costs to replace subscribers lost to cancellation. Additionally, even with increased
marketing efforts, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to replace the subscribers who left us at all.
Therefore, if a significant number of our subscribers cancel or do not renew their contracts with us, our
business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected. Additionally, we incur
upfront cash expenses for the installation of our cable TV and internet equipment and handset subsidies with
new customers which we recoup over the duration of the services contract. As a result, should an increased
number of subscribers cancel our services before we can recoup these initial cash expenses, this would have a
negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our marketing and advertising expenses may increase in the future._**

Historically, we have had low marketing and advertising budgets and have competed on the quality of our
content and services instead. Should we be unable to compete on the quality of our content and services in the
future, for example, as a result of loss of content to our competitors, we may need to increase our marketing
and advertising efforts, which would lead to an increase in marketing expenses. If we are unable to offset such
increases in marketing and advertising expenses with increased prices for our products and services, our
profitability, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively affected.

**_Failure in our technology or telecommunications systems as a result of technical errors, cyber security_**
**_breaches or other factors could significantly disrupt our operations._**

Our success depends on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology, HFC
network systems, mobile network and customer service centers. If any part of our HFC network, mobile
network or IT infrastructure or any of our customer service centers is compromised or damaged by flood, fire
or other natural disaster, terrorism, illegal piracy, power loss, system failure, denial of service attack,
cyber-attack or other catastrophe, our operations could be materially adversely affected. Disaster recovery,
security and service continuity protection measures that we currently have or may in the future undertake, and
our monitoring of network performance, may be insufficient to prevent losses.


-----

In addition, our business is dependent on sophisticated critical systems, such as our customer service systems
and billing systems. Despite the presence of back-up systems, we can provide no assurances that our network
and technical systems will not be damaged by physical or electronic breakdowns, cyber-attacks, computer
viruses or similar disruptions. In addition, unforeseen problems may create disruptions in our information
technology systems. There can be no assurance that our existing security system, security policy, back-up
systems, physical access security and access protection, user administration and emergency plans will be
sufficient to prevent data loss or minimize network downtime. Sustained or repeated disruptions or damage
to our network and technical systems that prevent, interrupt, delay or make it more difficult for us to provide
products and services to our customers in accordance with the agreements we have with our customers may
trigger claims for payment of damages or contractual remedies and would cause considerable damage to our
reputation, lead to the loss of customers and require repairs or replacement of part of our network, all of
which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Additionally, we rely on hardware, software, technical services and customer support provided by third parties.
We do not control the proper functioning of such third-party equipment, and to the extent hardware, software,
technical services and customer support provided by third parties fails, our business operations may be
adversely affected. For example, in 2015 our mobile operations in Slovenia were disrupted for a four hour
period due to technical problems with our mobile network.

Further, any security breaches, such as misappropriation, misuse, penetration by viruses, worms or other
destructive or disruptive software, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained
in our information technology systems (or those of our business partners) and networks, including customer,
personnel and vendor data, could damage our reputation, result in legal and/or regulatory action against us,
and require us to expend significant capital and other resources to remedy any such security breach. The
occurrence of any such network or information system related events or security breaches could have a
material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

**_We operate in a capital intensive business that may result in depreciation or impairment costs or prevent us_**
**_from generating positive returns._**

The Pay-TV, broadband internet and fixed-line and mobile-telephony markets in which we operate are capital
intensive and significant capital investments are required to add customers to our network, including for
equipment and labor costs. In addition, an increase in our customers’ internet usage or demand for higher
bandwidth may require us to further invest in the capacity of our network. As a result, we expect that
technological innovation as well as ongoing customer growth will lead to additional capital expenditure. In
addition, any new or enhanced products or services we introduce, including internet and telephony products,
may require an upgrade of local and in-house networks, in which case we may be required to cover a portion,
or all, of the costs of such upgrade. Our current assumptions regarding the costs associated with the
maintenance and further development of our cable and mobile networks, including the implementation of
new standards, may prove to be inaccurate. No assurance can be given that our future investments and network
upgrades will generate a positive return or that we will have adequate capital available to finance such future
upgrades. In addition, rapidly changing technology requires careful review of life cycles for our assets and
may result in additional depreciation or impairment costs. If we are unable to, or elect not to, pay for costs
associated with adding new customers, expanding or upgrading our network or making our other planned or
unplanned capital expenditure, or if we experience unexpected material depreciation or impairment costs, or
do not manage our project portfolio effectively to ensure the proper allocation of resources between projects,
our growth could be limited and our competitive position could be harmed.

**_We depend on third-party providers of hardware, software, satellite services, network access and customer_**
**_support._**

We rely on third-party vendors to supply us with a significant amount of customer equipment such as receiver
boxes, hardware, including mobile handsets, software, satellite services, and operational or technical support
necessary to operate our network and systems and provide our services.

In many cases, our services depend on the technical specifications of equipment or software of a particular
provider such as the method of content encryption, making it difficult for us to quickly change supply,
maintenance or other essential relationships in the event that our provider refuses to offer us favorable prices,
fails to provide the support that we require, or ceases to produce equipment or provide satisfactory customer
service. Additionally, if our suppliers were to discontinue certain products or services, were unable to provide
equipment to meet our specifications or interrupt the provision of equipment or services to us, or seek to
charge us prices that are not competitive or withdraw discounts that have been previously agreed, we may have


-----

to find alternative suppliers. Switching to alternative suppliers could cause us to experience difficulties or
delays, or to incur significant costs, or if we were unable to replace such services or products in a timely and
cost-efficient manner, our business and profitability could be materially adversely affected.

We are party to a number of roaming agreements, under which we are provided with network services allowing
us to offer mobile-telephony services to our subscribers in areas where we do not have our own network
coverage. The loss of any of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

In addition, an increase in the number and volume of calls by our subscribers served on the networks of other
MNOs could require future negotiations for lower national roaming/network sharing prices in order to
maintain or decrease the cost of national roaming/network sharing, which may not be achievable. If any of
the events described above were to occur, our national roaming/network sharing or interconnection costs
could increase. In the event that this disrupts our network access or coverage in a manner which we cannot
resolve through our other agreements, we may have to increase our capital expenditure in order to extend our
radio network or enter into agreements with other network access providers on terms that may not be as
favorable as the terms of the terminated agreement. If any of these events were to occur, or if we face an
increase in costs incurred under one of our national roaming/network sharing agreements, it would have an
adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations, or, if we are not able to fund capital
expenditure to extend our radio network, such failure would affect the level of services which we can offer
which could cause us to lose subscribers or fail to attract new subscribers, which could, in turn, have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our reputation as a supplier and service provider of high-quality Pay-TV, broadband internet and fixed-line_**
**_and mobile-telephony offerings or the value associated with our brands may be adversely affected._**

Our business depends on our reputation and our ability to maintain good relationships with our subscribers,
suppliers, employees and local regulators. The brands under which we sell our products and services, including
Telemach in Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro; SBB in Serbia; Vivacom in Bulgaria,
Forthnet in Greece and Total TV for our DTH platform throughout Southeastern Europe (with the exception
of Croatia beginning in January 2018, due to the divestiture of our Total TV operations in Croatia in
connection with the Nova TV Croatia Acquisition) are well-recognized brands in their respective jurisdictions.
In addition, we own and operate some of the strongest brand names in the region, including Sport Klub, N1,
Nova S, Grand, IDJ and Pikaboo, together with Nova TV, Nova BH and Nova M, the leading national TV
stations in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro, respectively. Our reputation, brand image and
competitive advantage may be harmed either through product defects, such as the failure of our network,
branded routers and branded TV equipment (including failures or defects of equipment provided by third
parties), or shortfalls in our customer service, such as a failure to provide reliable product maintenance or
assist with connection problems. Any harm done to our reputation, business relationships or brand value as a
result of our actions, or actions of others could have a significant negative effect on us and on the value of our
brands which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Furthermore, our relationships with our subscribers are of particular importance. Subscribers generally judge
our performance through their interactions with the staff at our monitoring centers, the reliability of our
products and our maintenance performance for any products that require repair. If we fail to meet our
subscribers’ expectations, we may lose subscribers or have greater difficulty attracting new subscribers, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have
also experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, a slightly negative perception of our brand by
certain groups of the population in Bosnia and Herzegovina as a result of the recent political history of the
region and our perceived Serbian identity. Any damage to the value of our brands caused by any of the
foregoing or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations.

**_Our business may be adversely affected by the alleged health risks of antenna sites and the use of mobile_**
**_telephones._**

We are aware of allegations that there may be health risks associated with the effects of electromagnetic
signals from antenna sites, mobile telephones and other telecommunications devices. We cannot provide
assurances that further medical research and studies will not establish a link between the radio frequency
emissions of mobile handsets or telecommunications base stations and these health concerns. The European
Commission has been investigating these concerns since 1995. Should such allegations prove correct,


-----

regulatory authorities in our countries of operation could increase regulation of mobile telephones and
telecommunications base stations. Additionally, the actual or perceived risk of telecommunications devices,
press reports about risks or any litigation relating to such risks could adversely affect us through a reduction
in the size or growth rate of our customer base, a decline in usage by our customers or through increased
litigation costs and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may not be able to attract or retain personnel who are key to our business._**

We depend on our key management and personnel, including our founder and chairman of the advisory
board, Dragan Šolak, all of whom we believe are highly skilled and many of whom have been with our various
businesses since their inception. As the markets in which we operate are highly competitive, there is significant
competition in attracting and retaining qualified personnel in the telecommunications industry, especially
individuals with experience in the cable sector. Despite our key management and personnel’s long history of
service and involvement in and commitment to our business, we cannot assure you that we will be successful
in retaining the services of our key management or personnel or that we would be successful in hiring and
training suitable replacements without undue costs or delays. As a result, the loss of any of these key employees
could cause significant disruptions to our business operations, which could materially adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The operation of our business depends in part on agreements with our competitors._**

While we compete with Telekom Srbija, Telekom Slovenije, the incumbent Bulgarian and Bosnian operators
and Crnogorski (Montenegrin) Telekom in the respective television, internet and telephony markets, we also
rely on long-term services and assets provided by them. For example, we lease cable duct space used for parts
of our cable network and purchase telephony interconnection services and mobile network services from
Telekom Slovenije in Slovenia, and rely on lease agreements with Telekom Srbija and HT Eronet for cable
duct space and the use of their fixed telephone lines in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Furthermore,
Telekom Slovenije provides us with fiber optic connection lines for certain areas. In addition, we have
interconnection agreements with our Bulgarian competitors, including collocation agreements, and rely on
lease agreements with them for fiber optic connection lines for certain areas in Bulgaria. In Croatia, we have
national roaming agreements, site sharing agreements and leased line agreements with Croatian Telekom, as
well as site sharing agreements, leased line agreements and dark fiber agreements with A1. In Greece, Forthnet
has agreements with both OTE and an MVNO contract with Vodafone.

Our ability to offer our services to our customers depends on the performance of the respective partner of
their obligations under the applicable lease and services agreements. Pursuant to the terms of such lease and
services agreements, the respective other party has the right to terminate the services under the agreements in
certain circumstances and under certain conditions or has the right to unilaterally increase prices. For example,
in 2011, Telekom Srbija significantly raised prices for the use of their duct space. The termination of any
material portion or all of such lease or service agreements would require us to find alternative solutions and it
may be difficult to establish an alternative at a reasonable price, which would adversely affect the value of our
business. Additionally, our business relationships with our state-owned competitors might be affected by a
close alignment between the state’s interests and our competitor’s business operations as a result of which our
competitors might, for example, enjoy special privileges with regulatory authorities. Additionally, should we
be unable to successfully negotiate moderate price increases, or should we be unable to pass through price
increases to our customers, our profitability, financial condition and results of operation may be adversely
affected.

**_We may not be successful in maintaining the necessary regulatory authorization or licenses needed to operate_**
**_our business and such authorizations and licenses may be invalid or may be subject to termination, revocation or_**
**_material alterations in the event of a breach or to promote public interest._**

We currently hold numerous regulatory authorizations and licenses necessary to operate our business. In
addition, we hold numerous radio frequency licenses in Slovenia, Bulgaria and Croatia. We cannot assure you
that all of our authorizations or licenses are valid, that we will be able to maintain all authorizations and
licenses necessary to operate our business or that we will be able to renew our authorizations or licenses when
they expire. The loss of any of our authorizations or licenses or a material modification of the terms of any
existing or renewed licenses may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flow. For example, some competitors initially successfully challenged before the Slovenian
administrative court the grant of a block of spectrum in 2008 to Tušmobil (which in April 2015 was acquired
by, and later merged into, Telemach Slovenia), which we use for part of our 3G mobile services. Although the


-----

administrative court has now ruled in our favor against AKOS, as the matter was sent back to AKOS for a
new determination process, we cannot rule out either that, in any repeated tender for this block of spectrum,
we may ultimately be unsuccessful in securing all of the spectrum or that we may need to pay a fee or rent for
use of the spectrum. See “Our Business—Legal Proceedings—Litigation Matters Relating to Telemach Slovenia
_(as Successor to Tušmobil).”_

Additionally, like all other broadcasters, we must comply with national broadcasting laws and regulations,
and the terms and conditions of our licenses in order to maintain our licenses. If we are held to be in material
breach of any applicable law or the terms and conditions of our licenses, our licenses may be revoked. In
addition, if our activity under our licenses is carried out in a manner that is deemed to conflict with applicable
law or the terms and conditions of our licenses, and we fail to remedy such conflict within the applicable grace
period, our licenses may be revoked. Any revocation of our licenses could adversely affect our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

**_We may be unable to secure spectrum in the future, which would prevent or impair our plans or limit the need_**
**_for our services and products._**

Our ability to provide certain services to customers is highly dependent on our access to sufficient spectrum.
However, the amount of available spectrum suitable for our operations is limited and the process for obtaining
it is complex. We therefore cannot guarantee that we, or our customers, will have sufficient access to spectrum
to maintain and develop our services in the future. We believe that spectrum licenses will be particularly
important for competing for 4G and 5G networks during the next five to ten years, and to that end we have
successfully acquired 5G spectrum in Bulgaria and Slovenia and are participating in a spectrum auction in
Croatia. There can be no guarantee that we will be successful in our efforts to outbid competitors for blocks
of frequency in these bands in upcoming auctions. In addition, should the governments of the countries in
which we operate decide to reallocate spectrum to 5G, then we may be required to obtain additional spectrum
to maintain our existing product offering. We believe that spectrum success in coming spectrum auctions will
be pivotal to meet the growing capacity demand in the mobile market and to accommodate new 5G services.

In addition, a new mobile network operator could successfully enter the mobile telecommunications market
in the countries in which we operate. Although the long-term nature of the licenses granted in spectrum
auctions could constitute significant barriers to entry for potential new competitors, a new MNO could
develop and operate a network infrastructure in a specific geographical region in which we operate.

If any new MNO were to successfully enter our mobile telecommunications market as a competitor or existing
operators were to combine or share their resources or infrastructure, it could materially reduce our market
share and could overall have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_EU regulation of the levels of roaming charges may in the future have a material adverse effect on our_**
**_business._**

EU regulators have imposed price restrictions applicable to all operators in the EU (both at the retail and
wholesale level). In particular, in 2007, the European Regulation (EC) No 717/2007 of the European
Parliament and the European Council of June 27, 2007 on roaming on public mobile telephone networks
within the European Community (the “Community”) amending Directive 2002/21/EC came into effect, as
well as, in 2009, Regulation (EC) No 544/2009 of the European Parliament and of the European Council of
June 18, 2009 was introduced amending Regulation (EC) No 717/2007 on roaming on public mobile telephone
networks within the Community. Both provided for a steady reduction in mobile retail and wholesale prices
for voice calls, SMS and data. On June 13, 2012, however, Regulation (EC) No 544/2009 was repealed by
Regulation (EU) No. 531/2012 of the European Parliament and of the European Council of June 13, 2012 on
roaming on public mobile communications networks within the EU. Pursuant to the latter regulation, the
maximum retail prices and average wholesale prices for roaming mobile services (calls, mobile data and SMS)
decreased on July 1, 2013 and decreased further on July 1, 2014, and were fully eliminated on June 15, 2017.
Additionally, a “decoupling regime”has been introduced to increase competition in the international roaming
market, and the result has been a reduction in international roaming retail prices to below the regulatory caps.
This “decoupling regime” came into effect on July 1, 2014 and introduced market participants in the form of
alternative roaming providers. Additionally, the “decoupling regime” foresees local break out services (the
ability for foreign MNOs to target our outbound roaming customers to directly offer them data only services
on their networks). Such services would be paid directly by such roaming customer to the visited roaming
network.


-----

Furthermore, certain countries in the region, including Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro,
are party to a regional initiative for a phased reduction of roaming prices between such countries. In the
region, from July 1, 2019, mobile calls cost €0.19 per minute, SMS service costs €0.06 per message and mobile
data costs €0.18 per megabyte (all prices exclusive of VAT). Pursuant to this initiative, as of July 1, 2021,
roaming costs were abolished between Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Kosovo,
North Macedonia and Serbia. This shift could create increased price pressure on roaming charges that forces
us to lower our prices further to match the market standard or risk losing customers to other providers.
Reduction of prices of mobile roaming services, as well as operation of alternative roaming providers may
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.

**_There can be no assurance that our countries of operations will continue to successfully implement their_**
**_respective political and economic reforms and agendas._**

In recent years, certain countries in which we operate have implemented significant political and economic
reforms aimed at, inter alia, reducing economic and structural imbalances, increasing the flexibility of their
respective economies, including liberalization of the media and telecommunications sectors and creating a
business friendly environment that is conducive to foreign investment.

While Slovenia joined the European Union in 2004 and has generally made the transition to a functioning
market economy, the political and economic reforms implemented by the respective governments of Croatia,
despite having joined the European Union in 2013, and of Serbia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Bosnia
and Herzegovina are at a less developed stage than Slovenia.

Since the end of the Yugoslav wars in 1995, the countries formerly comprising Yugoslavia have made
significant progress towards becoming more democratic and liberalized market economies; however, building
Serbia’s, Bosnia and Herzegovina’s, Montenegro’s, Croatia’s and North Macedonia’s political and economic
systems and infrastructure to a CEE or Western European standard will require further investment and may
take some years to complete. We cannot assure you that Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Croatia
and North Macedonia will achieve their intended aims with the implemented reforms, that a political
environment supportive of these reforms will be maintained or that the governments in the respective countries
will not implement regulations or fiscal or monetary policies, or otherwise take actions which could have a
material adverse effect on our business.

Additionally, the key risk to stability in Serbia remains the status of Kosovo’s independence, and the country’s
history of political instability makes it difficult to predict the occurrence of events or circumstances, such as
war or hostilities, and no assurance can be given that we would be able to sustain our current profit levels in
Serbia if adverse political events or circumstances were to occur.

Following the completion of the Vivacom Acquisition, we also have operations in Bulgaria. Although
Bulgaria, a former communist country which joined NATO in 2004 and the EU in 2007, has an open economy
that historically has demonstrated strong growth, economic headwinds remain in the near and long-term.
Corruption in public administration, a weak judiciary, weak productivity, a lack of transparency in public
procurements, an uncertain political environment and the presence of organized crime present significant
challenges to sustainable economic growth in Bulgaria.

The foregoing political and economic challenges in the countries in which we operate could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may become subject to more extensive regulation due to our scale._**

The European Union competition framework imposes pricing and other potential requirements on entities
deemed to have significant market power (“SMP”) in non-competitive relevant markets in which they operate.
Among other markets, the European Commission has identified “wholesale broadband access” and “the
termination on an individual fixed network” as relevant markets. The European Union competition
framework has been implemented in Slovenia and Bulgaria; Croatia has largely aligned its law with the EU
requirements; and Serbia, albeit not yet an EU Member State, continues its efforts to harmonize its law with
the European framework and has recently promulgated new rules applicable to the electronic communications
sector.

Telemach Slovenia is deemed to have SMP in: (i) voice call termination in an individual public mobile
telephone network (inter operator market) and (ii) call termination in an individual telephone network at a
fixed location (inter operator market). Vivacom has been deemed to have SMP in the following regulated
markets: (i) termination on fixed network, (ii) call termination for mobile voice service and (iii), until


-----

June 2019, local access provided at a fixed location wholesale access provided at a fixed location. Telemach
Croatia has been deemed to have SMP in the market for voice call termination in an individual public mobile
telephone network. SBB Serbia is currently deemed to have SMP on the wholesale market for call termination
in public telephone networks on fixed location and the wholesale market of central access service provided on
a fixed location for mass market products. Telemach BH and MNE were also determined to have SMP on the
wholesale market for call termination in the individual public network at a fixed location.

Being designated as having SMP may carry with it: an obligation to publish data from accounting records,
technical specifications, network characteristics, terms and conditions for supply and use or validity periods
of offers and prices; an obligation to only engage in nondiscriminatory conduct; an obligation to keep separate
accounts for interconnection and access services; an obligation to provide access and use of parts of our
network infrastructure and associated facilities to third parties; price controls and cost based accounting; an
obligation to make available a minimum set of leased lines; an obligation to offer operator selection and
operator pre-selection services; and regulation of retail services, including an obligation to unbundle products
and services.

There is a risk that we could be found to have SMP in other geographical markets in which we operate if local
regulators identify these areas as relevant markets in which there is not sufficient competition. The designation
of our business as an SMP provider could result in requiring us to provide other service providers access to
our network for purposes of providing competing broadband and broadcasting services at regulated prices,
and impose other restrictions on how we operate our network and market our services, including the
imposition of a requirement to obtain additional permits and licenses for our operations. Granting such
access would limit the bandwidth available to us to provide other products and services to our customers.
Such regulation could, among other things, impair our ability to use our bandwidth in ways that would
generate maximum revenue, create a shortage of capacity on our network, which could limit the types and
variety of services we could provide to our customers, strengthen our competitors by granting them access in
our network and lowering their costs to offer competing products and services and have a significant adverse
impact on our profitability.

Forthnet in Greece acts as universal service provider, which also impose certain regulatory filings on it.

Furthermore, we may be subject to fines for infringement of relevant local competition laws. For example, we
have been subject to competition proceedings in Bosnia related to our provision of sports content, and in
2015 and 2017, United Media Distribution, a former subsidiary of the Group, was fined approximately
€250,000 for an allegation of continuing abuse of dominance. We have taken steps to address the concerns of
the Bosnian competition authorities, including offering our sports content to third parties on terms that are
comparable to those on which we offer this content to our Group companies. However, some competitors and
the association of cable operators in Bosnia and Herzegovina have requested further fines in relation to these
matters.

In addition, we are subject to proceedings in Slovenia related to competition rules connected to alleged abuse
of dominant market position and with respect to certain of our acquisitions. See “—We have made and may
_make acquisitions or enter into transactions that may present unforeseen risks, and we may not realize the_
_financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction and, additionally, there are_
_risks associated with the integration of any acquisitions.”_

We cannot guarantee that we will not be subject to further regulatory scrutiny in respect of: (i) our market
position in Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece or any other
jurisdiction in which we operate, (ii) matters involving merger control filings or (iii) exclusive and restrictive
content contracts, and may be liable to pay fines or other sanctions in the future, especially as local law and
local customs continue to be updated based on CEE or Western European legal standards.

**_Changes in labor laws may make it more costly to operate our business in the future._**

We are exposed to the risk of strikes, work stoppages and other industrial actions. While the substantial
majority of our employees currently are not members of labor unions, we cannot guarantee that a larger
portion of our employees will not associate with such unions in the future, especially as the labor standards in
our countries of operations converge with CEE or Western European standards. As a result, we might also
become subject to collective bargaining agreements which could regulate, inter alia, the general labor
conditions of our employees, working hours, holidays, termination, provisions and general payment schemes
for wages. Moreover, strikes and other industrial actions, as well as the negotiation of collective bargaining


-----

agreements or salary increases in the future, could disrupt our operations and make it more costly to operate
our facilities, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

Furthermore, our business operations might be negatively affected by changes in local labor law and labor
market practice, such as the imposition of, or increases in, minimum wages, or a more restrictive interpretation
of the status of alternative hiring arrangements as employment. While we believe we are currently in line with
local, regional and national labor market practices, there can be no assurance that labor laws, market practice,
or enforcement focus, will not change. Should we fail to comply with relevant labor laws and regulations, we
might be exposed to fines which could have a negative impact on our profitability, financial condition and
result of operations.

**_Sensitive customer data is an important part of our daily business and leakage of such data may violate laws_**
**_and regulations which could result in fines reputational damage and customer churn, and adversely affect our_**
**_business._**

In the normal course of our business, we accumulate, store and use data which is protected by data protection
laws. The data protection authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate have the right to audit us and
impose fines if they find we have not complied with the applicable laws and adequately protected customer
data. Although we take industry standard precautions to protect customer data in accordance with the
applicable privacy requirements, we cannot exclude the possibility that sensitive data may leak in the future
due to human error, technological failure, database piracy, security breaches or other circumstances. We
cooperate with third-party service providers, for the provision of call center services, for example, and
independent sales agents, and we cannot exclude the possibility that such third parties could also experience
system failures involving the storage or transmission of proprietary information. In addition, although the
terms of our contracts restrict the usage of customer data and we perform pre-contractual due diligence, we
cannot guarantee that third parties will abide by the contractual terms. Violation of data protection laws by
such third parties or ourselves may result in fines, reputational damage and customer churn, as well as the
misappropriation of confidential information, interruptions in our operations and damage to hardware
infrastructure, and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Although we have implemented significant technical and operational measures, we may be exposed to database
piracy or other database security breaches which could result in the leakage and unauthorized dissemination
of information about our subscribers, including their names, addresses, home phone numbers, individual tax
numbers and other personal data. Even though we have data breach response plans in place, the breach of
security of our database and illegal sale or other unauthorized release of our subscribers’personal information
could materially adversely impact our reputation, prompt lawsuits against us by individual and corporate
subscribers, lead to violations of data protection laws and adverse actions by the telecommunications
regulators and other authorities, lead to a loss in subscribers and hinder our ability to attract new subscribers.
For example, in June 2020 we detected that Telemach Croatia had been affected by a cyber-intrusion and
breach of its customers’ personal data site in early 2020, in which certain personal data became available to
third parties. Although there is no evidence that any personal data was actually extracted from the relevant
servers, we have reported the event to the applicable regulators and taken remedial steps to prevent future
breaches. We do not currently expect any financial consequences stemming from the breach, but we cannot
rule out such outcomes in the future. If severe customer data security breaches are detected, regulatory
authorities may sanction us, and such sanctions can include suspension of operations for some time period.
In addition, we may be exposed to cyber-attacks, which could result in equipment failures or disruptions in
our operations. Our inability to operate our network as a result of such events may result in significant expense
or loss of market shares. These factors, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We are subject to European data protection laws and regulations. These laws and regulations regulate
numerous important aspects of our business and place material constraints on our interactions with
consumers. The General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation EU/2016/679, “GDPR”), entered into force
on May 25, 2018 and covers legal areas relating to the protection as well as the free movement of personal data
and provides for potential penalties of up to €20 million or 4% of total worldwide annual turnover for cases of
non-compliance. As data protection authorities continue to release guidance on the implementation of GDPR
obligations, the legal framework will evolve and best practice examples will continue to emerge and may
require us to adapt our policies in compliance. GDPR requires us to ensure that data minimization is
embedded across the Group so that only the appropriate amount of data required for any particular purpose
is processed, that we delete any unnecessary datasets and that we anonymize data wherever possible. The


-----

implementation of these obligations creates increased compliance risk that may lead to regulatory
intervention. For example, in 2018, Telemach Slovenia was subject to proceedings initiated by AKOS
concerning the storage of traffic data relating to prepaid users and the implementation of measures for the
timely deletion of, and prevention of unauthorized access to, subscriber data which could have resulted in a
fine ranging between €50,000 and €400,000. In these proceedings, Telemach Slovenia was found to be
compliant. In addition, any irregularities could expose us to claims for damages by subscribers.

Furthermore, we provide mobile, broadband and landline voice services to a number of public and private
financial institutions, government entities and corporate customers with data security requirements. These
customers may continue to increase their data security requirements, and we may be required to undertake
additional investments in order to adhere to these enhanced data security requirements, as well as evolving
statutory and regulatory requirements, including obtaining and maintaining certain ISO certifications,
improving access rights management systems and developing a corporate data encryption infrastructure. As a
result, we may undertake additional capital expenditure to satisfy data security requirements. If we are unable
to satisfy such data security requirements, customers could decide to terminate their contracts with us, and
such terminations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_We are involved in a number of civil, administrative and criminal legal proceedings which, if adversely_**
**_determined, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and profitability, or could lead to_**
**_reputational damage that could have a material impact on our business._**

From time to time, we may become involved in legal or regulatory proceedings, claims or investigations,
including by governmental bodies, licensing authorities, customers, suppliers, competitors, former employees,
class action plaintiffs and others. Should any of these matters be decided against us, it could have a material
adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business and on our financial condition. On an ongoing basis,
we attempt to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these proceedings or claims, and
to take all necessary steps to adequately defend our interests, although it is difficult to predict final outcomes
with any degree of certainty and we can offer no assurances in this regard.

We are currently involved in a number of legal proceedings that have arisen in the ordinary course of our
business, including disputes related to intellectual property rights. Please see “Our Business—Legal
_Proceedings.”_

From time to time, we may also become involved in litigation matters pending against entities that we acquire.
For example, KATV HS d.o.o. and HKB net d.o.o., two small cable operators in Bosnia and Herzegovina that
we acquired in July 2015, are subject to disputes with their minority shareholders relating to a prior sale of
these companies. The outcome of these disputes is difficult to anticipate and could have an adverse effect on
our financial position and profitability if the final, non-appealable judgments in these matters are not
consistent with our current expectations.

Further, Telemach Slovenia, as successor to Tušmobil, which we acquired in April 2015, has had certain
criminal proceedings pending against it, its then-owner Mirko Tuš and former head of AKOS (Tomaž
Simonič) since 2015. A final court decision in February 2019 recognized that the statute of limitations had
expired for Telemach Slovenia. Although following this decision Telemach Slovenia can no longer be found to
be criminally liable, Telemach Slovenia may still be required to make an indemnification payment as a recipient
of an alleged illegal benefit, if any of the other alleged offenders (against whom the criminal proceedings are
still continuing) are found to be criminally liable. In February 2020, the first instance court acquitted Tomaž
Simonič of the charges in the amended bill of indictment regarding misuse of public positions or rights. In
December 2020, upon the public prosecutor’s appeal, the Higher Court of Ljubljana annulled this judgment
and returned the case to the first instance court for retrial. The outcome of these proceedings, although
difficult to predict, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and profitability if the final,
non-appealable judgment in this matter is not consistent with our current expectations, and we are not able to
successfully recover such amounts from Tušmobil’s seller. In addition, Telemach Slovenia had certain
administrative proceedings against it in which the grant of a block of spectrum which we use for part of our
3G mobile services was initially successfully challenged in front of the Slovenian administrative court. The
fact that the administrative court has now ruled in our favor against AKOS in this matter, reduces, but does
not eliminate, the likelihood that we would need to re-tender for this block or pay a fee or rent for use of the
spectrum, as this matter was sent back to AKOS for a new determination process. See “Our Business—Legal
_Proceedings.”_


-----

In addition, we and/or Vivacom are, or might become, subject to legal proceedings and investigations in
various jurisdictions, including, without limitation, the pending former Vivacom shareholder litigation in
Luxembourg or as a result of the entry into the Vivacom Acquisition Agreement. See “Our Business—Legal
_Proceedings.” We are, and will be, unable to predict an outcome, favorable or unfavorable, or to estimate the_
amount of any potential loss in connection with any such legal proceedings. There is also a risk that the
former direct and indirect shareholders of the Vivacom Seller attempt to initiate other proceedings in Bulgaria
or other jurisdictions in support of the pending Luxembourg shareholder litigation, or to attempt to reverse
the consummation of, or claim damages due to, the Vivacom Acquisition.

If we are successfully joined as a defendant to legal proceedings and claims are made against us and/or adverse
developments in any on-going litigations occur, we may incur additional costs or may be required to pay
damages or similar fees. Such costs, damages or fees may be in excess of amounts for which we are able to
collect under contractual arrangements, including the Vivacom Acquisition Agreement.

We cannot assure you that the costs, charges, liabilities or other regulatory outcomes associated with any of
the foregoing matters will not be material, or that those costs, charges, liabilities or regulatory outcomes will
not exceed any amounts reserved for them in our financial statements. In future periods, we could be subject
to cash costs or non-cash charges to earnings if any of these matters are resolved unfavorably to us.
Additionally, any reputational damage associated with such legal or regulatory proceedings could have a
material impact on our business. See “Our Business—Legal Proceedings.”

Ongoing and future legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

**_Our intellectual property rights and other security measures may not fully protect our operations._**

Some of our products contain proprietary or licensed content that is transmitted through our Pay-TV
channels. We rely on trademark, copyright and other intellectual property laws to establish and protect our
rights to this content. However, our intellectual property rights and other security measures may not fully
protect our operations, and we cannot guarantee that the intellectual property rights we rely on will not be
challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew our
rights to such content when the term of protection for any such trademark or copyright expires, and any
failure to protect our content, technology and know-how could result in loss of customers to our competitors
and decreased profits.

Even if our intellectual property rights remain intact, we cannot assure you that security and anti-piracy
measures will prevent unauthorized access to our services and piracy of our content. Third parties may be
able to copy, infringe or otherwise profit from our proprietary and licensed content, without our, or the
respective right holders’, authorization. The risk of piracy is especially acute in our Pay-TV business segment.
Media piracy occurs in many parts of the world, including Southeastern Europe, and is facilitated by
technological advances and the conversion of media content into digital formats, which make it easier to
create, transmit and share high-quality unauthorized copies, on videotapes and DVDs, from pay per view
through set-top boxes and through unlicensed broadcasts on free-to-air TV and the internet. In addition, the
lack of internet specific legislation relating to trademark and copyright protection creates additional
challenges for us in protecting our intellectual property rights in cyberspace. The unauthorized use of our
intellectual property may adversely affect our business by harming our reputation and by decreasing the
confidence our business partners rest in our ability to protect our proprietary and licensed content.

**_If a third-party claims that we breached its intellectual property rights, we may be forced to make significant_**
**_expenditures to either defend ourselves against such claims, license rights to the third-party’s technology or to_**
**_identify ways to conduct our operations without breaching such rights._**

The success of our business depends to an extent on the use of intellectual property rights, in particular rights
to advanced technological solutions, software and programming content. We cannot guarantee that we have
not breached or that we will not in the future breach the intellectual property rights of third parties. Any
alleged breach could expose us to liability claims from third parties. In addition, we may be required to obtain
a license or acquire new solutions that allow us to conduct our business in a manner that does not breach such
third-party rights, and we may be forced to expend significant time, resources and money in order to defend
ourselves against such allegations. The diversion of management’s time and resources along with potentially
significant expenses that could be involved could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition,
results of operations and prospects.


-----

**_We are subject to increases in operating costs and inflation risks which may adversely affect our earnings._**

We are subject to increasing operating costs. We are also impacted by inflationary increases in salaries, wages,
benefits and other administrative costs. While we aim to increase our subscription rates to offset increases in
operating costs, we may not be successful in doing so. For example, see “—We may become subject to more
_extensive regulation due to our scale.” Price increases are also associated with expenses, in particular, service_
costs. As a result, our operating costs may increase faster than associated revenues, resulting in a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may be adversely affected by changes to tax legislation or its interpretation or increases in effective tax_**
**_rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate, or challenges to our tax position._**

We are subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions, in particular, in the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Slovenia,
Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Croatia, Bulgaria and Greece, and are subject to complex tax
laws. Our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of factors in addition to our operating
results, including the amount of taxable income in particular jurisdictions, the tax rates in those jurisdictions,
tax treaties between jurisdictions, the manner in which, and extent to which, we transfer funds to and repatriate
funds from our subsidiaries, accounting standards and changes in accounting standards, and future changes
in tax law. There cannot be certainty that the relevant tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretation
of relevant tax laws. If our tax positions are challenged by the relevant tax authorities, the imposition of
additional taxes could require us to pay taxes that we currently do not collect or pay or increase the costs of
our services to track and collect such taxes, which could increase our costs of operations or our effective tax
rate and have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, in
2019, the Serbian Ministry of Finance Tax Authority (the “Serbian Tax Authority”) conducted a tax
investigation of SBB Serbia for the year ended December 31, 2012 and issued a penalty of €21 million which
has been deferred pending an appeal. In October 2020, the Ministry of Finance annulled this penalty and
instructed the Serbian Tax Authority to restart its investigation. See “Our Business—Legal Proceedings—
_Investigation by the Serbian Tax Authority.”As we operate in more than one tax jurisdiction and may therefore_
incur losses in one jurisdiction that cannot be offset against income earned in a different jurisdiction, we may
pay income taxes in one jurisdiction for a particular period even though on an overall basis we incur a net loss
for that period. In addition, the tax systems in the markets in which we operate are unpredictable, which gives
rise to uncertainties in our tax planning. The occurrence of any of the foregoing tax risks could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_A substantial portion of our assets are represented by goodwill, and we may never realize the full value thereof_**
**_or we may be required to write down the value of our goodwill._**

We have recorded a significant amount of goodwill, including following completion of the Vivacom
Acquisition in July 2020, the Forthnet Acquisition In November 2020, and provisional goodwill as a result of
the Nova Broadcasting Group Acquisition in January 2021. Total goodwill of the Company, which represents
the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets of the businesses we acquire, was €1,229 million, or 28%
of the Company’s total assets, as of March 31, 2021. We perform goodwill impairment testing on an annual
basis, and we incurred impairment losses on goodwill of €0.89 million in the year ended December 31, 2020,
of zero in the year ended December 31, 2019 and of €9.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. A write
down of our goodwill may result from, among other things, deterioration in our performance or a decline in
expected future cash flows. If we were to conclude that a future write down of our goodwill is necessary, we
would be obligated to record the appropriate charge, which could result in a material adverse effect on our
results of operations.

**Risks Related to Our Indebtedness**

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business and prevent us from_**
**_fulfilling our obligations with respect to the New Notes and the Guarantees._**

We are highly leveraged. As of March 31, 2021, the Company had €3,388 million of outstanding indebtedness
on a consolidated basis (excluding lease liabilities). On a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Offering and
the use of proceeds therefrom and the issuance of the New Notes and the other transactions described under
“Capitalization,” as of March 31, 2021, we would have had €3,736 million of outstanding indebtedness on a
consolidated basis. The terms of the Indentures permit the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to incur
substantial additional indebtedness, including in respect of borrowings by the Company and its restricted
subsidiaries under any Credit Facility (as defined in the Indenture) of up to an amount equivalent to the


-----

greater of €570 million and 100% of our Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Indenture) (which Credit
Facility can rank in priority to the New Notes in respect of the recovery of any proceeds from an enforcement
of the Collateral). We also expect to receive commitments for up to €325 million under our Existing Revolving
Credit Facility in connection with the Existing Revolving Credit Facility 2021 Increase, which is expected to
provide additional committed debt funding for us to potentially draw in the future.

The degree to which we will continue to be leveraged following the issuance of the New Notes could have
important consequences to holders of the New Notes, including, but not limited to:

- making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the New Notes and our other
indebtedness and liabilities;

- increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and
industry conditions;

- requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of
principal of, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund
working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures, product research and development or
other general corporate purposes;

- restricting us from pursuing acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities;

- limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive
environment and the industry in which we operate;

- negatively impacting credit terms with our suppliers and other creditors;

- increasing our exposure to interest rate increases because some of our indebtedness bears a floating rate of
interest;

- placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors, to the extent that they are not as
highly leveraged; and

- limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future operations, capital expenditure, business
opportunities, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and increasing the cost of any future
borrowings.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our
debt obligations, including the New Notes.

**_We will be subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future operations and_**
**_capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities._**

The Indentures (including the PIK Indenture, the 2017 Indenture, the 2019 Indenture and the Indenture), the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility and other debt agreements may restrict our ability to:

- incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;

- create or incur certain liens;

- make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions;

- prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity;

- make certain investments;

- create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or advances
to, and on the transfer of, assets to the Issuer or any restricted subsidiary;

- sell, lease or transfer certain assets, including stock of restricted subsidiaries;

- engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

- create unrestricted subsidiaries;

- merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; and

- impair security interests that secure the New Notes.

Our Existing Revolving Credit Facility in addition requires us to comply with a leverage ratio in certain
circumstances. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Existing Revolving Credit Facility


-----

_Agreement.” Our ability to meet this test can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure_
you that we will satisfy this test. A breach of this test could result in a restriction on the ability to make new
drawings under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility. Upon the occurrence of any event of default under our
Existing Revolving Credit Facility, subject to applicable cure periods and other limitations on acceleration or
enforcement, the relevant creditors could cancel the availability of the facilities and elect to declare all amounts
outstanding under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, together with accrued interest, immediately due
and payable. In addition, any default under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility could lead to an event of
default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross default or cross acceleration
provisions, including the Indentures. If our creditors, including the creditors under our Existing Revolving
Credit Facility, accelerate the payment of those amounts, we cannot assure you that our assets and the assets
of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of our
subsidiaries which would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the New Notes, in
full or in part. In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could enforce against any
collateral granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts.

All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the
_New Notes—Certain Covenants.” The covenants to which we are subject could limit our ability to finance_
future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be
in our interests.

**_We will require a significant amount of cash to meet our obligations under our indebtedness and to sustain our_**
**_operations, which we may not be able to generate or raise._**

Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility and our obligations under the New Notes, and to fund our ongoing operations, will
depend on our future performance and our ability to generate cash, which, to a certain extent, is subject to the
success of our business strategy as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, legal, regulatory
and other factors, as well as other factors discussed in these “Risk Factors,” many of which are beyond our
control.

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that currently
anticipated growth, cost savings or efficiencies will be realized or that future debt financing will be available to
us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the New Notes, or to fund our
other liquidity needs. The Existing 2024 SSNs will mature in 2024 and the Existing 2025 FRNs will mature in
2025, the Existing 2026 FRNs will mature in 2026, the Existing 2027 SSNs will mature in 2027, and the
Existing 2028 SSNs will mature in 2028 prior to the New Notes and the Existing PIK Notes issued by Summer
Bidco will mature in 2025. In addition, loans under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized
until June 15, 2025 (which will be automatically reduced to (i) January 1, 2024, if the Existing 2024 SSNs are
not fully refinanced by such date or (ii) January 15, 2025, if the Existing 2025 FRNs are not fully refinanced
by such date). The New Notes offered hereby will mature in 2028. At the respective maturity of the New
Notes and any other debt which we incur, if we do not have sufficient cash flows from operations and other
capital resources to pay our debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs, or we are otherwise restricted
from doing so due to corporate, tax or contractual limitations, we may be required to refinance our
indebtedness. The type, timing and terms of any future financing will depend on our cash needs and the
conditions prevailing in the financial markets. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates
and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business, financial
position and results of operations. If we are unable to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness or obtain
such refinancing on terms acceptable to us, we may be forced to reduce or delay our business activities or
capital expenditures or sell assets or raise additional debt or equity financing in amounts that could be
substantial. There can be no assurance that any assets that we could be required to dispose of could be sold or
that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount of proceeds realized from such sale would be acceptable.
We cannot assure you that we will be able to accomplish any of these measures in a timely manner or on
commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of our Existing Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, the Indentures, other debt agreements and any future agreements may limit our ability to pursue
any of these measures.

Any failure to make required cash payments on the New Notes on a timely basis would likely result in a
reduction of our credit rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness.

**_Despite our current level of indebtedness, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt in the future,_**
**_which may make it difficult for us to service our debt, including the New Notes, and impair our ability to operate_**
**_our businesses._**

We may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Any debt that our subsidiaries incur could be
structurally senior to the New Notes, and other debt could be secured or could mature prior to the New


-----

Notes. In addition to the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations, we may incur
additional indebtedness that is permitted to share in proceeds from enforcement of the Collateral on a super
priority basis. Although the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Indentures contain
restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to significant
qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances the amount of indebtedness that could be
incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to our and our
subsidiaries’ existing debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase. In addition, the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility and the Indentures do not prevent us from incurring obligations or entering other
arrangements that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements, such as qualified receivables
securitization financings.

**_The Existing Floating Rate Notes and the loans under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement bear,_**
**_interest at floating rates that could rise significantly, thereby increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow._**

The Existing Floating Rate Notes and the loans under our Existing Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at
floating rates of interest per annum equal to LIBOR or EURIBOR (as the case may be), as adjusted
periodically, plus a margin. Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed
to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on
commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a
significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. These interest rates could also
rise significantly in the future. To the extent interest rates were to rise significantly, our interest expense
associated with the Existing Floating Rate Notes and debt under our Existing Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement would correspondingly increase, thus reducing our cash flow.

Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR and various government investigations, on September 4,
2019, the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that use of the LIBOR benchmark is expected to
cease after 2021 (the “FCA Announcement”). The FCA Announcement indicates that LIBOR is expected to
be replaced in the United States by Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) and in the UK by Sterling
Overnight Index Average (SONIA). The expected elimination of the LIBOR benchmark, changes in the
manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could
result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or LIBOR is determined, which could require an
adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such
benchmark, including but not limited to the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, whose interest rates are linked
to LIBOR and EURIBOR, or the Existing Floating Rate Notes. Any such change, as well as manipulative
practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or
LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates
of interest.

**_Our hedging and other derivative arrangements may not effectively or sufficiently offset the negative impact of_**
**_interest rate and currency fluctuations._**

We may use a combination of natural hedging techniques and financial derivatives to protect against certain
interest rate risks. We have made use of hedging arrangements to protect our business against interest rate
fluctuations on our local credit facilities and exchange rate fluctuations, and we may continue to make use of
hedging and other derivative arrangements going forward. Although we may enter into and maintain certain
hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of our floating interest rates, there can be no assurances that
hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks,
including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging
arrangements. Such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse
financial impact resulting from foreign currency variations. Gains or losses associated with hedging activities
also may negatively impact operating results.

**Risks Related to the New Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral**

**_Our subsidiaries located in Serbia, as well as other subsidiaries representing a significant portion of our_**
**_revenue and EBITDA, will not guarantee the New Notes, and the New Notes and each of the Guarantees will_**
**_be structurally subordinated to the liabilities and preference shares (if any) of our non-guarantor subsidiaries._**

Generally, claims of creditors of a non-guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, and claims of preferred
or minority shareholders (if any) of the subsidiary, will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of
the subsidiary over the claims of creditors of its parent entity, including claims under any intercompany loans


-----

and claims by holders of the New Notes under the Guarantees. In the event of any foreclosure, dissolution,
winding up, liquidation, reorganization, administration or other bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of any
of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, holders of their indebtedness and their trade creditors will generally be
entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available
for distribution to such subsidiary’s parent entity. As such, the New Notes and each Guarantee will each be
structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade creditors) and preference shareholders (if any) of
our non-guarantor subsidiaries for the New Notes. For the three months ended and as of March 31, 2021,
(i) the Issuer and the Guarantors generated 46% of the Company’s consolidated revenue and 56% of the
Company’s consolidated UG EBITDA, (ii) the Company’s subsidiaries (including the Issuer and the
Guarantors) had a profit for the period of €6 million, compared to a consolidated net loss of €10 million for
the Company and (iii) the Issuer and the Guarantors represented 40% of the Company’s consolidated total
assets (excluding goodwill). The Company’s subsidiaries organized in Serbia, North Macedonia, Croatia,
Montenegro, Malta, Cyprus, Switzerland and Canada, and some of the Company’s subsidiaries organized in
Slovenia, Bulgaria and Greece are not required to guarantee the obligations under the New Notes.

**_Each Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited_**
**_by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability._**

The Guarantors will guarantee the payment of the New Notes on a senior basis. Each Guarantee will provide
the holders of the New Notes with a direct claim against the relevant Guarantor. However, the Indenture
includes language to the effect that each Guarantee and each security interest granted as well as any other
obligation under Security Document will be limited so as to ensure compliance with local law. The Guarantees,
security interests and other obligations will also be subject to applicable corporate and other laws and defenses,
including foreign exchange laws. These laws and defenses may include those that relate to fraudulent
conveyance, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or similar laws
and regulations. In general, these laws prohibit companies from providing financial assistance to anyone for
the purpose of acquiring their shares and limit the circumstances in which companies can transfer economic
benefits to their shareholders outside the payment of properly declared dividends. They also provide for
limitations that affect the rights of creditors generally in case an entity becomes insolvent. See “Limitations on
_Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests” for more details regarding limitations_
on the Guarantees and Security Interests in the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and
Herzegovina and Bulgaria.

While similar laws apply in many jurisdictions, because several of the Guarantors and the substantial majority
of the assets in which security interests are granted are located in CEE countries which have relatively young
capital markets and where courts have limited experience with transactions of the type envisaged by the
offering of the New Notes, there is considerable uncertainty as to how the relevant laws will be applied and
ultimately to what extent the Guarantees and other security interests granted under the Indenture will be
enforceable. For example, while the Slovenian law prohibiting companies from providing financial assistance
to a third-party for the purpose of acquiring its shares applies only to joint stock companies, there is a
significant risk that a court might extend this provision to the acquisition of shares of a joint stock company’s
direct or indirect parents or to limited liability companies. Moreover, the Bosnian legislature adopted rules
prohibiting limited liability companies from providing financial assistance to anyone for the purpose of
acquiring their shares, thereby bringing the applicable legal regime in line with the rules applicable to joint
stock companies. For those reasons, the risk of limitations on enforcement is greater in Slovenia, Serbia,
Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro than in European countries with more established legal systems
and a long history of secured bond offerings.

The Bulgarian limitations on the Guarantees granted by the Vivacom Guarantors and the Vivacom Collateral,
including any thin capitalization and financial assistance issues that might limit the extent of guarantees and
security by certain Vivacom Guarantors are set out in “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the
_Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

Moreover, certain transaction documents are governed by U.S. law. Judgments rendered by a U.S. court will
generally not be directly enforceable in any of the jurisdictions in which the majority of the assets by which the
bonds are secured are located. Instead, in many of these jurisdictions, as a pre-condition to enforcing a U.S.
judgment, a local court will subject the judgment to a multi-factor test. Several of the factors the court will
consider involve a considerable amount of discretion. Even if the court ultimately finds that the judgment is
enforceable, the process may take a lengthy amount of time to complete. For all of these reasons, an investment
in the New Notes involves unique risks that may not apply or apply differently in a more conventional secured


-----

bond offering. If any of these risks materializes, your ability to collect payments of principal and interest
under the New Notes may be materially adversely affected. See “Enforceability of Judgments” for more
information.

**_Other than providing management services, the Issuer is a holding company and depends on distributions from_**
**_its subsidiaries to service and repay the New Notes; certain covenants in our financing arrangements and other_**
**_agreements may limit the availability of operating cash flow to the Issuer._**

Other than providing management services, the Issuer is a holding company and conducts its operations
principally through, and derives its revenues principally from, its subsidiaries. The ability of the Issuer’s
subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions or payments to the Issuer will be subject to the
availability of profits or funds for such purpose which, in turn, will depend on the future performance of the
subsidiary concerned which, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive,
legislative, regulatory and other factors that may be beyond its control. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries
are subject to restrictions on the making of such distributions contained in their other financing arrangements,
and such financing arrangements may actually prohibit the ability of these subsidiaries to move cash within
the restricted group. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.” Applicable law may also limit the
amounts that some of our subsidiaries are permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity
interests, or even prevent such payments. The Issuer’s subsidiaries (other than the Guarantors) will have no
obligation to make payments with respect to the New Notes. Applicable tax laws and regulations may also
subject such payments to further taxation. There can be no assurance that our subsidiaries will generate
sufficient profits or cash flow from operations or that alternative sources of financing will be available at any
time in an amount sufficient to enable these subsidiaries to service their indebtedness and to fund their other
liquidity needs and also make payments to the Issuer sufficient to allow all cash payment obligations under
the New Notes to be met.

**_The New Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that has been granted as_**
**_security for the New Notes and future secured indebtedness may be secured by certain assets that do not secure_**
**_the New Notes; in the event that the Collateral is enforced, the lenders under the Existing Revolving Credit_**
**_Facility, counterparties of certain hedging obligations and creditors for other super priority indebtedness will_**
**_be paid with the proceeds from the enforcement of Collateral in priority to the holders of the New Notes._**

The New Notes will be secured by the Collateral no later than at the times described herein, and initially the
New Notes will not be secured by all the Collateral. If an event of default occurs and the obligations under the
New Notes are accelerated, the New Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral
underlying their security interest at such time. The Issuer, the Company and its restricted subsidiaries may
incur additional indebtedness in the future, which may also be secured by the relevant Collateral. If the value
of the Collateral is less than the value of the claims of the holders of the New Notes together with the claims
of the other secured creditors, those claims may not be satisfied in full. The Existing Notes and the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility are secured, and the New Notes will be secured, with certain assets of the Company
and the Company’s restricted subsidiaries. The Indenture allows the Company and its restricted subsidiaries
to secure additional indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the Indenture (which may be structurally
senior to the New Notes) with the property and assets of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries that do
not secure the New Notes. The amount of indebtedness and the value of such assets and property could be
significant.

No appraisals of the Collateral have been prepared by us or on our behalf in connection with the offering of
the New Notes. The fair market value of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include,
among others, our ability to implement our business strategy, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly
sale, general economic conditions, the availability of buyers, whether or not the business is sold as a going
concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale and similar factors. The amount to be received
upon a sale of any Collateral would be dependent on numerous factors, including but not limited to the actual
fair market value of the Collateral at such time, general, market and economic conditions and the timing and
the manner of the sale. There also can be no assurance that the Collateral will be saleable and, even if saleable,
the timing of any liquidation or foreclosure is uncertain and there could be substantial delays. Industry
regulations in certain jurisdictions in which we operate include restrictions on persons who may hold certain
of our licenses, authorizations and consents that are necessary to operate our business. In the event of
foreclosure, the transfer of our business operations may be prohibited or only permitted to a limited group of
investors eligible to hold such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, entry into
the security documents, enforcement of the Collateral and any transfer of our operations may require, in
certain jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings or might otherwise be


-----

challenged. Such consents, approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a
result, enforcement may be delayed, and the value of the Collateral may be significantly decreased.

To the extent that liens, rights or easements granted to third parties encumber assets located on property
owned by us, such third parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject
to such liens that could adversely affect the value of the security and the ability of the relevant Security Agent
to realize or foreclose on the security. By the nature of our business, some or all of the Collateral may be
illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. In the event that a bankruptcy case is commenced
by or against us, if the value of the Collateral is less than the amount of principal and accrued and unpaid
interest on the New Notes and other obligations secured by the same Collateral, interest may cease to accrue
on such New Notes from and after the date the bankruptcy petition is filed. In the event of a foreclosure,
liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, we cannot assure you that the proceeds from any sale or
liquidation of the Collateral will be sufficient to pay the obligations due under such New Notes.

With respect to any shares pledged to secure the New Notes, including the shares of the Issuer and certain
Guarantors, such shares may also have limited value in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar
proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity
whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged
entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of
value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of this Collateral may decline over time. If the
proceeds of the relevant Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the New Notes, the holders
of such New Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) generally would
have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the remaining assets of the Issuer and the
Guarantors.

The Indenture also permits the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of the New
Notes on the relevant Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness or third parties
enjoy liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Indenture or the security documents,
such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral which, if exercised,
could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the New Notes. Moreover, if we issue
additional notes under the Indenture, holders of such additional notes would benefit from the same collateral
as the holders of the New Notes being offered hereby, thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on
the Collateral.

The security interests in the Collateral and any additional security interests granted in the future are subject to
certain agreed security principles applicable to such Collateral and the Existing Intercreditor Agreement.
These agreed security principles set forth limitations on the requirement to grant security interests in favor of
the New Notes in certain circumstances and may result in recoveries from security interests being limited or
security not being granted at all over particular types or classes of assets.

Furthermore, the Existing Intercreditor Agreement provides that proceeds from the enforcement of the
Collateral will be applied to repay claims of the lenders under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and
creditors of other priority indebtedness in priority to the holders of the New Notes and other secured
obligations. Holders of the New Notes may therefore receive less from the proceeds of the Collateral in an
enforcement or insolvency scenario than if they were not required to share the proceeds.

**_Holders of the New Notes will not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral._**

The New Notes will generally be secured by the same Collateral securing the obligations under our Existing
Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations and the 2017 Indenture, the 2019 Indenture and the
Indenture. We can incur significant additional indebtedness and other obligations that may be secured by the
same Collateral under the terms of the Indenture.

The Existing Intercreditor Agreement provides that the agent of the creditor class who wishes to deliver an
enforcement instruction must first consult with every agent or representative of the other creditor classes,
certain creditors and the Security Agent for a period of not less than 30 days. After an initial consultation
period, the Security Agent may act upon the instructions of an instructing group, which may be holders of
66[2]∕3% of the aggregate principal amount of the New Notes outstanding or creditors of 66[2]∕3% of the
aggregate principal amount of super senior indebtedness (which includes drawn and undrawn commitments
under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility). To the extent there are conflicting instructions, those on behalf
of holders of the New Notes will prevail. However, in certain circumstances the creditors under the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility and any future counterparties to certain hedging arrangements and other


-----

indebtedness secured by the Collateral in priority to the New Notes will have control over enforcement of the
Collateral, including if (i) such creditors have not been fully repaid within six months of the end of the first 30
day consultation period, (ii) the Security Agent has not commenced any enforcement action within
three-months of the end of the first 30 day consultation period or (iii) an insolvency event has occurred and
the Security Agent has not commenced any enforcement action.

These arrangements could result in the enforcement of the Collateral in a manner that results in lower
recoveries by holders of the New Notes. Furthermore, other creditors not subject to the Existing Intercreditor
Agreement could have interests that differ from the interests of holders of the New Notes and may elect to
commence enforcement action against the Company or its subsidiaries at a time when it would be
disadvantageous for the holders of the New Notes to do so. In addition, the Company or one or more of its
subsidiaries could seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws, or the value of certain Collateral could
otherwise be impaired, reduced or eliminated in value due to delays in enforcement.

If the Security Agent sells Collateral comprising the shares of any of the Company’s subsidiaries as a result of
an enforcement action in accordance with the Existing Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the New Notes
and the Guarantees and the liens over any other assets securing the New Notes and the Guarantees may be
released. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Existing Intercreditor Agreement” and
“Description of the New Notes—Security—Release of Liens.”

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the New Notes under which the Collateral_**
**_securing the New Notes and the Guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent_**
**_of the Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the Guarantees and the Collateral securing the New Notes will be released
automatically. See “Description of the New Notes—Notes Guarantees”and “Description of the New Notes—
Security—Release of Liens.” In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral comprising the shares of the
Issuer or any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Existing
Intercreditor Agreement, then claims under the New Notes and the Guarantees may be released or transferred.
See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Existing Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of
_the New Notes—Security—Release of Liens.” Your ability to recover on the New Notes could be materially_
_impaired in such circumstances._

**_The Issuer and the Guarantors will have control over certain of the Collateral; the operation of the business or_**
**_the sale of particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the New Notes._**

The Security Documents will allow the Issuer and the Guarantors to remain in possession of, retain exclusive
control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from certain of the Collateral. So
long as no default or event of default under the Indenture would result therefrom, the Issuer and the
Guarantors may, among other things, subject to the terms of the security documents, without any release or
consent by the Trustee or the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral
such as selling, modifying, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of the Collateral and making
ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of indebtedness. Any of these activities could reduce
the value of the Collateral, which could reduce the amounts payable to you from the proceeds of any sale of
such Collateral in the case of an enforcement of the liens on the New Notes.

**_Your rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the delay in or failure to grant or perfect security_**
**_interests in the Collateral._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected, and its priority
retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party or the grantor of the security, as applicable.
The liens on the relevant Collateral securing the New Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of
the New Notes if we or the Security Agent, fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of
these liens or if it has been agreed that such perfection steps shall not be taken on the basis that such steps have
undesirable effects. Furthermore, applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the
grant of a general security interest, such as real property, equipment subject to a certificate and certain
proceeds, can only be perfected at or promptly following the time such property and rights are acquired and
identified.

The Issuer and the Guarantors have limited obligations to assist the Security Agent in perfecting the security
interest of the holders of the New Notes in specified Collateral. There can be no assurance that the Security
Agent will monitor, or that the Issuer will inform the Security Agent of, the future acquisition of property and


-----

rights that should constitute Collateral, and that the necessary action will be taken to properly create and
perfect the security interest in such property and rights acquired after the Issue Date. The Security Agent has
no obligation or responsibility to perfect the security interests in Collateral or to monitor the acquisition of
additional property or rights that should constitute Collateral or the creation or perfection of any security
interest. The failure to create or perfect such additional security interests may adversely affect the relevant
security interest and/or the priority of such security interest in favor of the New Notes.

**_The granting of security interests in the Collateral in connection with the issuance of the New Notes may_**
**_create hardening periods for such security interests in accordance with the law applicable in certain jurisdictions._**

The release of existing security interests in the Collateral which secure the Existing Notes, and the granting of
new security interests in such Collateral in connection with the issuance of the New Notes offered hereby or
additional notes in the future may create direct or indirect hardening or voidance periods as applicable for
such security interests in certain jurisdictions. The applicable hardening or voidance period for these new
security interests may run from the moment such security interests are extended and perfected with respect to
the New Notes or, if later, the issuance of such New Notes. At each time, if the security interest granted,
perfected, extended or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the applicable hardening or voidance
period, it may be declared void and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. In addition, the granting of shared
security interests to secure existing and new indebtedness or future indebtedness, as the case may be, may
restart or reopen hardening periods in certain jurisdictions in particular because the Indenture permits the
release and retaking of security granted in favor of the New Notes in certain circumstances including in
connection with the incurrence of future debt. If the grantor of such security interests were to become subject
to a bankruptcy or winding up proceeding after the Issue Date, any mortgage or security interest in the
Collateral delivered after the Issue Date would face a greater risk than security interests in place as of the
Issue Date of being avoided by the grantor or by its trustee, receiver, liquidator, administrator or similar
authority, or otherwise set aside by a court, as a preference under insolvency law. See “Limitations on Validity
_and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

**_Upon an IPO Pushdown, certain Guarantees and Collateral may be released, and any retaken Collateral may_**
**_be subject to hardening periods._**

Under certain circumstances, we may undertake an IPO Pushdown. See “Description of the New Notes—IPO
_Pushdown.” Upon consummation of the IPO Pushdown (as defined in “Description of the New Notes”),_
references to the Company and Restricted Subsidiaries (and all related provisions) in the Indenture shall apply
only to the IPO Pushdown Entity (as defined in “Description of the New Notes”) and its Restricted Subsidiaries
from time to time, although the Issuer shall remain the same entity. Upon such substitution, each Holding
Company (as defined in “Description of the New Notes”) of the IPO Pushdown Entity will be irrevocably and
unconditionally released from all obligations under the Indenture and the Existing Intercreditor Agreement
and any Guarantees or security granted by such Holding Company in respect of the Indenture and the New
Notes will be released. In such a case, new security documents in respect of the Collateral to be retaken and
that will remain in place following an IPO Pushdown, including the pledge of the shares of the Issuer, may
need to be executed and be subject to new hardening periods.

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the New Notes._**

The Collateral securing the New Notes will be subject to defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections
permitted under the Indenture and the Existing Intercreditor Agreement. The existence of any such
exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the
Collateral securing the New Notes, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such
Collateral. Furthermore, the ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including,
among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or re characterization under
the laws of certain jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that the assets comprising the Collateral are, or
will be, free and clear from third-party prior ranking security rights or other interests, such as security interests
arising under standard contract terms or by operation of law. Any such rights or interests would adversely
affect the value of the Collateral and the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose such Collateral.

The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the
realization of security interests in Collateral. The Security Agent may also need to obtain the consent of a
third-party to enforce a security interest in certain jurisdictions. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent
will be able to obtain any such consent. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will
be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have
the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may decline significantly.


-----

**_Enforcement of the Collateral across multiple jurisdictions may be difficult._**

The Collateral will be governed by the laws of multiple jurisdictions. In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or
a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions. Accordingly, the rights under the
Collateral will be subject to the laws of the respective jurisdiction, and it may be difficult to effectively enforce
such rights in multiple bankruptcies, insolvency and other similar proceedings. Moreover, such multijurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly for creditors and often result in substantial
uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors’rights. The application of these various laws in multiple
jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdictions’ law should apply and could adversely affect the
ability to enforce the security and to realize any recovery under the New Notes and the Guarantees. See also
“Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”

**_The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to you. The_**
**_ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted by local law._**

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the New Notes and
the obligations of the Guarantors under the Guarantees will not be granted directly to the holders of the New
Notes but will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent. The Indenture provides, and the Existing
Intercreditor Agreement provides, that only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the Security
Documents. As a consequence, holders of the New Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be
entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the New Notes, except through the
Trustee, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent in
respect of the Collateral.

In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests in the Collateral is subject to
mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral are taken.
For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for an appropriation of certain pledged assets,
but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some uncertainty
under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the New Notes that
are not identified as registered holders in a security document will be validly secured and/or can be enforced.
This area of law is untested in the courts of certain of the relevant jurisdictions. In certain jurisdictions, due to
the laws and jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests (and in particular, the
requirements of accessority where the validity, extent and enforceability of security is linked to (i.e., is
accessory to) the secured claim) and the enforceability of such security interests, the security agent and/or
trustee is not able to hold the benefit of security on behalf of a group of creditors.

Under Dutch law, and laws of certain other jurisdictions (including Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina), it
is uncertain as to whether security interests can be granted to a party other than the creditor of the claim
which is purported to be secured by such security interests. As a consequence, the Existing Intercreditor
Agreement provides for the creation of parallel debt (“Parallel Debt”) obligations in favor of the Security
Agent mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and Guarantors towards the holders of the New Notes under or
in connection with the Existing Intercreditor Agreement (the “Principal Obligations”). The Dutch law security
interests are granted to the Security Agent as security for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the
Principal Obligations. As a result, the holders of the New Notes will bear some risks associated with a possible
insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. In relation to the security interests located in other
jurisdictions, the Security Agent might be appointed as joint and several creditor of secured obligations,
including the Parallel Debt claim. The parallel debt construct has not been tested under laws of certain of the
Guarantors’ jurisdictions, including (without limitation) Dutch law and Slovenian law and, to the extent that
the security interests in the Collateral created to secure the Parallel Debt are successfully challenged by other
parties, holders of the New Notes will not be entitled to demand performance as holders of the secured claim
and will not (directly) receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the relevant
Collateral.

**_The insolvency and administrative laws of the Netherlands and the respective jurisdictions of incorporation of_**
**_the Guarantors or future guarantors of the New Notes may not be as favorable to you as the U.S. bankruptcy_**
**_laws or the laws of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar and may preclude holders of the New_**
**_Notes from recovering payments due on the New Notes._**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, and the Guarantors are incorporated under the
laws of various jurisdictions, including the laws of the Netherlands, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Luxembourg and Bulgaria. In the event that the Issuer, the Guarantors, any future guarantors, any future
guarantees of the New Notes, if any, or any other of our subsidiaries experienced financial difficulty, it is not


-----

possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would
be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Guarantees and Collateral provided by entities organized
in jurisdictions not discussed in this offering memorandum are also subject to material limitations pursuant to
their terms, by statute or otherwise. Any enforcement of the Guarantees or the security for the New Notes
after bankruptcy or an insolvency event in such other jurisdictions will be subject to the insolvency laws of the
relevant entity’s jurisdiction of organization or other jurisdictions. The insolvency and other laws of each of
these jurisdictions may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other, including in the areas of
rights of secured and other creditors, the ability to void preferential transfers, priority of governmental and
other creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceedings and preference
periods. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether, and to
what extent, the laws of any particular jurisdiction’s laws should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce
your rights under the Guarantees, any future guarantees of the New Notes or the Collateral in these
jurisdictions and limit any amounts that you may receive.

**_Insolvency laws and other limitations on the Guarantees and the security that secures the New Notes may_**
**_adversely affect their validity and enforceability._**

Our obligations under the New Notes will be guaranteed by, and secured by certain assets of, the Guarantors
or their shares. The Guarantors are organized or incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia and Bulgaria. Although laws differ among these jurisdictions,
in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance laws, equitable principles and insolvency laws and
limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions could limit
the enforceability of the Guarantee and the security against a Guarantor or Collateral provider. Courts may
also in certain circumstances avoid the security interest or the Guarantee where the Collateral provider is close
to, or in the vicinity of, insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency
law, although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the
relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes. See “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests” and “Enforceability of Judgments” for more_
_information._

In insolvency proceedings, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors, the Collateral providers or the
appointed insolvency administrator may challenge the Guarantees and security, and intercompany obligations
generally, as preferences, transaction at an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or
on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to:

- void or invalidate all or a portion of an Guarantor’s obligations under its guarantee or the security interests
provided by the Issuer or such Guarantor;

- direct that the Issuer and/or the holders of the New Notes return any amounts paid under a guarantee or
any security document to the relevant Guarantor or to the respective Collateral provider or to a fund for the
benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors or the Collateral provider; and

- take other action that is detrimental to holders of the New Notes.

If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the New Notes and any Guarantee or security interest is found to
be a preference, transaction at an undervalue, invalid charge, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise
set aside, we cannot assure the holders of the New Notes that we can ever repay in full any amounts
outstanding under the New Notes. In addition, the liability of each Guarantor under its guarantee of the
New Notes and the liability of each Collateral provider will be limited to the amount that will result in such
guarantee or security interest not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or
otherwise being set aside. The amount recoverable from a Guarantor or a Collateral provider under the
security documents will also be limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what methodology a court
would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor or each Collateral
provider and whether a court would give effect to such attempted limitation. Also, there is a possibility that
the entire guarantee or security interest may be set aside, in which case, the Guarantor’s or Collateral provider’s
entire liability may be extinguished.

In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts would
likely, for example, need to find that, at the time the security interests were created, the Collateral provider:

- issued such security interest with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding current or future creditors
or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or created such security after its insolvency;


-----

- created such security interest in a situation where a prudent business person as a shareholder of such
Collateral provider would have contributed equity to such Collateral provider or where the relevant
beneficiary of the security interest knew or should have known that the Collateral provider was insolvent or
a filing for insolvency had been made; or

- received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the security interest on
the basis that the security interest were incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly the Collateral provider’s
benefit, or on some other basis and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the creation of the
security interest, or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons, (ii) was engaged, or was about to
engage, in a business transaction for which the Collateral provider’s assets were unreasonably small or
(iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as and
when they would become due.

Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor or Collateral provider generally
may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a guarantee or created any security
if:

- its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets;

- it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due (and it is unable to get further credit); or

- the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts and
liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute.

We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor or a Collateral
provider was “insolvent” as of the date the Guarantees were issued or security was created or that, regardless
of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that the Issuer, a Collateral provider or a Guarantor
was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor, the
Issuer or a Collateral provider was insolvent on the date the respective guarantee was issued or security interest
was created, that payments to holders of the New Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

For an overview of certain insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the Guarantees and the
security interests, see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”

**_The interests of our shareholders may conflict with the interests of the holders of the New Notes._**

BC Partners, along with certain co-investors, indirectly owns an approximate 56% stake in the Issuer. Our
shareholders have and will continue to have, directly or indirectly, the power to affect our legal and capital
structure, as well as the ability to elect and change our management and to approve other changes to our
operations and to control the outcome of matters requiring action by shareholders. The interests of our
shareholders may conflict with the interests of holders of the New Notes, particularly if we encounter financial
difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. Investment funds advised by BC Partners are in the
business of making investments in companies and may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestiture
(including one or more divestitures of all or part of our business or sales of our shares which would result in
changes to our shareholding structure), dividend distributions, financing or other transactions that, in their
judgment, could enhance their equity investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to you as
holders of the New Notes. In addition, our majority shareholder may pursue acquisition opportunities that
are complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.
Conversely, our shareholders may have an interest in not pursuing acquisitions, divestitures and other
transactions that could enhance our cash flow and be beneficial to you. Moreover, investment funds advised
by BC Partners may, from time to time, acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly, or
indirectly, with us. See “Principal Shareholders.”

**_The interests of holders of the New Notes and the interests of holders of a series of additional notes under the_**
**_Indenture may be inconsistent._**

The New Notes and any other additional notes issued under the Indenture will be issued pursuant to a single
Indenture and will vote as a single class with respect to amendments, waivers or other modifications of the
Indenture other than with respect to amendments, waivers or other modifications that will only affect the
New Notes or such additional notes. Subject to certain restrictions, further series of additional notes may be
issued under the Indenture which have different terms in respect of currency, interest rate and certain other
matters. Such additional notes will also generally vote as a single class with other series of notes issued under
the Indenture but may have interests that differ from the interests of holders of other series of notes issued


-----

under the Indenture, including the New Notes. The New Notes and the Existing Fixed Rate Notes bear
interest at a fixed rate, and the Existing Floating Rate Notes bear interest at a floating rate, and such notes
have, or will have, among other things, different interest rates, different maturities, call schedules and call
protection from each other and other features that may differ from additional notes issued under the Indenture
in the future. As a result of these differences, the interests of holders of the New Notes and the interests of
holders of additional notes could conflict. In addition, the holders of New Notes may be in a position to agree
to certain terms in a consent solicitation that would be beneficial to such series of New Notes but adverse to
the economic interest of the other series of notes issued under the Indenture; however, to the extent the
relevant amendment or waiver is approved by the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
New Notes then outstanding under the Indenture (subject to the limited exceptions), all holders of Notes
under the Indenture will be bound by such amendment.

**_You may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuer and all of the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries are organized outside the United States.
All of the directors and executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors are non-residents of the United
States and substantially all of their assets are located outside of the United States. Although the Issuer and
the Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action
under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on our
directors and executive officers located outside the United States. In addition, as the assets of the Issuer and
certain of the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries and those of their directors and executive officers
are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in the U.S. courts
against them. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuer and the
Guarantors may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United
States.

Additionally, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of foreign jurisdictions would enforce (i) judgments
of United States courts obtained against the Issuer and the Issuer’s managing directors who are not residents
of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the United States federal and state
securities laws or (ii) in original actions brought in such foreign jurisdictions against us or such persons
predicated upon the United States federal and state securities laws.

The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of
judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters, with The Netherlands. For
further information see “Enforceability of Judgments.”

**_Investors in the New Notes may have limited recourse against our independent auditors._**

Investors in the New Notes offered hereby should understand that statements may be made by the independent
auditors whose reports are included in this Offering Memorandum which may be intended to disclaim any
liability to parties (such as purchasers of the New Notes) other than to the Company with respect to reports
relating to the financial statements of the Company. The SEC would not permit such limiting language to be
included in a registration statement or a prospectus used in connection with an offering of securities registered
under the Securities Act, or in a report filed under the Exchange Act. If a U.S. court (or any other court) were
to give effect to such language, the recourse that investors in the New Notes may have against the independent
auditors based on their reports or the consolidated financial statements to which they relate could be limited.
The extent to which auditors have responsibility or liability to third parties is unclear under the laws of many
jurisdictions, and the legal effect of these statements in their reports may be untested in the context of an
offering of securities. The inclusion of such language, however, may limit the ability of holders of the New
Notes to bring any action against our auditors for damages arising out of an investment in the New Notes.

**_The transfer of the New Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect their liquidity and the price at_**
**_which they may be sold._**

Because the New Notes have not been, and will not be, and are not required to be, registered under the
Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, they may not be offered or sold in the United
States except to QIBs in accordance with Rule 144A, to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in
accordance with Regulation S or pursuant to another exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the
registration requirements of the Securities Act and all other applicable laws. See “Transfer Restrictions.”These
restrictions may limit the ability of investors to resell the New Notes. It is the obligation of holders of the New
Notes to ensure that their offers and sales of the New Notes within the United States and other countries
comply with applicable securities laws.


-----

**_The New Notes will initially be held in book-entry form and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the_**
**_relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The New Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through Euroclear and
Clearstream and will trade in book-entry form.

Unless and until definitive New Notes (each a “Definitive Registered Note”) are issued in exchange for bookentry interests in the Global Notes (which will only occur in very limited circumstances), owners of the bookentry interests will not be considered owners or holders of New Notes. The common depositary (or its
nominee) for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the Global Notes
representing the New Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the
Global Notes will be made to the Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream.
Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the
Global Notes. After payment to Euroclear and Clearstream, the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee and the
Paying Agent will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to
the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest, you must rely on the
procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and if you are not a participant in Euroclear or
Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights
and obligations of a holder under the relevant indenture. See “Book-entry; Delivery and Form.”

Unlike registered holders of the New Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the
direct right to act upon our solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from registered
holders of the New Notes. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the
extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear or Clearstream or, if applicable, from a
participant. We cannot assure you that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be
sufficient to enable you to vote on any requested actions on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until Definitive
Registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be
restricted to acting through Euroclear or Clearstream. We cannot assure you that the procedures to be
implemented through Euroclear or Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under
the New Notes.

**_There may not be an active trading market for the New Notes, in which case your ability to sell the New Notes_**
**_may be limited._**

The New Notes will be new securities for which there will be no established trading market. Accordingly, we
cannot assure you as to:

- the liquidity of any market in the New Notes;

- your ability to sell your New Notes; or

- the prices at which you would be able to sell your New Notes.

Future trading prices for the New Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things,
prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for
non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the
prices of securities similar to the New Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the New Notes may be
adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that
may cause volatility in prices. The trading market for the New Notes may attract different investors and this
may affect the extent to which the New Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for the New Notes will
be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the New
Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. As a result, there is no assurance that there will
be an active trading market for the New Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to
resell your holding of the New Notes at a fair value, if at all.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the New Notes after completing
the Offering. However, they have no obligation to do so and may discontinue market making activities at any
time without notice. In addition, such market making activity will be subject to limitations imposed by the
Securities Act and other applicable laws and regulations. As a result, there may not be an active trading
market for the New Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your New Notes
at a fair value, if at all.


-----

**_The New Notes may not become or remain listed on the Official List of the Exchange._**

Although application will be made to the Authority for the listing of and permission to deal in the New Notes
on the Official List of the Exchange, we cannot assure you that the New Notes will become or remain listed.
If the Issuer cannot maintain the listing on the Exchange and the admission to dealing on the Official List
thereof, or if it becomes unduly burdensome to make or maintain such listing, the Issuer may cease to make or
maintain such listing on the Official List of the Exchange. Listing of any of the New Notes on the Official List
of the Exchange does not imply that a public offering of any of the New Notes in Guernsey has been
authorized. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the New Notes as a result of the listing on
the Official List of the Exchange or another recognized listing exchange for comparable issuers, failure to be
approved for listing or the delisting (whether or not for an alternative admission to listing on another stock
exchange) of the New Notes, as applicable, from the Official List of the Exchange may have a material effect
on a holder’s ability to resell the New Notes, as applicable, in the secondary market.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject_**
**_to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the New Notes and/or the New
Notes (or make a public statement about an existing credit rating). The credit ratings address our ability to
perform our obligations under the terms of the New Notes and credit risks in determining the likelihood that
payments will be made when due under the New Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all
risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed herein and other factors that may affect
the value of the New Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be
subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that
a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or
withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A
suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the New Notes by one or
more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financing and
could adversely affect the value and trading of such New Notes.

**_We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the New Notes upon_**
**_the occurrence of a change of control as required by the Indenture and the change of control provision_**
**_contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate_**
**_events. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may have the right to purchase all outstanding_**
**_Notes in connection with a tender offer, even if certain holders do not consent to the tender._**

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a “change of control” under the Indenture, the Issuer will
be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the
principal amount thereof on the date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but not including) the
date of repurchase. If a change of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient
funds available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase
price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in our Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement,
the Existing Intercreditor Agreement or our other existing contractual obligations would allow us to make
such required repurchases. A change of control may result in an event of default under, or require the
repayment of or result in an acceleration of, our Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and other
indebtedness. The repurchase of the New Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such
indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from its
subsidiaries to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the New Notes following the occurrence of a change of
control may be limited by our then existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available when
necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a change of control occurs at a time
when we are prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the New Notes, we
may seek the consent of the holders or lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the New Notes or
may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such
borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we
expect that we would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the New Notes upon the
occurrence of a change of control, and we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such financing
or that such financing would be on acceptable terms.

Any failure by the Issuer to offer to repurchase any of the New Notes if so required would constitute a default
under the Indenture, which could, in turn, constitute a default under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, the PIK Indenture and certain other indebtedness. See “Description of the New Notes—Change of
_Control.”_


-----

The change of control provisions contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the
event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization
or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not
involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “change of
control” as defined in the Indenture. Except as described under “Description of the New Notes—Change of
_Control.” the Indenture does not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or_
redeem the New Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar
transaction.

Furthermore, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of control under the
Indenture will be deemed not to be a change of control if the consolidated leverage ratio is less than a certain
specified level. See “Description of the New Notes—Certain Definitions—Specified Change of Control Event.”

In addition, in connection with certain tender offers for the New Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in
aggregate principal amount of the applicable outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such
Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third-party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer,
purchases, all of the relevant Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such
third-party will have the right to redeem the New Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part,
following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to other holders of Notes. See “Description of the
_New Notes—Optional Redemption.”_

**_The term “all or substantially all” in the context of a change of control has no clearly established meaning_**
**_under relevant law and is subject to judicial interpretation such that it may not be certain that a change of control_**
**_has occurred or will occur._**

The definition of “Change of Control” in the Indenture includes (with certain exceptions) a disposition of all
or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any
person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is
no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law, varies according to the facts and
circumstances of the subject transaction and is subject to judicial interpretation. Accordingly, in certain
circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a
disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a
whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is
required to make an offer to repurchase the New Notes.

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the New Notes._**

The New Notes will be denominated and payable in euros. If investors measure their investment returns by
reference to a currency other than euros, an investment in the New Notes will entail foreign exchange related
risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro relative to the currency
by reference to which investors measure the return on their investments because of economic, political and
other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the euro against the currency by reference to
which investors measure the return on their investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the
New Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on the New
Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which the investors measure the return on their
investments. Investments in the New Notes, which are denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars, by
U.S. Holders (as defined in “Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”) may also
have important tax consequences as a result of foreign exchange gains or losses, if any. See “Tax
_Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.”_

**_Holders of the New Notes may have adverse tax consequences in the event of an IPO Pushdown._**

Under certain circumstances, we may undertake an IPO Pushdown (as described under “Description of the
_New Notes—IPO Pushdown”). Upon consummation of the IPO Pushdown references to the Company and_
the Restricted Subsidiaries (and all related provisions) in the Indenture shall apply only to the IPO Pushdown
Entity and its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time, although the Issuer shall remain the same entity. In
such event, each holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity would be released from its obligations under
the Indenture. Such a modification to the terms of the New Notes could be treated for U.S. federal income tax
purposes as a deemed exchange of (i) the New Notes as in place prior to such modifications for (ii) modified
New Notes as in place after such modifications (“Modified Notes”). If such modifications resulted in a
deemed exchange, such a deemed exchange could be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income
tax purposes in which certain beneficial owners of the New Notes could be required to recognize gain or loss.


-----

Furthermore, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Modified Notes deemed issued in such a deemed
exchange could be treated as issued with original issue discount (“OID”). In such event, U.S. Holders (as
defined under “Certain Tax Consequences—Certain U.S. federal income tax considerations”) would be required
to include that original issue discount in their income as it accrues, in advance of the receipt of cash
corresponding to such income. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the U.S. federal
income tax considerations relating to modification of the New Notes in connection with the IPO Pushdown,
including the U.S. federal income tax considerations of a deemed exchange and resulting OID, if any.

(a) Vivacom financial information has been derived from Note 30 to the Vivacom Unaudited Interim Financial Statements.
Financial information for the seven months ended July 31, 2020 is derived by taking the financial data for nine months ended
September 30, 2020, and subtracting the financial information for the two months ended September 30, 2020 (which has not
been reviewed or audited). The financial information is prepared in Bulgarian levs (BGN).

(b) Amounts were converted using the BGN/EUR exchange rate of BGN 1.9558 to EUR 1.00, the pegged rate for the period.

(c) The adjustments presented have been made to reclassify Vivacom line items to conform to the Company’s basis of
preparation. Such adjustments have no effect on profit for the period reported.

(d) The purpose of the adjustment is to illustrate the effects of:

(i) eliminating the effect of transactions between Vivacom and Viva Telecom Bulgaria EOOD

The Group acquired Viva Telecom Bulgaria EOOD (formerly, Viva Telecom Bulgaria OOD) in the Vivacom Acquisition.
Viva Telecom Bulgaria EOOD is a holding company of the Vivacom Group but does not itself prepare consolidated financial
information. The pro forma financial information of Vivacom included herein is based on the Vivacom Unaudited Interim
Financial Statements and therefore certain adjustments are made to eliminate the effect of transactions between Vivacom
and Viva Telecom Bulgaria EOOD. An adjustment was made to eliminate intercompany transactions, comprising an interest
income amounting to €6,262 thousand and reversal of impairment cost amounting to €303 thousand and related tax effects.

(ii) purchase price allocation

The purchase price allocation was finalized as of December 31, 2020 and therefore the Company Audited Financial
Statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, include the fair value adjustments that have been made to acquired assets
and liabilities (including any associated deferred tax effects), and differences between total consideration paid for the
acquisition and the estimated fair values of the net assets of Vivacom were recorded as goodwill. The Company identified
and measured significant identifiable assets such as: trade name, customer base—fixed services, customer base—mobile
services, licenses, software and distribution network. The value of the items of property, plant and equipment and intangible
assets increased significantly. As a result of the newly identified intangible assets and the significant increase to the value of
the existing items of property, plant and equipment, additional amortization and depreciation charges were estimated and
added as adjustments to the of Vivacom financial data for the seven months ended July 31, 2020. The amount of additional
amortization and depreciation was estimated based on the value allocated to specific assets and the remaining useful life of


-----

those assets. The adjustments for the additional amortization and depreciation charges are amounting to €44,382 thousand
and related tax benefit amounting to €4,438 thousand.

(e) The adjustments presented have been made to align Vivacom’s accounting policies with IFRS as adopted and applied by the
Company under its currently applied accounting policies. Vivacom (i) capitalizes subscriber acquisition costs for contracts
below one year and (ii) capitalizes portability costs, while such costs are expensed as incurred by the Company and (iii) for
related tax effects of the foregoing.

(3) Represents adjustments relating to refinancing calculated as follows:

**Financing adjustments . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **13,952**

The senior secured notes related to the 2020 Notes Financing were issued on February 6, 2020. For the purposes of the Unaudited
Pro Forma Financial Information, additional interest for the period from January 1, 2020 to the 2020 Notes Issue Date was
calculated using the effective interest rates attributable to this financing.

The remaining adjustments relate to reversal of costs included in the historical financial information of the Company and of
Vivacom attributable to financing that was repaid from the proceeds of the 2020 Notes Financing.

(4) Adjusted Capital Expenditure represents capital expenditure as adjusted by intragroup adjustments, adjustments related to the
timing of recognition of additions of assets and overflow between periods. Adjusted capital expenditure is prepared on the basis of
management accounts and not IFRS. Reconciliation of capital expenditure as derived from financial statements to Adjusted Capital
Expenditure is as follows:

**Year Ended**

(a) Vivacom financial data was derived from Vivacom’s accounting records in BGN and converted to EUR using the BGN/EUR
exchange rate of BGN 1.9558 to EUR 1.00.

(b) Capital expenditure includes increases in right of use assets recognized under IFRS 16.

(5) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental measures of financial performance that are not required by, or presented in
accordance with, IFRS. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not a measurement of performance or liquidity under IFRS and you
should not consider EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to (a) net income (as determined in accordance with IFRS as
a measure of our operating performance), (b) cash flow for the period as a measure of our ability to meet our cash needs, or (c) any
other measure of performance or liquidity under IFRS. We present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and the ratios derived
therefrom, because we believe that they are measures commonly used by investors and they are measures that we use in managing
our business. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as presented in this offering memorandum, however, may not be comparable to
similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in the way these measures are calculated. The reconciliation
of these measure to net profit(loss) for the period is as follows:

**THE COMPANY’S MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS**
**OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**

_The following review relates to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations as of and for the_
_periods discussed below. “The Company’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and_
_Results of Operations” is based on the historical financial data included in this offering memorandum and should_
_be read in conjunction with “Presentation of Financial Data,” “Summary of Company and Group Run-Rate,_
_Vivacom, Unaudited Pro Forma and Certain Other Financial Data,” “Selected Company Historical Financial_
_Data,” the Company Audited Financial Statements and the Company Unaudited Interim Financial Statements_
_included in this offering memorandum. Prospective investors should read the entire offering memorandum and not_
_just rely on the information set out below. The following discussion of our results of operations and financial_
_condition contains forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those that we_
_discuss in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include_
_those discussed below and elsewhere in this offering memorandum, particularly under “Risk Factors” and_
_“Forward-looking Statements.”_

**Our Business Overview**

We are the leading cable and media player in Southeastern Europe, providing services to approximately
3.7 million homes as of March 31, 2021. We are the leading distributor of Pay-TV in our core markets of
Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and the number two distributor in Montenegro. As of March 31,
2021, we provided services to approximately 10.9 million RGUs and analog and digital cable Pay-TV services
to approximately 1.9 million unique subscribers. United Group’s revenue for the three months ended
March 31, 2021 was €439.4 million and UG Adjusted EBITDA was €179.2 million. The Group had Run-Rate
Revenue for the annualized last two quarters ended March 31, 2021 of €1,916.4 million and Run-Rate Last
Two Quarter Annualized Adjusted EBITDA for March 31, 2021 was €706.3 million.

The Combined Group is the clear multi-play leader in its footprint, with market leading positions in Pay-TV,
broadband internet and fixed-line and mobile-telephony in Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Montenegro, North Macedonia, Bulgaria, Croatia and, following the Forthnet Acquisition, Greece. The
Combined Group’s addressable market comprised 13.4 million households as of December 31, 2020.

We have grown rapidly through both acquisitions and organic growth. In July 2020, we acquired Vivacom, the
market leading integrated telecommunications operator in Bulgaria, based on total revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2020, which is the leading operator in fixed-line telephony services and broadband services, the
number three provider of mobile-telephony services and the number three provider of Pay-TV, in each case,
by number of subscribers as of March 31, 2021. The Vivacom Acquisition increased our addressable market
by approximately 35% in terms of population, and the addition of Vivacom’s subscriber base more than
doubled our existing subscriber base. In March 2020, we also acquired Tele2 Croatia, the third largest
telecommunications operator in Croatia, based on mobile revenues as of March 31, 2021, through which we
offer mobile services in Croatia. In November 2020, we completed the acquisition of a controlling interest in
Forthnet S.A., a prominent telecom operator and Pay-TV provider in Greece, which marked our entry into
the Greek market and will strengthen our position as an industry leader in Southeastern Europe. In
January 2021, we acquired Bulgaria’s largest multi-platform media company, Nova Broadcasting Group
EOOD, from Advance Media Group EAD, providing a strong base for our content offering in Bulgaria. In
July 2021, we signed an agreement to acquire a majority interest in Optima Telekom, a Croatian telecom
operator offering a broad range of fixed internet and pay-TV services. Subject to its completion, the Optima
Telekom Acquisition will allow us to further expand our presence in the Croatian market and offer a full range
of telecommunication services, including pay-TV, through our existing infrastructure in the country.

We offer a diverse and differentiated line of products and services. We are the leading distributor of satellite
(“DTH”) Pay-TV across Southeastern Europe, with Pay-TV product and service offerings in each of Slovenia,
Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia and Montenegro, where we use our Total TV platform to
serve subscribers both inside and outside of our cable footprint to deliver content across the entire region,
including rural areas. Following the Vivacom Acquisition, we also provide Pay-TV services in Bulgaria and
are the leading IPTV provider in Bulgaria, while the Nova Broadcasting Group Acquisition strengthened our
content offering in Bulgaria. Following the Forthnet Acquisition, we also provide cable and DTH services in
Greece. In addition to our cable-based and satellite-based services, we offer mobile-telephony services in
Slovenia, Bulgaria and Croatia. We provide 4G LTE coverage to almost the entire population in each of these
countries, and we are rolling out 5G networks across our mobile-telephony footprint. On September 21, 2020,
we announced the commercial launch of our 5G network in Bulgaria, and to that end in May 2021, we
secured a 20-year license for 100 MHz spectrum frequencies in the 3.6 GHz band. We also in April 2021


-----

secured 15-year spectrum licenses in Slovenia for 5G frequencies, and commenced deployment and
commercial launch of 5G 3600 MHz in Slovenia in June 2021. We are participating in a 5G spectrum auction
in Croatia this year.

Our core telecommunications business is also complemented by our two OTT distribution platforms that
customers can access through internet based streaming: EON, our regional OTT platform, which enables
customers connected to our competitors’ broadband internet connections outside of our cable footprint to
access our attractive portfolio of Pay-TV channels, and NetTV Plus, our international OTT platform, which
delivers ethnic and local language content to the ex-Yugoslav diaspora around the world. In July 2020, we
launched Shoppster, our regional e-commerce online-shopping platform, which offers more than 20 popular
product categories, including electronics, home and gardening, tools, fashion, items for children and kitchen
appliances. Shoppster is available as an integrated online and TV shopping platform in Serbia and Slovenia.

Through our in-house content business, we produce distinctive and attractive in-house media content for our
Pay-TV channels across multiple key genres that have historically driven Pay-TV subscriptions. These channels
include Southeastern Europe’s most popular family of branded Pay-TV sports channels, as well as popular
movie channels, children’s channels, a 24/7 news channel, music channels and other specialized channels,
which we continue to expand both organically and through acquisitions. We currently produce over 40% of
the total content in our national (terrestrial) and cable operations, and our programs typically receive ratings
of between 30% to 60% in the markets in which they are available. The Group also has in-house media and
content production in Greece. We believe that our market leading content portfolio differentiates us from our
competitors, has enabled strong growth in our business and provides us with predictable third-party carriage
fees.

As part of our media business, we also provide advertising services and digital production and distribution.
Our Nova TV Croatia channel has strong local content production and profitability, with an audience share
of 40% and market share by advertising revenue of 50%. Nova BH and Nova M have appealing content, such
as popular national team football events until 2022, such as the Euro Cup qualifiers, Euro Cup, World Cup
qualifiers and League of Nations. In March 2019, we launched Nova S in Serbia. Nova S is a channel offering
high-quality local production series, sports, talk shows with well-known national presenters and high-quality
international productions, fully exclusive to SBB, Total TV and EON. The Nova Broadcasting Group
Acquisition makes us a major content player in Bulgaria by adding Nova BG’s media platform comprising
ten television channels, including NOVA TV, which broadcasts throughout Bulgaria, Bulgaria’s largest online
platform, Net Info, which reaches on average 80% of the Bulgarian population each month, and four radio
stations.

In addition to our own content, as a result of our pan regional presence and well established distribution
network, we are a distribution partner of choice for premium regional and international content owners, such
as Discovery/Eurosport, Viacom, AXN, CNN, HBO, Fox and Universal, and sports rights owners, such as
the English Premier League, Spanish Football League LaLiga, 2020 UEFA European Championship
qualifiers, 2020 UEFA European Championship, 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, UEFA League of Nations,
ATP, Formula 1, Euroleague, and Moto GP, which we believe allows us to consistently obtain high-quality
content and attractive payment terms. Nova BG holds licenses to offer compelling content in Bulgaria through
distributors such as CBS Intenrational, the Walt Disney Company, Columbia Pictures and Paramount
Pictures, as well as popular sports content such as the English Premier League football, Euro Cup qualifiers
and the Euro Cup and Formula One racing. We believe these providers partner with us because of our
well-known brands, large network and our focus on Southeastern Europe.

We operate most of our business across eight countries in Southeastern Europe: Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and
Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Greece. These countries have a
combined population of approximately 40 million, distributed across approximately 13.4 million households
as of December 31, 2020, and represent the second-largest CEE market after Poland. Despite economic
differences, many of these countries share a joint history and form a single market in which small local
differences are overshadowed by the influence of similarities in cultural preferences and language across the
region and are characterized by growing Pay-TV and broadband markets that are currently underpenetrated
relative to some other CEE and Western European markets.

We are the leading multi-play provider in Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Bulgaria, where we
combine our services into packages, or bundles, which offer subscribers the convenience of being able to
purchase television, broadband internet and telephony services from a single provider, and provides us with
significant opportunities to cross-sell our products.


-----

We believe that we are well-positioned to maintain our market leading positions in the Pay-TV and cable
broadband internet markets in Slovenia, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to further increase our
market shares, as we differentiate our product offerings through one of the highest download speeds in our
broadband markets, access to desirable media content, a well invested network and high-quality customer
service, which has led to relatively low churn rates which we believe demonstrate customer loyalty. We also
believe that we are well-positioned to continue to grow in our region, and build on our expansion into Bulgaria
and Greece. Our customers view the telecommunications products and services that we offer as part of their
everyday lives, which results in recurring, high demand for our products and makes our business more resilient
to macro-economic disruptions when compared to other discretionary products and services. For example,
during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic our products and services have been instrumental in providing
connectivity and entertainment, as an increasing number of people began to work or study remotely and
spent significant amounts of time at home, which resulted in a significant increase in our voice and data
traffic between March and May 2020. In particular, over this period, our fixed data traffic increased at rates
between 50% and 70%, while fixed voice traffic increased at rates between 50% and 85%, depending on the
country. In addition, our mobile data and voice traffic increased at rates between 30% and 40%, depending on
the country. Traffic levels decreased during the summer months and started increasing again as new lockdowns
were implemented in various countries. To accommodate such higher customer demand, we increased capacity
on network elements and interconnections. In this recurring, high demand environment, we believe we offer
superior products, faster broadband speeds and higher quality content than many of our competitors.

**Key Factors Affecting Our Business and Results of Operations**

The performance of our businesses, our results of operations and the key operating measures discussed below
have been, and will continue to be, affected by a variety of factors. Certain of these factors are discussed
below.

**_Products, Services and Content_**

Our results are impacted by our product mix as well as our ability to introduce new products and upgrades
and successfully sell those products and upgrades to increase our RGUs and ARPUs. We continually evaluate
the suite of products and services we provide to our subscribers to ensure that we remain competitive with
other providers in our markets and have an opportunity to increase our subscriber base and the number of
products we sell to our subscribers. We accomplish this through product innovation, investments in technology
and acquisitions of complementary businesses. For example, we have expanded our product offering by
introducing fixed-line services to offer multi-play packages in Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and
Montenegro, including pay television, broadband internet access, fixed-line telephony, as well as mobiletelephony services in Slovenia and following the completion of the acquisition of Tele2 Croatia in March 2020,
in Croatia. Following completion of the Vivacom Acquisition in July 2020, we also offer pay television,
broadband internet access, fixed-line telephony, and mobile-telephony services in Bulgaria. Following the
Forthnet Acquisition in November 2020, we also offer telecommunications and Pay-TV services in Greece.

We believe that media and communications services customers will increasingly choose bundled products
because of the convenience and enhanced value resulting from obtaining TV, broadband internet and
telephony services from a single provider for one price. As of March 31, 2021, 85% of our customer base in
Slovenia, 79% of our customer base in Serbia, 87% of our customer base in Bosnia and Herzegovina and 54%
of our customer base in Bulgaria subscribed for one of our multi-play packages (our customer base is
calculated based on unique cable subscribers by bundle).

We seek to be the leader in our markets in pay television content and have entered into long-term strategic
partnerships with key international and regional content owners. We have also acquired leading regional
content owners in key television sub-segments (sports, lifestyle, children and films), such as providers of the
Sport Klub family of channels (which includes Sport Klub, Golf Klub and our fishing and hunting channels),
N1, Fight Channel, Pikaboo and Cinemania. Our ability to maintain the quality of our content impacts our
ability to sell our pay television offerings, as well as bundled packages.

Our product mix can also impact our margins. For example, our mobile-telephony business and our content
business generally have lower margins compared to our cable-based business. Our success in growing these
businesses may impact our product mix and therefore may affect UG Adjusted EBITDA margins.

**_Pricing of Our Products and Services_**

Increasing demand for attractive content and higher broadband speeds allows us to increase the prices at
which we provide these services while maintaining relatively low churn rates. We regularly review the prices of


-----

our products and services, however, and in the past have adjusted our subscription fees as necessary in line
with inflation, changes in foreign exchange rates or in response to market conditions and content costs.
Changes in the pricing of our products and services will impact the revenues and margins that we generate
from these products and services and impact our ability to attract new customers. For example, our multi-play
bundles offer subscribers higher value in terms of channels, speeds functionality and add on features. The
pricing of all our services, including our multi-play bundles, is dependent on market conditions, pricing by
competitors with similar offerings and the perceived quality of our products versus other products. In relation
to our Basic TV package, we were also subject to price regulation in Serbia until January 2017. From
January 2017, the price of our Basic TV package in Serbia is no longer subject to price regulation. However,
such price regulation might be reinstated in the future, and we regularly monitor the media market in Serbia
to stay aware of market conditions which may lead to price regulation.

**_Subscriber Churn_**

The television, broadband internet and telephony industries exhibit churn as a result of high levels of
competition. In addition to competitive alternatives, churn levels may be affected by changes in our prices or
our competitors’ prices, our level of subscriber satisfaction, subscriber mortality and the relocation of
subscribers, as well as from the termination of agreements. An increase in churn may lead to increased costs
and reduced revenues when subscribers cancel our services as we incur additional marketing and advertising
costs to find new subscribers.

Increasing demand for attractive content and higher broadband speeds allows us to increase the prices at
which we provide these services while maintaining relatively low churn rates. We believe our relatively low
churn rates provide us with recurring cash flows and visibility with respect to future revenues. We have
historically experienced low churn rates in our television, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony
businesses, and the churn we have experienced in these businesses has primarily been driven by customers
moving outside of our current geographic area of services as well as termination of services due to their
inability to pay, with only a limited amount of churn driven by competition. We believe that launching
telephony in our markets, further driving digitization, providing our subscribers with multi-play packages
(including quad-play in Slovenia, as described in more detail below), expanding our cable footprint to broaden
our geographic reach and benefiting from increasing disposable incomes in the region (reducing the likelihood
of customers’ bad debt), will allow us to maintain low churn rates for cable Pay-TV. In addition, we believe
that as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our churn rates will likely decrease as customers are unlikely or
unable to easily migrate to another provider during the pandemic.

The churn rates for our mobile post-paid subscribers are higher than the churn rates for our fixed-line
telephony services, as it is easier for mobile subscribers to switch to our competitors as there are no
infrastructure limitations. Similarly, the churn rate of mobile prepaid subscribers is relatively higher because
of the non-contractual nature of the relationship with such subscribers. We believe, however, that we have
developed an attractive suite of fixed mobile convergence services in Slovenia which, among other things, has
had the effect of reducing the churn of our mobile post-paid subscribers in Slovenia. Following the
consummation of the acquisition of Tele2 Croatia in March 2020, we are leveraging on our experience and
the lessons learned from integrating Tušmobil to guide our integration of Tele2 Croatia. Since our acquisition
of Tušmobil, our number of quad-play subscribers in Slovenia has increased to 38% of our subscribers in
Slovenia as of March 31, 2021, from 1% of our subscribers in Slovenia prior to the acquisition. The blended
annual churn rate of Telemach Slovenia’s mobile post-paid subscribers as of March 31, 2021, was 11.5%,
compared to 11.2% as of January 31, 2017. We define blended annual churn as net lost subscribers (the
number of customers that either on a voluntary or involuntary basis no longer subscribe for a certain service)
divided by the number of all unique cable subscribers at the beginning of period, which result is then
annualized. We have been using the principles learned through our acquisition of Tušmobil and our experience
providing mobile services in Slovenia to inform the operation of our mobile-telephony business in Bulgaria
following the completion of the Vivacom Acquisition in July 2020 and in Croatia following the Tele2 Croatia
Acquisition completed in March 2021.

**_Cost of Services Provided_**

Our most significant costs include (i) carriage fees which we pay to international and regional broadcasters
such as Fox, Discovery and Pink, in order to carry their programs on our distribution network, (ii) licensing
fees payable to sports rights owners such as UEFA, the English Premier League, Spanish Primera League,
ATP and Formula 1, in order to develop content for our own channels, (iii) satellite capacity costs, (iv) payroll
costs, (v) internet and interconnection fees, (vi) costs of materials used to connect subscribers to our network


-----

and (vii) costs for marketing and sales. Most of our costs, such as a portion of our network operations,
customer care, billing and administration costs, are relatively fixed, while a portion of our marketing and
customer services cost is variable. Our content acquisition costs are mostly fixed and a decreasing portion of
these costs are subscriber based. Where possible, we aim to negotiate fixed rate content costs. This approach
allows us to anticipate the input price of our content and price our products accordingly. The costs associated
with the growth of our business, such as RGU acquisition costs, which are primarily comprised of campaign
costs and sales costs for attracting new subscribers, are variable costs.

A large portion of our costs is content costs, accounting for 18% of our operating expenses (not including
depreciation and amortization of intangible assets) for the three months ended March 31, 2021. While we
own a portion of our content, we are dependent on broadcasters and other content owners for most of our
programming. We pay license fees to several regional and international broadcasters in order to broadcast
their programs. For on demand content purchased by our subscribers, we generally pay a revenue share of the
retail price, subject, for certain on demand content, to fixed minimum guarantees. For packaged on demand
content (subscription video on demand), we pay on a per subscriber basis, sometimes with minimum
guarantees. We generally expect that our content costs (above the minimum amounts) will increase in line with
increased revenues from digital Pay-TV and on demand content. In the past we have successfully obtained
rebates and discounts for our content, but these may not continue in the future.

We pay fees to satellite operators to uplink and transmit our content to our DTH subscribers, and we also use
other network operators to connect telephone calls of our customers to customers of their respective networks
(interconnection). Generally, the amount we pay in interconnection fees in any period will depend on the level
of usage of our services.

Our staff cost is impacted by the number of personnel we employ, the experience levels at which such persons
are employed and increases in salaries and bonuses due to performance factors. Labor costs of technicians,
spent on the construction and upgrade of our network and acquisition of subscribers, are capitalized as
tangible and intangible assets.

RGU acquisition costs include campaign costs and sales costs. We aim to recover RGU acquisition costs over
the duration of the service contract. Factors that contribute to successful recovery of RGU acquisition costs
include our operational efficiency, the density of our subscriber base and our direct relationships with our
subscribers, which enables us not to rely on intermediaries to interact with our customers.

**_Network and Technological Advances_**

Our ability to provide new high definition and on demand digital TV services, broadband internet access at
higher speeds and telephony services to subscribers depends, in part, on our ability to upgrade and maintain
our network. We incur capital expenditure charges in periods over which these upgrades are made, with the
aim of recouping these investments through increased revenues and profitability.

In particular, we expect certain communications technologies that are currently under development, 5G
technology in particular, to become increasingly important in our markets. We successfully tested and are
rolling out our next generation 5G networks across our mobile-telephony footprint. In Slovenia,
5G 3600 MHz deployment and commercial launch began in June 2021, following a successful frequency
auction result in April 2021. In Bulgaria, 5G has been launched commercially using 4G 1900 MHz spectrum
in September 2020, which was the first available 5G service in the market, and in May 2021, Vivacom has
secured a 20-year license for 100 MHz spectrum frequencies in the 3.6 GHz band. In Croatia, the first
deployment of the 5G C-Band is expected during the third or fourth quarters of 2021, and Telemach Croatia
is participating in the 5G spectrum auction in Croatia. We believe that significant investments in 5G
technology will be critical to remain competitive in the mobile market and meet our customers’ needs.

Our ability to compete effectively and maintain or increase our customer base depends on our ability to
anticipate and react quickly to technological developments and evolving industry standards and develop
successful new and enhanced products and services to adapt to changes in our market. We invest in new or
enhanced technologies, products or services in periods over which industry standards change, or to upgrade
our technologies proactively. Additionally, we incur capital expenditure costs relating to the replacement of
existing equipment. We expect to incur substantial capital expenditure costs in the future relating to new 4G
and 5G frequencies and the installation of new equipment.

**_Foreign Currency Exchange Rates_**

We operate across Southeastern Europe, generating revenues in many local currencies, which fluctuate from
time to time in relation to the euro. Our revenues in Slovenia, Montenegro and Greece are generated in euro.


-----

SBB Serbia and Telemach BH record their financial results in the Serbian dinar and the Bosnian and
Herzegovinian mark, respectively, which are then translated into euros in preparing our consolidated financial
statements. In the three months ended March 31, 2021, 72% of our revenue was generated in euros or
currencies pegged to the euro, with 15% of our revenue generated in Serbian dinars and 13% of revenue
generated in Croatian kuna. While the Bosnian and Herzegovinian mark is pegged against the euro at a fixed
exchange rate of BAM 1.9558 per €1.00 and the Bulgarian lev is pegged against the euro at a fixed exchange
rate of BGN 1.9558 per €1.00, the Serbian dinar freely fluctuates against the euro. For the three months ended
March 31, 2021, the value of the Serbian dinar remained stable relative to the euro. However, due to the
historic indexation of the Serbian dinar against the German mark, which was replaced by the euro in 2002, we
believe the Serbian consumer price index closely tracks the depreciation of the Serbian dinar against the euro
which has historically allowed us to “pass through”a portion of the impact of the depreciation of the dinar to
our customers. We believe that our pricing strategy reflects this “pass through” principle. In the three months
ended March 31, 2021, the value of the Croatian kuna increased approximately 1% relative to the euro
compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020.

We present our consolidated financial statements in euro. As a result, we must translate the assets, liabilities,
revenue and expenses of all of our operations with a functional currency other than the euro into euros at then
applicable exchange rates. Consequently, increases or decreases in the value of these currencies against the
euro may affect the value of our assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses with respect to our non-euro businesses
in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. These
translations could significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods and result in
significant changes to the carrying value of our assets, liabilities and stockholders’ equity.

Additionally, certain of our expenses, primarily content and satellite costs, are denominated in euros and U.S.
dollars. Where we are unable to match sales received in foreign currencies with costs paid in the same currency,
our results of operations are impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations. A substantial portion of our
indebtedness is denominated in euros. Based on our lack of any material change in exposure to the U.S. dollar
in the three months ended March 31, 2021, we did not enter into any additional currency hedge agreements
during the three months ended March 31, 2021.

**_Growth in Our Markets_**

Three of our key markets—Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro—are generally characterized
by lower internet broadband household penetration rates compared to elsewhere in Western Europe and the
CEE region and both Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina have lower pay television household penetration
rates compared to elsewhere in Western Europe and the CEE region. As a result, growth in our markets has
been higher than in certain CEE and Western Europe jurisdictions. We believe this is primarily due to the
increasing importance of high-quality broadband internet and an increasing convergence of our regions with
the EU. Slovenia is a more mature market, with subscriber rates similar to the CEE region, and as a result,
growth in that market will depend more on our ability to effectively compete with other market participants
and to continue to offer high-quality customer propositions. Following the completion of the Tele2 Croatia
Acquisition in March 2020, we also have operations in Croatia. As a member of the EU with relatively high
GDP per capita and growth rates, Croatia is an attractive market for our continued expansion. The Croatian
mobile market is characterized by high market stability, as it has a low level of fragmentation and disruption,
with only three MNOs in the market (including Telemach Croatia), and the country’s telecommunications
infrastructure is highly dependent on mobile access, with one of the highest mobile ARPU among CEE
countries. We believe that our growth in this market will depend on several factors, such as the ability to
expand our territorial coverage as well as improve the quality of our network and customer support services,
including through investments to increase our capacity and quality levels and through the continued
development of our digital and sales channels. In addition, following the completion of the Vivacom
Acquisition in July 2020, we also have operations in Bulgaria. Bulgaria experienced relatively strong GDP
growth at an average rate of 3.3% per year between 2017 and 2019 (according to the BNSI), but faces economic
and political challenges in sustaining this growth.

Following the Forthnet Acquisition, we also have operations in Greece. The Greek telecommunications market
is characterized by intense competition. The market is concentrated among four main operators with a focus
on fixed-mobile convergent offerings. The total fixed-line market, comprised of approximately 4.8 million
subscribers, has stable with limited fixed-to-mobile substitution, while the broadband market, comprised of
approximately 4.2 million subscribers continues to grow at the expense of voice-only lines. NGA subscribers
(those with broadband speeds of greater than 30 Mbps) comprise approximately one-third of total broadband
subscribers, but this level remains low compared with the EU average of over 60%. Pay-TV penetration is also


-----

low compared to EU averages, with 26% of Greek households subscribing to Pay-TV. In Greece, the majority
of Pay-TV subscribers are served through DTH technology, while the remainder is served through IPTV.

In each of the aforementioned markets, a number of factors will impact the rate of growth of pay television,
broadband internet and telephony industries, including economic conditions, political stability, increases in
infrastructure and an increased distribution of wealth. Furthermore, these industries may not grow at the
same rate as they have in the past.

**_Regulation_**

Our operations are subject to various regulations in Europe and in our regional markets. We are generally free
from retail price regulation other than, prior to January 2017, with respect to our Basic TV package in Serbia,
due to SBB Serbia’s prior SMP in the Serbian Pay-TV market. Since January 2017, we are no longer considered
a significant market participant in the Pay-TV market in Serbia, thus our Basic TV package is no longer
subject to price regulation, although this may change in the future, and we regularly monitor the market to
stay aware of market conditions which may lead to price regulation. In Croatia, we are currently subject to
price regulation only with respect to fixed and mobile termination rates charged by operators to each other
for interconnection services, which are regulated in the whole European Union. In addition, in Serbia we are
subject to price regulation only to the extent we are required to provide access to our wholesale network.

SBB Serbia is, however, currently deemed to have SMP on the wholesale market for call termination in public
telephone networks and the wholesale market of central access at a fixed location for mass market products,
which imposes certain regulatory obligations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and
_Industry—We may become subject to more extensive regulation due to our scale.” We also implemented price_
increases in January 2018, which the Serbian Commission for Protection of Competition investigated, but
ultimately accepted. In addition, we may be subject to conditions imposed in connection with competition
authority clearances as we continue to expand our business through bolt on, value accretive acquisitions and
we may be subject to market power analysis from the relevant regulators, which could force us to adjust our
prices or sell various parts of our businesses. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and
_Industry—We may become subject to more extensive regulation due to our scale” and “Our Business—_
_Regulatory Framework.”_

**_Tax Treatment in Local Jurisdictions_**

The results of our operations depend on our tax treatment under the tax laws and regulations of local
jurisdictions. For instance, in Serbia, taxable income can be reduced in the same proportion as capital
expenditure for the year in Serbia divided by the carrying amount of assets in Serbia. Due to our significant
capital expenditure in Serbia in 2016, we believe we have satisfied the requirements to be granted a ten year tax
beneficial status, expiring in 2025, and we recorded beneficial tax treatment for our SBB Serbia segment for
the years ending December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and the three months ended March 31, 2021. Additionally,
under thin capitalization rules in Serbia, interest and related costs under intercompany loans are recognized
as deductible expenses to the extent the intercompany loans do not exceed four times the borrower’s equity. In
2017 and 2018, SBB Serbia did not capitalize any intercompany loans. On December 27, 2018, the Serbian
Tax Authority notified United Group that it had begun a tax investigation of SBB Serbia for the year ended
December 31, 2012. The Serbian Tax Authority issued a decision in March 2019 that it had recharacterized
interest payments made by SBB Serbia under an intragroup loan agreement (and certain debt and equity
conversions) as dividends, which would have been subject to a 5% withholding tax, and found a total
contingent liability in respect of this decision amounting to €21 million, including late interest. On October 12,
2020, the Serbian Ministry of Finance annulled the Serbian Tax Authority’s decision and instructed the
Serbian Tax Authority to restart the procedure, taking into account the arguments provided in SSB Serbia’s
appeal. The Serbian Tax Authority has also informed SBB Serbia that it is opening a tax review for the years
2013 through 2016. SBB Serbia intends to continue contesting the Serbian Tax Authority’s findings. For more
information, see “Our Business—Legal Proceedings—Investigation by the Serbian Tax Authority.”

Furthermore, in Slovenia, Telemach Slovenia may use a tax allowance for investment in equipment and
intangible assets (available for investments made after January 1, 2008), whereby the tax allowance is limited
to 40% of the value of the assets, up to the amount of the tax base. In 2018, 2019 and 2020, Telemach Slovenia
used the tax allowance for investments in the amount of €11.5 million, €10.5 million and €9.3 million,
respectively.

In Bosnia and Herzegovina, a taxpayer who invests more than BAM 20.0 million (€10.2 million) in production
assets (property, plant and equipment) within the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina for five


-----

consecutive years is relieved from 50% of taxation on such investments for a period of five years, starting from
the first year in which it has invested at least BAM 4 million (€2.0 million). Pursuant to this provision, in 2018,
2019 and 2020, Telemach BH received a tax allowance for investments in the amount of BAM 6.1 million
(€3.1 million), BAM 6.8 million (€3.5 million) and BAM 2.7 million (€1.4 million), respectively. In Bosnia and
Herzegovina, a taxpayer receives a tax allowance when it employs certain types of employees, and in 2018,
2019 and 2020, Telemach BH received a tax allowance for certain new employees in the amount of
BAM 1.3 million (€0.7 million), BAM 2.0 million (€1.0 million) and BAM 2.9 million (€1.5 million),
respectively.

In Greece, the corporate income tax rate was set at 24% in 2019. From January 1, 2020, withholding taxes on
dividends were reduced from 10% to 5%, and on July 1, 2020, Greece implemented a participation exemption
for capital gains from the sale of Greek and EU subsidiaries. For internet services, customers are charged a 5%
tax on top of internet subscriptions (in addition to VAT of 24%). In addition, a 10% tax on top of Pay-TV
subscriptions for Greek operators (in addition to VAT of 24%) has been imposed, although this has been
suspended until September 2021.

**_Implementation of Accounting Policies and Accounting Updates_**

_IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers_

IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is
recognized. While IFRS 15 became effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1,
2018, with early adoption permitted, we commenced the recognition of revenue broadly in line with IFRS 15
for periods starting January 1, 2016 as debundling of services was applied beginning on January 1, 2016.
Other standards in compliance with IFRS 15 were applied from January 1, 2018. There were two primary
changes that we implemented in accordance with IFRS 15.

First, with respect to handset sales that are subsidized by ongoing service fees, we used to recognize revenue
only in the amount of cash received for such mobile phones. However, under the new standard, we allocate a
contract’s transaction price based on the relative stand-alone selling price of the mobile phone. More revenue
is recognized upfront as a result. As a result of implementing this policy in 2016, we have not seen a material
impact on our reported financial results for periods that commenced after January 1, 2018 when IFRS 15 was
fully implemented.

Concurrently, we corrected an accounting policy regarding discounts to contracts. Contracts where a customer
pays for equipment, such as handsets, in installments over a period of more than one year (in addition to
ongoing services) may be deemed to have a significant financing component, particularly in the case of
discounts during the first few months of a contract. The majority of new or renewed contracts provide for
discounts during the first few months of a contract. Under IFRS, such a discount during the first few months
is ignored, and the total price of the contract is spread out over the entire contract period. Furthermore,
revenue is adjusted to reflect the time value of money.

Second, we charge non-refundable service activation fees to all new customers at the beginning of their
contract. These fees do not transfer goods or services to the customer, but are more administrative in nature
and do not render a service or provide a benefit to the customer. Under IFRS 15, such fees should be spread
over the entire contract period as they are related to the performance obligation of providing a mobile service,
which results in a contractual liability at the beginning of the contract on the balance sheet.

_IFRS 9 Financial Instruments_

IFRS 9 replaces the existing guidance in IAS 39 (Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement) that
relates to the recognition, classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities,
derecognition of financial instruments, impairment of financial assets and hedge accounting. IFRS 9 also
includes revised guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments, including a new
expected credit loss model for calculating impairment on financial assets and the new general hedge accounting
requirements. Most IAS 39 requirements concerning classification and measurement of financial liabilities
and de recognition of financial instruments were transferred to IFRS 9 unchanged.

The standard introduces the following categories of financial assets: measured at amortized cost, measured at
fair value through profit and loss and measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.
Classification is performed on initial recognition and depends on the business model for managing of financial
assets adopted by the Group and on the characteristics of the contractual cash flows from such instruments.


-----

The adoption of IFRS 9 from January 1, 2018 resulted in changes in accounting policies and adjustments to
the amounts recognized in our accumulated loss.

_IFRS 16 Leases_

IFRS 16 introduced for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 a single, on balance
sheet lease accounting model for lessees. A lessee recognizes a right-of-use asset representing its right to use
the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. There are
recognition exemptions for short-term leases and leases of low value items available on a voluntary basis.
Lessor accounting remains similar to the previous standard—i.e., lessors continue to classify leases as finance
or operating leases.

Under IFRS 16, we recognize new assets and liabilities for our operating leases of satellite capacity, office
facilities, parts of our infrastructure and base stations and the right-of-use of water and land. The nature of
expenses related to those leases changed because we recognized a depreciation charge for right-of-use assets
and interest expense on lease liabilities. Previously, we recognized operating lease expense on a straight-line
basis over the term of the lease, and recognized assets and liabilities only to the extent that there was a timing
difference between actual lease payments and the expense recognized. There has been no significant impact
for our finance leases in which we are the lessor.

We applied the simplified transition approach and did not restate comparative amounts for the year prior to
first adoption. Right-of-use assets for property leases were measured on transition as if the new rules had
always been applied. All other right-of-use assets have been measured at the amount of the lease liability on
adoption (adjusted for any prepaid or accrued lease expenses).

_IFRIC 23_

In June 2017, the IFRS Interpretation Committee issued IFRIC 23, which clarifies the accounting treatment
of uncertainties in income taxes, specifically in relation to taxable profit or loss, tax bases, unused tax losses,
unused tax credits and tax rates, when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments under IAS 12.

IFRIC 23 states that an entity should assume that the applicable taxation authority will have full knowledge
of all relevant information when examining amounts reported to it. An entity therefore has to consider
whether it is probable that the applicable authority will accept a certain tax treatment in the entity’s income
tax filing and either adopt an approach consistent with the tax treatment in its income tax filings or use the
expected value of the tax treatment when determining taxable profit or loss, tax bases, unused tax losses,
unused tax credits and tax rates.

IFRIC 23 is applicable for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 with early adoption
permitted. In adopting IFRIC 23, we applied a modified retrospective approach whereby the cumulative
effect of initially applying IFRIC 23, if any, should be recognized in opening equity at the date of initial
application. As part of our adoption of IFRIC 23, we have not identified any additional material income tax
uncertainties for which we would be required to recognize a related tax liability.

In the three months ended March 31, 2021, we have also applied certain other amendments to existing
accounting standards that did not have any impact on the amounts recognized in prior periods and that are
not expected to significantly affect current or future periods.

**Key Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Results of Operations**

**_Acquisition History_**

Since January 1, 2017, we have expanded our business by acquiring and integrating the following cable TV
operators, mobile-telephony service providers, B2B service providers and ISPs:

In 2017, we acquired:

- Fight Channel, a specialized martial arts channel in Croatia offering a range of mixed martial arts sports,
kickboxing and boxing, which has provided us with an extension of our program content and contributed
to an increase in our number of subscribers, for a total consideration of €2.5 million. The transaction
closed on April 5, 2017;

- Ikom, a cable operator in Serbia with 93 thousand unique cable subscribers, which has provided us with an
increased share of the cable market in Serbia through access to Ikom’s customer database, for a total
consideration of €45 million. The transaction closed on April 20, 2017 (subject to conditions from the


-----

CPC, as described in “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—We have made and may
_make acquisitions or enter into transactions that may present unforeseen risks, and we may not realize the_
_financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction and, additionally, there are_
_risks associated with the integration of any acquisitions”);_

- 51% of IDJ Digital Holding Limited, a digital distributor of music and online video content based in
Malta, which has provided us with expansion of our business activities into digital distribution, for a total
consideration of €0.6 million. The transaction closed on April 20, 2017;

- ASK, a cable operator is Bosnia and Herzegovina with approximately 2,000 subscribers, and which has
increased our share of the cable market in such market, for a total consideration of €0.6 million. The
transaction closed on October 9, 2017;

- D.o.o. Kabel Group 85 Čačak, a cable operator in Serbia with approximately 3,805 subscribers and which
has since been merged with SBB Serbia, and which has increased our share of the cable market in such
market, for a total consideration of €2.1 million. The transaction closed on October 18, 2017; and

- Teleing, d.o.o., a cable operator in Slovenia with approximately 14,000 subscribers, and which has increased
our share of the cable market in such market, for a total consideration of €10 million. The transaction
closed in December 2017.

In 2018, we acquired:

- Nova TV d.d., a provider of full format, general entertainment flagship stations geared towards mainstream
audiences as well as a range of thematic channels, from CME B.V. in the Nova TV Croatia Acquisition,
which acquisition completed on July 31, 2018, for a total consideration of €86.4 million (including net
working capital adjustments); and

- 100% of the outstanding shares (excluding treasury shares) in Direct Media, a leading media buying agency
in Serbia, which acquisition completed on September 4, 2018. The transaction included Direct Media’s
operations in Serbia, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Albania, as well as the company’s terrestrial TV
stations Pink BiH and Pink Montenegro (which we have rebranded Nova BH and Nova M, respectively).
Direct Media is a full service media agency, offering integrated communication, advertising and media
services to local and international partners.

In 2018, we sold our Total TV operations in Croatia in connection with the Nova TV Croatia Acquisition.
The total consideration was €3 million, and the transaction closed on January 12, 2018. In connection with
the sale, we entered into a one year transitional support agreement.

In 2019, we acquired:

- Netlogic d.o.o. Beograd, a Serbian IT services company, for a total consideration of €2.0 million. The
transaction closed on April 1, 2019;

- Skyline Kabel d.o.o., a Slovenian telecommunications company, for a total consideration of €1.1 million.
The transaction closed on November 1, 2019; and

- FMC Datacenter d.o.o., a Slovenian web hosting company, for a total consideration of €0.6 million. The
transaction closed on December 31, 2019.

In 2020, we acquired:

- Tele2 Croatia, the third largest MNO in Croatia, for cash consideration of €126.0 million. We financed the
acquisition through the issuance of €207.0 million in aggregate principal amount of additional Existing
2024 SSNs. The acquisition closed on March 3, 2020.

- Vivacom, the largest telecommunications operator in Bulgaria by revenue, for cash consideration of
€937.8 million. We financed the acquisition of Vivacom through the issuance of the Existing 2026 SSNs,
the Existing 2026 FRNs and additional Existing PIK Notes. Following approval by the European
Commission in April 2020, the acquisition was consummated on July 31, 2020. Expansion in Bulgaria
increased our addressable market by approximately 35% in terms of population, and the addition of
Vivacom’s subscriber base more than doubled our existing subscriber base and included three million
mobile subscribers, 541 thousand fixed-telephony subscribers, 472 thousand fixed broadband subscribers
and 508 thousand fixed Pay-TV subscribers. Following the completion of the Vivacom Acquisition, we
increased our commitments in respect of our Existing Revolving Credit Facility to €250 million.

In September 2020, we completed the acquisition of a significant minority interest in Forthnet, a prominent
telecom operator and Pay-TV provider in Greece for a cash consideration of €44 million. Forthnet provides


-----

home entertainment and communications services to nearly 1.4 million RGUs. In November 2020, we
acquired a controlling interest in Forthnet. Our acquisition of Forthnet marked our entry into the Greek
market and is expected to strengthen our position as an industry leader in Southeastern Europe.

In July 2020, we agreed to acquire the remaining 49% of Grand Production, and in addition, during the
course of 2020, we acquired, or signed binding offers to acquire, stakes in several companies in Serbia and
Slovenia for a total preliminary consideration of approximately €23 million. These transactions were
completed in March 2021.

In January 2021, we acquired Bulgaria’s largest multi-platform media company, Nova BG, from Advance
Media Group EAD for a consideration of €290.6 million. Nova BG’s operations comprise 10 television
channels, including NOVA TV which broadcasts throughout Bulgaria, Bulgaria’s largest online platform, Net
Info, that reaches on average 80% of the Bulgarian population each month, and four radio stations. Nova BG
had estimated last two quarters annualized revenue and adjusted EBITDA for March 31, 2021, of
approximately €152 million and €57 million, respectively.

In March 2021, we acquired Serbian newspaper Dan Graf (operating under the brand Danas) in order to
increase our footprint in print and digital media in the Serbian market.

Between April and June 2021, we signed agreements to acquire, or completed the acquisition of, the entire
share capital or stakes in various other companies, including local internet and TV operators Net 1 EOOD
and ComNet Sofia EAD, Digital Cable Television EOOD (N3), Serbian distribution company D Express,
local internet and TV operators Networx-Bulgaria EOOD, TVN Distribution Bulgaria EOOD and Telco
Infrastructures EOOD in Bulgaria, as well as Mainstream in Serbia.

On July 9, 2021, we announced that we reached an agreement to acquire a majority interest of 54.31% in
Croatian telecom operation Optima Telekom, based on an enterprise value of HRK 639 million. Optima
Telekom offers a broad range of fixed broadband internet services to approximately 117 thousand subscribers
and pay-TV services to approximately 57 thousand subscribers in Croatia. Completion of the Optima Telekom
Acquisition is expected for the end of 2021 and is subject to customary conditions as well as the
implementation of certain changes in the current Croatian telecommunication legislation relating to vertical
integration between pay-TV broadcasters and distributors, and thus there can be no assurance that the
acquisition will be completed by such expected date or at all. Once completed, the acquisition of Optima
Telekom will allow us to further expand our presence in the Croatian market enabling Telemach Croatia to
offer a full range of telecommunication services, including pay-TV, through its existing infrastructure. Optima
Telekom had estimated last two quarters annualized revenue and adjusted EBITDA for March 31, 2021 of
€60.1 million and €16.8 million, respectively. Following completion of the Optima Telekom Acquisition, we
expect to be required to undertake a tender offer for the remaining shares of Optima Telekom not yet acquired.

Acquisitions affect our results of operations in a variety of ways. Our results for the period during which an
acquisition takes place are affected by the inclusion or exclusion of the results of the acquired or disposed of
business in our consolidated results. In addition, the results of the acquired businesses after their acquisition
may be impacted positively by synergies. Additionally, we may experience an increase in operating expenses,
including staff cost, as we integrate the acquired business into our network. Acquisitions may also result in
higher levels of depreciation and amortization expense. Also, because acquired entities are consolidated from
the date of their acquisition and disposed of entities are no longer consolidated from the date of their
disposition, the full impact of an acquisition or disposition is only reflected in our financial statements in the
subsequent periods. As a result, the historical results of operations for the periods presented in this offering
memorandum may not be comparable with each other. See “Our Business—History” for a discussion of these
acquisitions.

**_Our Segment Reporting_**

We are a pan regional distribution platform of cable and satellite Pay-TV, broadband internet and telephony
services with various offerings in Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Montenegro,
North Macedonia and Greece. Our business has grown substantially in terms of scale, geographic reach and
service offering during the period under review through both organic growth and acquisitions. In addition,
the corporate organization of our business has changed during this period as our business has grown and
been integrated. As a consequence of these changes, our Group-level financial reporting has evolved during
the last several years.

In order to provide a meaningful analysis of our results of operations during the period under review, in
addition to a discussion of our Group-level consolidated results of operations based on IFRS measures, we


-----

also present a discussion of revenues, UG Adjusted EBITDA and UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure of our
business segments for the three months ended March 31, 2021, the three months ended March 31, 2020 and
the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020.

Under IFRS 8 “Operating Segments,” we present our segment data in the notes to the Company Audited
Financial Statements. In Note 7 to the 2020 Company Audited Financial Statements, we separately report
segment results for nine business segments:

- Serbia Group. This segment includes the results of cable services in Serbia and DTH operations in Serbia
and North Macedonia, including the results of Ikom (acquired in April 2017). This segment also includes
the results of Absolut Solutions, (although these results are not reflected in the statutory consolidated
results of SBB Serbia);

- Slovenia Group. This segment includes the results of our cable and mobile services and DTH operations in
Slovenia;

- Bosnia Group. This segment includes the results of our cable and DTH operations in Bosnia and
Herzegovina;

- Montenegro Group. This segment includes the results of our cable and DTH business in Montenegro;

- Media Group. This segment includes the results of our media and content business in Southeastern Europe
including the results of N1, Sport Klub, Grand Production, Pikaboo, IDJ Nova TV, Nova M and Nova BH
as well as Direct Media and Nova BG (from January 22, 2021);

- Croatia Group. This segment includes the results of Telemach Croatia from March 3, 2020;

- Bulgaria Group. This segment includes the results of Vivacom from July 31, 2020;

- Greece Group. This segment includes the results of Forthnet’s telecommunications operations from
November 12, 2020;

- Other segments. This includes our other operating business, Solford Trading Ltd. (which operates NetTV
Plus) and Shoppster, and our non-operating holding companies (United Group B.V., Adria Cable B.V.,
Adria Serbia Holdco B.V. and Slovenia Broadband S.à r.l.). Revenue reported under “Other” is mainly
generated by Solford Trading Ltd.

Our Media Group segment presents results for Nova BG (acquired on January 21, 2021) and Dan Graf
(acquired on March 10, 2021) from the respective date of consolidation with the Group’s results for the three
months ended March 31, 2021.

**_UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure_**

UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure represents capital expenditure, as adjusted by intragroup adjustments, the
application of IFRS 15 for acquisition costs in SBB Serbia, assets held for sale and overflow between periods.
UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure is prepared based on management accounts and not IFRS.

Intragroup adjustments relate to unrealized profit on the intragroup sale of end-user equipment by SBB
Serbia. When SBB Serbia sells this equipment to other Group companies in compliance with applicable
transfer pricing requirements, it makes an unrealized profit on the sale. These unrealized profits are eliminated
for the purposes of preparing our accounts in accordance with IFRS, but are not eliminated for the purpose
of our management accounts.

The application of IFRS 15 for acquisition costs in SBB Serbia reflects the additional effect of harmonizing
our accounting policy with respect to the capitalization of subscriber acquisition costs for rebinding, upselling
and cross-selling (which in the past were not eligible to be capitalized, but under IFRS 15 qualify for
capitalization), which were determined subsequent to the preparation of our management accounts.

Assets held for sale relate to programming rights acquired by Media Group for other Group Segments which
were recognized under IFRS as intangible assets and were invoiced to other Group segments after March 31,
2021.

Overflow between periods relates to the fact that our management accounts are closed prior to the closing of
our accounts prepared in accordance with IFRS. Overflow between periods in any given period reflects the
additional capital expenditure incurred between the preparation of our management accounts and our
accounts prepared in accordance with IFRS for such period.


-----

In this offering memorandum, we present UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure for the Company and for each of
the Company’s business segments for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, and for the
three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2021. See “Summary of Company and Group Run-Rate, Vivacom,
_Unaudited Pro Forma and Certain Other Financial Data” and “Reconciliation of Certain Financial Data_
_Presented Herein.” A reconciliation between the Company’s capital expenditure and UG Adjusted Capital_
Expenditure for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, and the three months ended March 31,
2021 is included elsewhere in this offering memorandum, under “Reconciliation of Certain Financial Data
_Presented Herein.” In addition, for informational purposes only, we describe our anticipated UG Adjusted_
Capital Expenditure for the year ended December 31, 2021 based on management estimates, which may vary
from our actual Group level capital expenditure data when it is prepared in accordance with IFRS.

UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure and future UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure estimates are prepared based
on management accounts rather than IFRS. One example of a difference in methodology used in preparing
the management account financial data (as compared to IFRS financial data) is that when determining UG
Adjusted Capital Expenditure relating to set-top boxes purchased by group companies, the expenditure is
treated as inventory until such set-top box is activated by the end-user, at which time it is treated as a fixed
asset. Under IFRS, however, this expenditure is required to be accounted for as a fixed asset from the moment
such set-top box is purchased. As a result, when presenting our segment level UG Adjusted Capital
Expenditure and our anticipated UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure for the periods presented in this offering
memorandum, we classify our expenditures relating to set-top boxes as inventory until such set-top boxes are
activated by the end-user.

**Key Operating Measures**

We use several key operating measures, including homes passed, unique subscribers, RGUs and ARPU, to
track the performance of our business. None of these terms are measures of financial performance under
IFRS, nor have these measures been reviewed by an outside auditor, consultant or expert. These measures are
derived from management information systems. As these terms are defined by our management, they may not
be comparable to similar terms used by other companies.

**_Unique Subscribers, RGUs and ARPU_**

Unique cable subscribers represent the number of individual end-users who have subscribed to one or more of
our cable-based services. In all of our cable markets, cable Pay-TV is the basic service that a cable unique
subscriber is typically required to subscribe to in order to receive the Group’s other services such as broadband
internet access and telephony, with the exception of Bulgaria. A unique cable subscriber may subscribe to
several different services, thereby accounting for only one unique cable subscriber, but several RGUs.

DTH subscribers represent the number of individuals across the six Southeastern European markets
(Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Montenegro and North Macedonia) who have
subscribed to our DTH Pay-TV services. We believe that most of these subscribers are outside of our cable
footprint. Typically, DTH subscribers are only able to subscribe to DTH based Pay-TV services and represent
a single RGU. However, we are re selling ADSL services purchased from our competitors in the respective
markets to DTH subscribers.

Average monthly revenue per user, or ARPU, is a measure we use to evaluate how effectively we are realizing
potential revenues from subscribers. ARPU is calculated by adding together, for each month in a given period,
the total subscription related revenues for that particular month divided by the average number of subscribers
for that month and then dividing that sum by the total number of months in the period.

The following table sets forth certain of our key operating measures as of and for the years ended
December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, and as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2021:

(1) Homes passed represents all homes (households) ready to be connected directly to our fixed-line network.

(2) Unique cable subscribers represent the number of individual end-users who have subscribed to one or more of our cable-based
services. In all of our cable markets, cable Pay-TV is the basic service that a cable unique subscriber is typically required to subscribe
to in order to receive the Group’s other services such as broadband internet access and telephony, with the exception of Bulgaria.
A unique cable subscriber may subscribe to several different services, thereby accounting for only one unique cable subscriber, but
several RGUs.

(3) Cable Pay-TV RGUs includes (i) the sum of our analog and digital cable Pay-TV RGUs in Slovenia, (ii) our total analog cable
Pay-TV RGUs (without separately counting analog cable RGUs that have purchased digital top ups) in Serbia, Bosnia and
Herzegovina and Montenegro and (iii) our analog and digital cable Pay-TV RGUs in Bulgaria.

(4) OTT consists of our NetTV Plus and out of footprint EON subscribers.

(5) Broadband internet RGUs represents residential broadband internet provided within our network footprint.

(6) Fixed-line telephony RGUs represents residential fixed-line telephony provided within our network footprint.

(7) Mobile RGUs represents mobile-telephony services provided to customers in Slovenia, where we have operated as an MNO since
our acquisition of Tušmobil in April 2015. Following completion of the acquisition of Tele2 Croatia in March 2020, we also
provide mobile-telephony services in Croatia, and following the completion of the acquisition of Vivacom in July 2020, we also
provide mobile-telephony services in Bulgaria.

(8) Other services include multichannel multipoint distribution service-based services, ADSL internet services and B2B services.

(9) RGU Penetration represents for cable Pay-TV the number of unique cable subscribers at the end of the relevant period as
a percentage of the number of homes passed by our network, and for broadband internet the number of RGUs at the end of the
relevant period as a percentage of the number of unique cable subscribers.

(10) Blended Cable ARPU is calculated by adding together, for each month in a given period, the total cable Pay-TV, broadband
internet and fixed-line telephony revenues (including fixed-line telephony usage revenues and excluding minor installation fees) for
that particular month divided by the average number of unique cable subscribers for that month and then dividing that sum by the
total number of months in the period. Blended Cable ARPU does not include mobile ARPU, which was €10.9 for the year ended
December 31, 2018, €10.8 for the year ended December 31, 2019, €9.5 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and €8.8 for the
three months ended March 31, 2021. We calculate mobile ARPU by adding together, for each month in a given period, the total
mobile-telephony revenues (excluding revenues generated by customers of other networks roaming on our network and excluding
wholesale revenues) for that particular month divided by the average number of mobile RGUs for that month and then dividing
that sum by the total number of months in the period. In addition, following the Vivacom Acquisition, we amended the definition
of certain key operating measures (Homes Passed, Unique Cable Subscribers and Blended Cable ARPU) in order to align the
calculation methodology across the Group. As a result, Bended Cable ARPU figures were restated for the periods starting from
January 1, 2018 onwards.

(11) As of January 1, 2019, we changed our reporting methodology in regards to certain key operating measures, which has resulted in
immaterial differences as compared to previous periods. For the year ended December 31, 2018, OTT users on our network have
been reclassified to Cable and Cable services users on other networks have been reclassified to Other Services from Cable. This
change has an immaterial effect on all subscriber, RGU, ARPU and churn data for the year ended December 31, 2018, and such key
operating measures have been restated for such periods in line with this new reporting methodology.

(1) Figures for the three months ended March 31, 2020 for our Croatia, Bulgaria and Greece segments are derived from management
accounts and are included for presentation purposes only, as the acquisition of Tele2 Croatia, the acquisition of Vivacom and the
acquisition of Forthnet were completed on March 3, 2020, July 31, 2020 and November 22, 2020, respectively.

(2) Homes passed represents all homes (households) ready to be connected directly to our fixed-line network.

(3) Unique cable subscribers represent the number of individual end-users who have subscribed to one or more of our cable-based
services. In all of our cable markets, cable Pay-TV is the basic service that a cable unique subscriber is typically required to subscribe
to in order to receive the Group’s other services such as broadband internet access and telephony, with the exception of Bulgaria.
A unique cable subscriber may subscribe to several different services, thereby accounting for only one unique cable subscriber, but
several RGUs.

(4) RGUs, or revenue generating units. Total RGUs are not equal to the total number of subscribers. For example, one subscriber who
receives cable Pay-TV and telephony services over our network is counted as two RGUs, and our subscriber who receives cable
Pay-TV, broadband internet and telephony services over our network is counted as three RGUs.

(5) Mobile RGUs represents mobile-telephony services provided to customers in Slovenia, where we have operated as an MNO since
our acquisition of Tušmobil in April 2015. Following completion of the acquisition of Tele2 Croatia in March 2020, we also
provide mobile-telephony services in Croatia, and following completion of the acquisition of Vivacom in July 2020, we also provide
mobile-telephony services in Bulgaria.

(6) Other services include multichannel multipoint distribution service-based services, ADSL internet services and B2B services.

_Group—Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018_

Homes passed increased by 19 thousand, or 1%, from 1,833 thousand as of December 31, 2018 to
1,852 thousand as of December 31, 2019, primarily due to organic network expansion.

to 1,166 thousand as of December 31, 2018, primarily due to organic growth.

The total number of DTH Pay-TV RGUs amounted to 446 thousand as of December 31, 2019, a 4% decrease
as compared to 463 as of December 31, 2018, primarily due to increased competition, migration from DTH

The total number of fixed-telephony RGUs increased to 695 thousand as of December 31, 2019, an increase
of 8%, compared to 644 thousand as of December 31, 2018. This positive trend is primarily due to an increase
in multi-play subscriptions and organic subscriber growth. Our fixed-line telephony RGUs as of December 31,
2018 have been restated by 17 thousand RGUs, from 661 thousand RGUs to 644 thousand RGUs, due to the


-----

reclassification of fixed-line telephony RGUs outside our network footprint to Other services. This
reclassification mainly involved Telemach Slovenia, affecting 14 thousand fixed-line telephony RGUs.

Our OTT RGUs as of December 31, 2019 increased by 2% to 124 thousand, compared to 122 thousand as of
December 31, 2018, primarily due to new content offered to customers. This figure includes 13 thousand OTT

Our total RGUs increased by 3%, from 3,788 thousand as of December 31, 2018 to 3,917 thousand as of
December 31, 2019. RGUs added over this period were a result of the organic growth of cable Pay-TV,
telephony, mobile, internet and other services, as well as a growing proportion of multi-play subscribers.

(1) Figures for the three months ended March 31, 2020 for our Croatia, Bulgaria and Greece segments are derived from management
accounts and are included for presentation purposes only, as the acquisition of Tele2 Croatia, the acquisition of Vivacom and the
acquisition of Forthnet were completed on March 3, 2020, July 31, 2020 and November 12, 2020, respectively.

(2) Our ARPU is presented in euro per month (excluding VAT) for the periods indicated. ARPU from broadband internet includes
value added services subscriptions, including online backup, internet security and anti-virus services.

(3) In August 2019, mobile interconnection revenues (€40 thousand) were reclassified as telephony interconnection revenues.

(4) Blended Cable ARPU is calculated by adding together, for each month in a given period, the total cable Pay-TV, broadband
internet and fixed-line telephony revenues (including fixed-line telephony usage revenues and excluding minor installation fees) for
that particular month divided by the average number of unique cable subscribers for that month and then dividing that sum by the
total number of months in the period. Blended Cable ARPU does not include mobile ARPU, which was €10.9 for the year ended
December 31, 2018, €10.8 for the year ended December 31, 2019, €9.5 for the year ended December 31, 2020, €11.0 for the
three months ended March 31, 2020 and €8.8 for the three months ended March 31, 2021. We calculate mobile ARPU by adding
together, for each month in a given period, the total mobile-telephony revenues (excluding revenues generated by customers of
other networks roaming on our network and excluding wholesale revenues) for that particular month divided by the average number
of mobile RGUs for that month and then dividing that sum by the total number of months in the period. In addition, following the
acquisition of Vivacom, we amended the definition of certain key operating measures (Homes Passed, Unique Cable Subscribers
and Blended Cable ARPU) in order to align the calculation methodology across the Group. As a result, Bended Cable ARPU
figures were restated for the periods starting from January 1, 2018 onwards.

(5) The figures for Vivacom’s blended cable ARPU included in the table above are calculated in line with our methodology. Therefore,
such amounts can differ from Vivacom’s standalone figures calculated as per their own methodology.

_Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 Compared to the Three Months Ended March 31, 2020_

_Slovenia segment._ Blended cable ARPU for Telemach Slovenia and mobile ARPU for the Slovenia segment
remained stable for the three months ended March 31, 2021, at €35.4 and €10.9, respectively. DTH ARPU for
Telemach Slovenia increased to €18.9 in the three months ended March 31, 2021, from €18.3 in the

_Serbia segment._ Blended cable ARPU for SBB Serbia in the three months ended March 31, 2021 amounted
to €20.2. The 1% period on period decrease was primarily the result of the negative accounting impact of


-----

IFRS 15. DTH ARPU for SBB Serbia decreased to €9.5 in the three months ended March 31, 2021, from
€10.3 in the three months ended March 31, 2020, as the result of the same negative accounting impact from
the implementation of IFRS 15.

_Bosnia and Herzegovina segment._ Blended cable ARPU for Telemach BH in the three months ended
March 31, 2021 decreased by 4.7% period on period to €21.4, mainly due to the negative accounting impact
from the implementation of IFRS 15. DTH ARPU at Telemach of €1.5 million, Bosnia in the three months
ended March 31, 2021 decreased to €8.7 million, compared to €10.1 million in the three months ended

impact of a price increase in March 2020.

_Montenegro segment._ Blended cable ARPU for Telemach MNE in the three months ended March 31, 2021
increased by 1% period on period to €19.0, mainly as a result of growth in the number of subscribers for the
multi-play offering. DTH ARPU at Telemach MNE decreased to €10.7 in the three months ended March 31,
2021, from €11.3 in the three months ended March 31, 2020, mainly due to the higher number of subscribers
with expired discounts in the contract period as reported under IFRS 15.

_Croatia segment._ Mobile ARPU for Telemach Croatia in the three months ended March 31, 2021 decreased

_Bulgaria segment._ Blended cable ARPU for Vivacom in the three months ended March 31, 2021 increased
by 4.2% compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020, to €10.5 mainly resulting from the growing
share of pay-TV tariffs with higher monthly recurring fees and additional packages including rich content
and sports channels. Vivacom’s mobile ARPU increased to €7.3 in the three months ended March 31, 2021,
up from €6.8 in the three months ended March 31, 2020 mainly due to the increase in data usage with growing
demand for mobile data. DTH ARPU for Vivacom increased to €9.1 in the first three months ended March 31,
2021, up from €8.6 in the first three months ended March 31, 2020 mainly due to take-up of tariffs with more
content and additional sports channels.

Greece segment. DTH ARPU for Forthnet decreased to €17.8 in the three months ended March 31, 2021,
compared to €20.2 in the three months ended March 31, 2020 mainly due to the closure of B2B businesses
(mainly Bar/ Café) as a result of the implementation of COVID-19 lockdowns as of mid-January. During the
lockdown period, these businesses were not charged while remaining in the active base. The ARPU impact
due to the lockdown of small and medium enterprises is estimated at €(2.59) million.

multi-play offering. DTH ARPU at Telemach MNE increased to €11.8 in the year ended December 31, 2019,
from €10.7 in the year ended December 31, 2018, as a result of a price increase in January 2019.

**Description of Key Line Items**

**_Revenue._** Revenues are generated from the following services: cable television, broadband internet, DTHTV, value added services (such as OTT), telephony subscriptions and telephony usage, content and other
sources (primarily related to the sale of end-user equipment). Revenues generated from our bundle
subscriptions are allocated to the individual products of standard cable, broadband internet and telephony
subscriptions based on the individual product prices for each product as a percentage of the sum of the
individual product prices. Revenue for these services is charged and recognized in the period in which these
services are provided. We recognize revenues for connection fees upon delivery of installation and we defer
and amortize connection fees over the average remaining useful life of the customer relationship.

**_Other income._** Other income arises mainly from subventions, reversal of provision for legal cases, charged
legal cases and other activities nor related to the ordinary course of business.

**_Content costs._** Content costs include author rights and royalties we pay to procure our content, and include
fees paid to channel providers, primarily related to foreign television channels. Our content fees are
predominantly determined on a flat monthly amount and to a lesser extent on a per subscriber basis.

**_Satellite capacity costs._** Satellite capacity costs relate to the lease of satellite capacity from third-party
providers, which currently is EUTELSAT. These costs are impacted by the type and amount of commercial
discounts obtained from satellite providers. With effect from January 1, 2019, satellite capacity costs are
presented under depreciation (right-of-use assets) and finance costs due to the adoption of IFRS 16.

**_Link and interconnection costs._** These costs relate to fees payable in order to transfer data over third-party
networks. Internet connection links are leased from various parties.

**_Cost of end-user equipment and other material costs._** Cost of end-user equipment and other material costs
includes costs to procure set-top boxes, other products, such as telephones and routers, and materials used to
connect subscribers to our network. Prior to January 1, 2020, these costs were recorded under the line item
“Material costs.”

**_Staff cost._** Staff cost includes wages and salaries, social security costs, pension costs and other postemployment benefits and the cost of temporary and external personnel, adjusted for own work capitalized
based on direct labor hours spent on projects which are capitalized.


-----

**_Media buying._** Media buying includes expenses incurred by Direct Media in the territories of Serbia,
Montenegro, Albania and North Macedonia. As a leading media network in Southeastern Europe, Direct
Media provides international and local partners with integrated communication, advertising and media
services.

**_Depreciation cost._** Depreciation cost relates to the depreciation and impairment of our property, plant and
equipment over their useful lives.

**_Amortization of intangible assets._** Amortization of intangible assets relates to the amortization and
impairment of our intangible assets over their useful lives. Our intangible assets include our customer base
and direct subscriber acquisition costs, which, for our cable and DTH customers, are capitalized and
amortized over the estimated useful life of the customer relationship. For our mobile customers, subscriber
acquisition costs are capitalized and amortized over a twenty four month period (the estimated life of the
post-paid customer contract), while our mobile customer base is capitalized and amortized over its estimated
useful life. Intangible assets also include goodwill, computer software, licenses and content such as sport
rights.

**_Amortization of right-of-use assets._** Amortization of right-of-use assets relates to depreciation of right-ofuse assets over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.

**_Other operating expenses._** Other operating expenses include rent of premises, poles and ducts, marketing
and promotion expenses, legal and administrative fees and maintenance costs and other costs. With effect
from January 1, 2019, other operating expenses excludes media buying expenses, which are included under the
separate line item “Media buying.”

**_Operating income._** Operating income represents the amount of profit from business operations, and includes
total revenues less total operating expenses (which contains cost of goods sold, personnel expenses, contracted
work, materials and logistics, marketing and sales, office expenses, other operating expenses, amortization,
depreciation and impairments).

**_Finance income._** Finance income includes interest income on funds invested (including short-term bank
deposits) and foreign currency gains.

**_Finance costs._** Finance costs include interest expense on borrowings and foreign currency losses.

**_Income tax credit/(expense)._** Income tax credit/(expense) comprises current and deferred income tax and is

income.

ended March 31, 2021, from €193,974 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This increase
was primarily due to the acquisitions completed during 2020 (Tele2 Croatia, Vivacom, Forthnet and Nova
BG), as well as continued successful cross-selling and price increases.

Vivacom Acquisition and the Forthnet Acquisition, as applicable.


-----

_Slovenia Group segment._ Revenue for our Slovenia Group segment increased by €3,321 thousand, or 6%, to
€61,191 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from €57,870 thousand for the three months
ended March 31, 2020. This increase was due to higher mobile revenues as a result of an increased number of
subscribers, price increases in March and October 2020, higher internet revenues (successful upselling and
migration from legacy EON packages with higher internet ARPU) and higher mobile handset revenues.

_Serbia Group segment._ Revenue for our Serbia Group segment decreased by €689 thousand, or 1%, to
€56,052 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from €56,741 thousand for the three months
ended March 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to the negative accounting impact from the
implementation of IFRS 15 on video and internet services.

_Bosnia Group segment._ Revenue for our Bosnia Group segment decreased by €736 thousand, or 4%, to
€18,052 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from €18,788 thousand for the three months
ended March 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to the negative accounting impact from the
implementation of IFRS 15 on video and internet services of €989 thousand, partially offset by higher DTH
video and internet subscription revenues.

_Montenegro Group segment._ Revenue for our Montenegro Group segment decreased by €171 thousand, or
5%, to €3,194 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from €3,365 thousand for the
three months ended March 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to a continued decline in the number
DTH subscribers.

_Croatia Group segment._ Revenue for our Croatia Group segment was €43,770 thousand for the three months
ended March 31, 2021. Tele2 Croatia was acquired and consolidated into United Group as of March 2020.

_Bulgaria Group segment. Revenue for our Bulgaria Group segment was €129,604 thousand for the_
three months ended March 31, 2021. Vivacom was acquired and consolidated into United Group as of
July 2020.

_Greece Group segment._ Revenue for our Greece Group segment was €62,122 thousand for the three months
ended March 31, 2021. Forthnet was acquired and consolidated into United Group as of November 2020.

_Media Group segment._ External revenue for our Media Group segment increased by 53% to
€56,769 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to €37,169 thousand in the
three months ended March 31, 2020, mainly due to the Nova Broadcasting Group Acquisition, which was
completed in January 2021. Total revenues of the Media Group segment (including intercompany revenues)
increased by 36% year-on-year, to €84,646 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2021.

_Other._ Revenue from our Other segment increased €4,024 thousand, or 88%, to €8,603 thousand for the
three months ended March 31, 2021, from €4,579 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This
increase was primarily due to the launch of the Shoppster e-commerce platform during 2020.

_Other income._ Other income increased by €73 thousand, or 4%, to €1,796 thousand for the three months
ended March 31, 2021, from €1,723 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2020.

_Content costs._ Content costs increased by €19,615 thousand, or 69%, to €48,166 thousand for the
three months ended March 31, 2021, from €28,551 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This
increase was primarily due to the content costs of newly acquired channels.

_Link and interconnection costs._ Link and interconnection costs increased by €33,226 thousand, or 291%, to
€44,660 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from €11,434 thousand for the three months
ended March 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of Vivacom, Forthnet and Tele2
Croatia.

_Cost of end-user equipment and other material costs._ Cost of end-user equipment and other material costs
increased by €31,010 thousand, or 183%, to €47,974 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2021,
from €16,964 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to higher
cost of sales for mobile handsets (mainly due to the acquisitions of Vivacom and Tele2 Croatia), the higher
cost of end-user equipment, higher energy and fuel costs mainly as a result of acquisitions, as well as higher
costs of goods sold (mainly relating to goods sold by Shoppster, which started operations in 2020).

_Staff cost._ Staff cost increased by €33,805 thousand, or 157%, to €55,342 thousand for the three months
ended March 31, 2021, from €21,537 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This increase was
mainly the result of the increase in staff cost due to the higher number of employees resulting from
acquisitions in 2020 and 2021.


-----

_Media buying._ Media buying costs increased by €473 thousand, or 6%, to €8,417 thousand for the
three months ended March 31, 2021, from €7,944 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This
increase was mainly a result of the Nova Broadcasting Group Acquisition, which offset the effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic (that is, which led to lower media buying volumes by Direct Media due to decreased
overall advertising spend).

_Depreciation._ Depreciation increased by €30,448 thousand, or 112%, to €57,574 thousand for the
three months ended March 31, 2021, from €27,126 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This
increase was primarily due to the addition of tangible assets as a result of the acquisitions in 2020 and 2021.

_Depreciation (right-of-use assets)._ Depreciation (rights of use assets) increased by €10,249 thousand, or
185%, to €15,799 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from €5,550 thousand for the
three months ended March 31, 2020. This increase was due to the acquisitions completed in 2020 and 2021.

_Amortization of intangible assets._ Amortization of intangible assets increased by €43,893 thousand, or 197%,
to €66,147 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from €22,254 thousand for the three months
ended March 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the addition of intangible assets through the
acquisitions completed in 2020 and 2021.

_Other operating expenses._ Other operating expenses increased by €32,480 thousand, or 106%, to
€63,110 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from €30,630 thousand for the three months
ended March 31, 2020. While all cost categories saw an increase, the largest increases were in maintenance,
license fee and marketing and promotion costs.

_Net finance costs._ Net finance costs increased by €4,189 thousand, or 13%, to €37,562 thousand for the
three months ended March 31, 2021, from €33,373 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This
increase was primarily due to higher interest expense related to new bond issuances.

_Loss before tax._ Loss before tax decreased by €4,712 thousand, or 39%, to €7,233 thousand for the
three months ended March 31, 2021, from €11,945 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This
change was primarily due to increased operating profit, which partially offset the higher net finance costs.

_Income tax expense._ Income tax expense increased by €1,254 thousand, or 88%, to €2,687 thousand for the
three months ended March 31, 2021, from €1,433 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2020.

_UG Adjusted EBITDA and UG Adjusted EBITDA Margin._ UG Adjusted EBITDA increased by
€94,570 thousand, or 112%, to €179,164 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from
€84,594 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the impact
of the acquisitions of Tele2 Croatia, Vivacom and Forthnet, which were completed in March 2020, July 2020
and November 2020, respectively, as well as due to the organic growth of our subscriber base, price increases,
continued successful cross-selling, migration of subscribers to multiplay packages and effective cost discipline.

UG Adjusted EBITDA Margin decreased to 41% for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from 44% for
the three months ended March 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to the contribution of Telemach
Croatia and Vivacom which had lower UG Adjusted EBITDA Margin as compared to our other segments, as
well as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We discuss below UG Adjusted EBITDA by segment for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared
to the three months ended March 31, 2020.

_Slovenia Group segment._ UG Adjusted EBITDA increased by €1,284 thousand, or 6%, to €23,114 thousand
for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from €21,830 thousand for the three months ended March 31,
2020. This increase was primarily due to the organic growth of fixed and mobile RGUs, price increases in
March 2020 (of mobile services) and October 2020 (of both mobile and fixed services) as well as the
acquisition of 12 thousand unique video subscribers in the year ended December 31, 2020.

_Serbia Group segment._ UG Adjusted EBITDA decreased by €1,509 thousand, or 5%, to €31,041 thousand
for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from €32,550 thousand for the three months ended March 31,
2020. This decrease was primarily due to the negative accounting impact on our revenues from the
implementation of IFRS 15.

_Bosnia Group segment._ UG Adjusted EBITDA increased by €645 thousand, or 10%, to €7,123 thousand for
the three months ended March 31, 2021, from €6,478 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2020.
This increase was primarily due to lower programming costs resulting from the non-renewal of our contract


-----

with Arenasport, which generated estimated cost savings of €1,299 thousand. This increase was partly offset
by the negative accounting impact on our revenues from the implementation of IFRS 15.

_Montenegro Group segment._ UG Adjusted EBITDA increased by €73 thousand, or 10%, to €809 thousand
for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from €736 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2020.
This increase was primarily due to 13 lower direct costs and lower operational costs, which more than offset
the 5% decrease in revenues due to the negative accounting impact from the implementation of IFRS 15.

_Media Group segment._ UG Adjusted EBITDA increased by €6,567 thousand, or 36%, to €24,928 thousand
for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from €18,361 thousand for the three months ended March 31,
2020. This increase was primarily due to the integration of Nova BG in the Media Group segment, following
its acquisition in February 2021, which was partially offset by a decrease in revenues due to the non-extension
of certain carriage fee arrangements in Slovenia and Bosnia and increased costs relating to the enhancement
of our content offering in those markets.

_Croatia Group segment._ UG Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was
€15,089 thousand.

_Bulgaria Group segment._ UG Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was
€61,488 thousand.

_Greece segment._ UG Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was €18,136 thousand.

_Slovenia Group segment._ Revenue for our Slovenia Group segment increased by €7,567 thousand, or 3%, to
€237,129 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €229,562 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to an increase in internet revenues (a result of successful
upselling and migration from legacy to EON packages with higher internet ARPU), higher mobile revenues
as a result of an increased number of subscribers and price increases in March and October 2020 and higher
mobile handset and other revenues (taking into account the effects of IFRS 15 and COVID-19-related
government subsidies).

_Serbia Group segment._ Revenue for our Serbia Group segment increased by €3,698 thousand, or 2%, to
€223,697 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €219,999 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to growth in the number of subscribers and and multiplay packages (particularly through successful cross-selling).

_Bosnia Group segment._ Revenue for our Bosnia Group segment decreased by €115 thousand, to
€72,537 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €72,652 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to the accounting impact from the implementation of
IFRS 15 (primarily in relation to video and internet services).

_Montenegro Group segment._ Revenue for our Montenegro Group segment decreased by €992 thousand, or
7%, to €13,307 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €14,299 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2019. This decrease was mainly due to a lower number of DTH subscribers in 2020.

_Media Group segment._ External revenue for our Media Group decreased by €26,206 thousand, or 14%, to
€158,886 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €185,092 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2019. This decrease was due to the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily in the advertising and
media selling businesses. Total revenues of the Media Group segment (including intercompany revenues)
decreased by 5.3% year-on-year to €267,187 thousand in the year ended December 31, 2020.

_Other income._ Other income decreased by €1,508 thousand, or 17%, to €7,406 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2020, from €8,914 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019.

_Content costs._ Content costs increased by €6,321 thousand, or 5%, to €130,533 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2020, from €124,212 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was
primarily due to the content costs of newly acquired channels.

_Link and interconnection costs._ Link and interconnection costs increased by €53,406 thousand, or 140%, to
€91,557 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €38,151 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to higher mobile link and interconnection costs due to
acquisitions in the period.

_Cost of end-user equipment and other material cost._ Material costs increased by €95,512 thousand, or 190%,
to €145,781 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €50,269 thousand for the year ended


-----

December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the higher cost of sales for mobile handsets (mainly
due to the acquisitions of Vivacom and Tele2 Croatia), higher cost of goods sold (mainly in relation to goods
sold by Shoppster, which started operations in 2020) and higher energy and fuel costs mainly as a result of
acquisitions.

_Staff cost._ Staff cost increased by €32,712 thousand, or 32%, to €134,820 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2020, from €102,108 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was
primarily due to the impact of additional staff costs from acquired companies. Staff costs in 2019 were
impacted by a one-time non-charge of €21,659 thousand resulting from the application of IFRS 2 in relation
to a long-term incentive scheme (LTIS).

_Media buying._ Media buying costs decreased by €1,513 thousand, or 4%, to €38,168 thousand for the year
ended December 31, 2020, from €39,681 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was
primarily due to generally lower advertising expenditures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

_Depreciation._ Depreciation increased by €54,891 thousand, or 51%, to €161,719 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2020, from €106,828 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was
primarily due to the acquisition of new tangible assets as a result of the acquisitions of Vivacom, Forthnet
and Tele2 Croatia.

_Depreciation (right-of-use assets)._ Depreciation (right-of-use assets) was €42,793 thousand for the year
ended December 31, 2020, compared to €17,972 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase
of €24,821, or 138%. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of Vivacom, Forthnet and Tele2
Croatia.

_Amortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets increased by €60,998 thousand, or 74%,_
to €143,278 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €82,280 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the addition of intangible assets of acquired
companies.

_Other operating expenses._ Other operating expenses increased by €79,819 thousand, or 67%, to
€199,221 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €119,402 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to higher legal and advisory fees (including related to
acquisition-related activities) and higher maintenance and license fee costs which mainly resulted from the
acquisitions of Vivacom, Forthnet and Tele2 Croatia.

_Net finance costs._ Net finance costs increased by €28,736 thousand, or 28%, to €133,005 thousand for the
year ended December 31, 2020, from €104,269 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase
was primarily due to higher interest expense related to new bond issuances .

_Loss before tax._ Loss before tax increased by €11,914 thousand, or 23%, to €64,536 thousand for the year
ended December 31, 2020, from €52,622 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was
primarily due to increased net finance costs, which more than offset the operating profit increase of
€16,822 thousand.

_Income tax expense._ Income tax expense increased by €476 thousand, or 6%, to €7,890 thousand for the
year ended December 31, 2020, from €7,414 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019.

_UG Adjusted EBITDA and UG Adjusted EBITDA Margin._ UG Adjusted EBITDA increased by
€185,944 thousand, or 63%, to €481,338 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, from
€295,394 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to an increase in
revenues as a result of acquisitions completed in 2020, the organic growth of our subscribers, price increases,
continued cross-selling as well as effective cost discipline.

UG Adjusted EBITDA Margin increased to 41% for the year ended December 31, 2020, from 40% for the
year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the impact of the Media Group segment which had lower
UG Adjusted EBITDA Margin in 2019 as compared to 2018, largely as a result of Telemach Croatia and
Vivacom which had lower UG Adjusted EBITDA Margin as compared to our other segments, as well as the
negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We discuss below UG Adjusted EBITDA by segment for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the
year ended December 31, 2019.

_Slovenia Group segment._ UG Adjusted EBITDA increased by €15,295 thousand, or 21%, to
€89,399 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €74,104 thousand for the year ended


-----

December 31, 2019, primarily due to the organic growth of fixed and mobile RGUs and the price increase of
mobile services in March and October 2020 and fixed services in October 2020.

_Serbia Group segment._ UG Adjusted EBITDA increased by €10,064 thousand, or 9%, to €127,007 thousand
for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €116,943 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019,
primarily due to higher revenues from the organic growth of our subscriber base through cross-selling and
strict cost control, which was partially offset by increased programming costs.

_Bosnia Group segment._ UG Adjusted EBITDA decreased by €2,420 thousand, or 9%, to €23,993 thousand
for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €26,413 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019. This
decrease was primarily due to higher programming costs resulting from the introduction of the new channel
Nova BH, with an annual cost of €2,474 thousand and increased costs for our Sportklub channels. The
increase in programming costs was partly offset by savings achieved on other operating expenses.

_Montenegro Group segment._ UG Adjusted EBITDA decreased by €487 thousand, or 15%, to
€2,732 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €3,219 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2019, primarily due to a 7% decrease in revenues, which was only partially offset by decreased
costs and operating expenses.

_Media Group segment._ UG Adjusted EBITDA decreased by €2,255 thousand, or 3%, to €77,874 thousand
for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €80,129 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019,
primarily due to the decrease in total revenues as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily in the
advertising and media selling businesses.

_Slovenia Group segment._ Revenue for our Slovenia Group segment increased by €10,093 thousand, or 5%, to
€229,562 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €219,469 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to an increased number of mobile-telephony subscribers,
increased mobile handset sales and price increases in February 2019 in fixed-telephony.

_Serbia Group segment._ Revenue for our Serbia Group segment increased by €14,865 thousand, or 7%, to
€219,999 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €205,134 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to growth in the number of subscribers and RGUs
(particularly through cross-selling) and the implementation of a price increase in January 2019.

_Bosnia Group segment._ Revenue for our Bosnia Group segment increased by €4,911 thousand, or 7%, to
€72,652 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €67,741 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to organic growth, an increase in the number of
subscribers for our multi-play offering (digital TV, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony), and price
increases in April 2019.

_Montenegro Group segment._ Revenue for our Montenegro Group segment increased by €597 thousand, or
4%, to €14,299 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €13,702 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of multi-play subscribers.

_Media Group segment._ Revenue for our Media Group increased by €76,083 thousand, or 70%, to
€185,092 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €109,009 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of multi-play subscribers
and organic growth in both carriage fees and advertising, and the contribution from the acquisitions of Direct
Media in September 2018 and Nova TV.

_Other income._ Other income decreased by €6,415 thousand, or 42%, to €8,914 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2019, from €15,329 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was
primarily due to the divestment of Totalna TV Croatia in the first quarter of 2018.

_Content costs._ Content costs increased by €20,938 thousand, or 20%, to €124,212 thousand for the year
ended December 31, 2019, from €103,274 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was
primarily due to United Media’s acquisitions of TV channels (Nova TV in Croatia, Bosnia & Herzegovina
and Montenegro) and increased sports rights costs.

_Satellite capacity costs._ With effect from January 1, 2019, satellite capacity costs are presented under
depreciation and finance costs due to the adoption of IFRS 16.


-----

_Link and interconnection costs._ Link and interconnection costs decreased by €2,903 thousand, or 7%, to
€38,151 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €41,054 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to lower mobile link and interconnection costs.

_Cost of end-user equipment and other material cost._ Material costs increased by €4,646 thousand, or 10%, to
€50,269 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €45,623 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to the higher cost of sales for mobile handsets as a result
of increased sales volumes and higher energy and fuel costs.

_Staff cost._ Staff cost increased by €3,097 thousand, or 3%, to €102,108 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2019, from €99,011 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily
due to the impact of additional staff costs from acquired companies. Out of the total amount of staff cost in
the year ended December 31, 2019, €21,659 thousand related to the non-cash impact of the application of
IFRS 2 in relation to an LTIS and was the main driver of increased staff costs, as compared to
€32,809 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018. On May 16, 2018, the shareholders of our former
ultimate holding company, Adria LuxCo S.à r.l. entered into the LTIS for the benefit of certain members of
our current and future management team. The LTIS consisted of a payment by the shareholders of Adria
LuxCo S.à r.l. following completion of an initial public offering or a sale of the Group. The amount of the
payment was calculated as a percentage of the proceeds received by the shareholders of Adria LuxCo S.à r.l.
and is based on the accumulated return on investment achieved by such shareholders. In addition, the increase
was due in part to our continued expansion, both organic and through acquisitions, of the Group during
2018.

_Media buying._ Media buying costs increased by €19,661 thousand, or 98%, to €39,681 thousand for the year
ended December 31, 2019, from €20,020 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was
primarily due to the full-year effect of the acquisition of Direct Media in September 2018.

_Depreciation._ Depreciation increased by €7,186 thousand, or 7%, to €106,828 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2019, from €99,642 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily
due to the expansion of our cable and mobile networks, increased investment in own produced content and
new assets from acquisitions.

_Depreciation (right-of-use assets)._ Depreciation (right-of-use assets) was €17,972 thousand for the year
ended December 31, 2019, compared to nil for the year ended December 31, 2018. This was due to the result
of the implementation of IFRS 16 on January 1, 2019.

_Amortization of intangible assets._ Amortization of intangible assets increased by €13,797 thousand, or 20%,
to €82,280 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €68,483 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to increased investments in programming rights and own
production, as well as the addition of intangible assets of acquired companies.

_Other operating expenses._ Other operating expenses decreased by €4,639 thousand, or 4%, to
€119,402 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €124,041 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to the implementation of IFRS 16 and lower legal and
advisory fees related to M&A activities.

_Net finance costs._ Net finance costs increased by €40,607 thousand, or 64%, to €104,269 thousand for the
year ended December 31, 2019, from €63,662 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase
was primarily due to higher interest expenses and costs of an early redemption option that was exercised in
the January 2020.

_Loss before tax._ Loss before tax increased by €9,669 thousand, or 23%, to €52,622 thousand for the year
ended December 31, 2019, from €42,953 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was
primarily due to increased finance costs.

_Income tax expense._ Income tax expense increased by €4,368 thousand, or 143%, to €7,414 thousand for the
year ended December 31, 2019, from €3,046 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase
was primarily due to a decrease in deferred tax as a consequence of the merger of SBB with IKOM and a
higher level of income tax expense.

_UG Adjusted EBITDA and UG Adjusted EBITDA Margin._ UG Adjusted EBITDA increased by
€34,768 thousand, or 13%, to €295,394 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, from
€260,626 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to an increase in
revenues as a result of the organic growth of our subscribers, price increases, continued cross-selling, effective


-----

cost discipline, and the impact of acquisitions of Nova TV (Croatia, Bosnia and Montenegro) and media
selling companies (Serbia) in the second half of 2018.

UG Adjusted EBITDA Margin decreased to 40% for the year ended December 31, 2019, from 41% for the
year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the impact of the Media Group segment which had lower
UG Adjusted EBITDA Margin in 2019 as compared to 2018, largely as a result of acquisitions.

We discuss below UG Adjusted EBITDA by segment for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the
year ended December 31, 2018.

_Slovenia Group segment._ UG Adjusted EBITDA increased by €2,674 thousand, or 4%, to €74,104 thousand
for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €71,430 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018,
primarily due to the organic growth of mobile RGUs and the price increase of mobile services in
December 2018 and fixed services in February 2019.

_Serbia Group segment._ UG Adjusted EBITDA increased by €3,919 thousand, or 3%, to €116,943 thousand
for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €113,024 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018,
primarily due to higher revenues from the organic growth of our subscriber base and a price increase in
January 2019, which was partially offset by increased programming costs and strict cost control.

_Bosnia Group segment._ UG Adjusted EBITDA increased by €2,982 thousand, or 13%, to €26,413 thousand
for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €23,431 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018,
primarily due to a revenue increase driven by price increases for subscriptions for the Bosnia Group’s cable
platform in April 2018 and April 2019 and satellite platform in January 2019, and an increase in the number
of subscribers with higher priced subscriptions.

_Montenegro Group segment._ UG Adjusted EBITDA decreased by €107 thousand, or 3%, to €3,219 thousand
for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €3,326 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily
due to an increase in direct costs and operational expenses which offset the revenue increase resulting from the
organic growth of the subscriber base and the increase in the number of multi-play subscribers.

_Media Group segment._ UG Adjusted EBITDA increased by €28,710 thousand, or 56%, to €80,129 thousand
for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €51,419 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018,
primarily due to the contribution of the acquisitions of Nova TV (Croatia, Bosnia, and Montenegro) and
media selling companies in Serbia in the second half of 2018, offset by organic growth in 2019 due to increased
carriage revenues.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Our primary sources of liquidity and funds for UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure, acquisitions and other
investments are operating cash flow, the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, potential additional issuances of
debt securities, ancillary and bilateral lending facilities and finance leases. Our ability to generate cash from
our operations will depend on our future operating performance, which is in turn dependent, to some extent,
on general economic, financial, competitive, market, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond
our control.

We maintain cash and cash equivalents to fund the day-to-day requirements of our business. We hold cash
primarily in euros as well as Serbian dinars, Bosnian marks, Bulgarian levs and Croatian kuna.

Historically, we have relied primarily on our the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and bilateral bank facilities,
other debt facilities and cash flow from operations to provide funds required for investments in UG Adjusted
Capital Expenditure and operations.

As of March 31, 2021, we had €166.0 million of cash and cash equivalents.

As of March 31, 2021, we had €3,388 million of outstanding indebtedness (excluding lease liabilities) on a
historical basis. This included, as of March 31, 2021, €3,300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of
Existing Notes (excluding transactions costs and fees related to the issuance thereof) along with the partially
drawn Existing Revolving Credit Facility of €73.0 million, a €10.0 million unsecured bilateral revolving credit
facility in Serbia, other financial liabilities related to bank secured loans of €2.9 million and finance leases of
€2.0 million. This amount excludes €289.7 million of lease liabilities and €287.6 million of lease liabilities that
would have been considered operating leases prior to the adoption of IFRS 16. After giving effect to the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility 2021 Increase, we expect to have up to €325 million of commitments under
the Existing Revolving Credit Facility.


-----

On an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the Offering and the use of proceeds therefrom and the other
transactions described under “Capitalization,” as of March 31, 2021, the Company would have had
€3,736 million of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis (excluding lease liabilities). The terms of
the Indentures permit the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to incur substantial additional indebtedness,
including in respect of borrowings by the Company or any of (in the case of the Indentures) its restricted
subsidiaries under any Credit Facility (as defined in the Indentures) of up to the greater of €570 million and
100% of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Indenture).

**UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure**

UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure relates primarily to the purchase of property and equipment, including
expansion of our network in terms of capacity and new homes connected, purchase of modems and set-top
boxes to be installed in customer premises, growth in RGUs and maintenance of our cable and mobile
networks and infrastructure, purchase of intangible assets such as content, software, investments in our core
infrastructure and systems to facilitate the addition of new services and acquisitions. Therefore, UG Adjusted
Capital Expenditure is primarily driven by extending, upgrading and maintaining our cable and mobile
networks, the installation and in home wiring for new subscribers, the cost of cable modems, including highspeed modems for subscribers to our high-speed broadband internet, and the acquisition of content. UG
Adjusted Capital Expenditure has also historically included certain investments of a non-recurring nature, as
well as costs to integrate acquired businesses.

UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure also includes increases in intangible assets (except our customer list and
brand names) and does not include financial assets. As part of our strategy to focus on UG Adjusted Capital
Expenditure improving returns, we implemented measures to ensure a more efficient usage of capital
investment. We intend to manage UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure to maintain our well invested asset base.
The members of our board of directors review all material UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure programs.

For a further description of UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure, see “—Key Factors Affecting Comparability
_of Our Results of Operations—UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure.”_

Over the next several years, we expect that UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure will be largely success and
capacity based. Success and capacity based UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure includes UG Adjusted Capital
Expenditure related to the expansion of our network footprint to additional homes and existing subscribers,
the replacement of set-top boxes, expanding network capacity, new product and service development and
expenditure incurred when connecting business subscribers to our network. Success based UG Adjusted
Capital Expenditure does not include UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure for maintenance, upgrade and
replacement of our systems and infrastructure.

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure amounted to €91 million,
compared to €58 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and included mainly investments in


-----

network expansion, customer premise equipment, as well as the purchase of new programming rights and
investments in mobile infrastructure.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, certain of our primary UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure items
included: investments of €40.4 million on customer premise equipment; an investment of €49.9 million on the
buildup of our fixed network; investments of €61.7 million on development of media, including acquisition
of content and investment in TV equipment; investments of €34.9 million on our mobile infrastructure; an
investment of €10.7 million on our IT; investments of €15.9 million on IP equipment; investments of
€6.4 million on Video HE equipment; an investment of €7.7 million on certain development costs, including
€4.5 million with respect to United.Cloud; and an estimated €41.0 million for the integration of Vivacom;
investments of €42.6 million on other capital expenditures, of which acquisition costs represent €21.1 million.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, certain of our primary UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure items
included: investments of €41.6 million on customer premise equipment; an investment of €40.8 million on the
buildup of our fixed network; investments of €44.1 million on development of media, including acquisition
of content and investment in TV equipment; investments of €14.3 million on our mobile infrastructure;
investments of €12.0 million on customer acquisition; an investment of €3.7 million on our IT; and an
investment of €4.5 million on certain development costs, including with respect to United.Cloud.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, certain of our primary UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure items
included: investments of €37 million in customer premises equipment; an investment of €42.9 million in the
buildup of our network; investments of €10 million in mobile infrastructure; and an investment of €3 million
in United.Cloud. Out of our UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure for the year ended December 31, 2018,
€5.5 million represented certain investments (€3.5 million for a digitalization project in the city of Belgrade in
Serbia and €2.0 million for the modernization of acquired companies’ networks in Bosnia and Herzegovina).

For the year ending December 31, 2021, we expect one-off investments to total €133.4 million and include:
(i) €8.9 million primarily for upgrades of our fixed fiber networks and data centers and other development
projects, including a 1 Ghz/85 Mhz capacity expansion project of the HFC plant and an HFC network
upgrade in Slovenia, Bosnia and Serbia; (ii) €93.8 million for the acquisition of 4G and 5G mobile frequencies;
(iii) €14.1 million in total for the integration of acquired companies in Croatia (€8.7 million), Bulgaria
(€2.7 million) and Slovenia (€2.5 million); (iv) €9.3 million for a national VPN project in Greece (Syzefxis II);
and (v) €7.4 million related to transition service agreements and the rebranding of our operations in Croatia
and Bulgaria. We do not currently expect core capital expenditure to exceed depreciation and amortization
levels on a long-term basis.

For the year ending December 31, 2021, we estimate that our capital expenditure (excluding any amounts for
Forthnet (estimated at €112.6 million), Nova BG (estimated at €6.5 million) or mobile frequencies (estimated
at €93.8 million)) will be between approximately €371 million and €373 million, which we expect will include:

- an estimated €50.2 million on customer premise equipment (€40.4 million in 2020);

- an estimated €73.6 million on our fixed network (€49.9 million in 2020);

- an estimated €66.0 million on our mobile network (€34.9 million in 2020);

- an estimated €12.9 million on IT (€10.7 million in 2020);

- an estimated €18.9 million on IP equipment (€15.9 million in 2020);

- an estimated €6.6 million on Video HE equipment (an estimated €6.4 million in 2020)

- an estimated €6.7 million on development costs, including with respect to United.Cloud (€7.7 million in
2020);

- an estimated €66.2 million on development of media, including acquisition of content and investment in
TV equipment (€61.7 million in 2020); and

- an estimated €70.6 million on other capital expenditures (€42.6 million in 2020).

These estimates are budgeted amounts and may differ from our actual capital expenditure as our business
requirements change.

**_UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure by Segment_**

In this management’s discussion and analysis, for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and the
three months ended March 31, 2020 and the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, we have derived

IFRS 16), from €53,070 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was mainly due to
lower mobile network investments as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.

_Serbia Group segment._ UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure for our Serbia Group segment decreased by
€11,587 thousand, or 18%, to €54,068 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020 (excluding the impact
of IFRS 16), from €65,655 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due
to lower investments in customer-premises equipment, video head-end and IP equipment as well as fixed
network installation and material investments compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.

_Bosnia Group segment._ UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure for our Bosnia Group segment increased by
€1,526 thousand, or 11%, to €15,702 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020 (excluding the impact of


-----

IFRS 16), from €14,176 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to
higher investments in customer premises equipment and higher capitalized inventories compared to the year
ended December 31, 2019.

_Montenegro Group segment._ UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure for our Montenegro Group segment
decreased by €885 thousand, or 22%, to €3,107 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020 (excluding the
impact of IFRS 16), from €3,992 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily
due to lower fixed network investments and customer-premises equipment, which offset the higher level of
capitalized inventories and an increase in the number of installations resulting from a larger number of new
subscribers added as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.

_Croatia Group segment._ UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure for our Croatia Group segment was
€25,916 thousand in the year ended December 31, 2020 (excluding the impact of IFRS 16) and represents UG

investments in new production capacity and higher R&D investments, particularly for United Cloud.

**_Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018_**

_Slovenia Group segment._ UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure for our Slovenia Group segment decreased by
€4,164 thousand, or 7%, to €53,070 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €57,234 thousand
for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was due to the one-time purchase of a new building in
Ljubljana and a cable network upgrade during the year ended December 31, 2018.

_Serbia Group segment._ UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure for our Serbia Group segment increased by
€4,465 thousand, or 7%, to €65,655 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €61,190 thousand
for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to higher customer premises equipment
and network investments compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.

_Bosnia Group segment._ UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure for our Bosnia Group segment decreased by
€752 thousand, or 5%, to €14,176 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €14,928 thousand for
the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to lower customer premises equipment
and IP equipment compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.

_Montenegro Group segment._ UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure for our Montenegro Group segment
decreased by €1,182 thousand, or 23%, to €3,992 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, from
€5,174 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to decreased
capitalized inventories compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.

_Media Group segment._ UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure for our Media Group segment increased by
€5,054 thousand, or 11%, to €49,413 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019 from €44,359 thousand
for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to investments in the production of
new exclusive content for certain of our channels, the effect of acquisitions and the increased cost of sports
rights.

**Off Balance Sheet Arrangements**

As of March 31, 2021, we have issued certain guarantees to third parties in the amount of €15,912 thousand.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk**

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

Our income and cash flow from operations are affected by changes in market interest rates. Some items on our
balance sheet, such as cash and bank balances, interest bearing investments and borrowings, are exposed to
interest rate risk.

Borrowings under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and the Existing Floating Rate Notes bear interest at
varying rates, and as a result we will have interest risk with respect to this debt. Interest rate hedging
arrangements are not in place as of the Issue Date with respect to the debt under our Existing Revolving


-----

Credit Facility or the Existing Floating Rate Notes. For fixed rate debt, interest rate changes affect the fair
market value of such debt, but do not impact earnings or cash flow.

**_Currency Risk_**

Currency risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognized assets or liabilities are denominated
in a currency that is not the functional currency of the Group entity holding the asset or obligation. As a
result of our operations in various countries, we generate a significant portion of our sales and incur a
significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than the euro. Our primary exposure is to the Serbian
dinar. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, 15% of our revenue was denominated in Serbian dinars.
The Bosnia and Herzegovinian mark is pegged to the euro, while the Croatian kuna and North Macedonian
dinar are relatively stable. In March 2015, we entered into a EUR/USD currency hedge agreement, pursuant
to which we hedge our exposure to the U.S. dollar. We entered into an additional EUR/USD currency hedge
agreement in May 2016 pursuant to which we hedged the remaining portion of our exposure to the U.S.
dollar for 2016. In February 2017, we entered into an additional EUR/USD currency hedge, which hedged
most of our 2017 U.S. dollar exposure. Based on our lack of any material change in exposure to the U.S.
dollar in the three months ended March 31, 2021, we did not enter into any additional currency hedge
agreements during the three months ended March 31, 2021.

As the Bulgarian lev is pegged to the euro, we do not expect to hedge against exposure to the Bulgarian lev.

**_Translation Risk_**

Translation risk is the risk that the value in euro of the consolidated profit and loss statement and balance
sheet will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates connected with the translation of our subsidiaries
that do not have the euro as their functional currency. Since January 1, 2016, almost all our indebtedness has
been denominated in euros.

**_Transaction Risk_**

Transaction risk is the risk of exchange losses incurred by us through purchases and sales in currencies other
than the local currency of the relevant subsidiaries.

**Critical Accounting Policies**

For a description of our critical accounting estimates and judgments, see Note 6 to the 2020 Company Audited
Financial Statements, which are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. Our significant accounting
policies and changes of accounting policies, including IFRS 16 (Leases), are described in Notes 2 and 3 to the
2020 Company Audited Financial Statements and Notes 3 and 4 to the 2019 Company Audited Financial
Statements.

_Financial Condition and Results of Operations” is based on the historical financial data included in this offering_
_memorandum and should be read in conjunction with “Presentation of Financial Data,” “Summary of Company_
_and Group Run-Rate, Vivacom, Unaudited Pro Forma and Certain Other Financial Data,” “and the Vivacom_
_Audited Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. Prospective investors should read_
_the entire offering memorandum and not just rely on the information set out below. The following discussion of_
_Vivacom’s results of operations and financial condition contains forward-looking statements. Vivacom’s actual_
_results could differ materially from those that are discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that_
_could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this offering_
_memorandum, particularly under “Risk Factors” and “Forward-looking Statements.”_

**Vivacom’s Business Overview**

We acquired Vivacom in the Vivacom Acquisition on July 31, 2020. Since the completion of the Vivacom
Acquisition, Vivacom’s results have been consolidated with ours as part of our Bulgaria Group segment.

Vivacom is the market leading integrated telecommunications operator in Bulgaria (based on revenue for the
year ended December 31, 2020) offering both fixed and mobile telecommunications services, as well as
broadcasting and satellite services, with a market share of 30% in Bulgaria by revenue as of December 31,
2020, according to the CRC.

Vivacom provides mobile, broadband, fixed-telephony, and Pay-TV (both DTH and IPTV) services in
Bulgaria to residential and business customers. Vivacom is the leading operator of fixed-line telephony services
in Bulgaria (60% market share), the leading provider of broadband in Bulgaria (27% market share), the
number three provider of mobile-telephony services in Bulgaria (29% market share in the three player mobile
market) and the number three provider of Pay-TV in Bulgaria (26% market share), in each case, as of
December 31, 2020, based on the number of subscribers, according to the CRC. Vivacom has consistently
taken market share across most of its segments in recent years. Vivacom as of March 31, 2021, had
2,961 million mobile subscribers, 573 thousand fixed-line telephony subscribers, 464 thousand fixed
broadband subscribers and 489 thousand Pay-TV subscribers. Vivacom operates a well invested, fully owned
and integrated fiber backbone network and has an extensive fiber to the home / fiber to the business network
in Bulgaria. It also operates the fastest mobile network in Bulgaria, with an award-winning LTE network,
covering 99% of the population. The quality of Vivacom’s network, implementation of operational efficiencies
and consolidation of services under one brand have led to high customer satisfaction and decreasing churn
rates.

Bulgaria is a relatively large, economically stable and mostly urban nation of seven million people and three
million households. Bulgaria presents an attractive market, with rational and growing mobile markets, with a
high and growing share of the market consisting mostly of post-paid mobile subscriptions, with increasing
broadband penetration and migration to IPTV. Bulgaria presents a favorable business environment with
average real GDP growth of 3.3% each year between 2017 and 2019 (according to the BNSI), compared to the
euro area average of 1.9% during the same period, according to the IMF, a flat corporate income tax and low
public debt compared to the EU average. The Bulgarian lev is pegged to the euro.

Vivacom has historically been consistently profitable, with Vivacom Adjusted EBITDA having increased by a
CAGR of 9% between 2018 and 2020 and Vivacom Adjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as Vivacom
Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue) was 45% for the year ended December 31, 2020, and cash generative,
with an attractive adjusted capital expenditure and adjusted operating free cash flow profile, with Vivacom
Operating Free Cash Flow having increased by a CAGR of 24% between 2018 and 2020.

**Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations**

**_Services_**

Vivacom generates most of its revenue from the provision of mobile services and fixed-line voice telephony
and data services (including Pay-TV). Vivacom also provides TV and radio broadcasting services through its
NURTS business segment. Vivacom believes that its ability to provide nationwide bundled offerings (“dual
play, “triple play” or “quadruple play”) provides an important competitive advantage.

_Mobile_

Vivacom’s mobile segment comprises its mobile services, both voice and data, and its other mobile business,
which includes among other things, the sale of mobile handsets. Vivacom’s mobile revenue is principally
driven by its average number of subscribers and ARPU. For the year ended December 31, 2020, revenue
generated by Vivacom’s mobile segment comprised 63% of its total revenue.

The Bulgarian mobile market is characterized by high penetration rates and high levels of competition. As a
result, Vivacom’s mobile subscriber base depends on a number of factors, including pricing, quality of service,
availability of new services, overall market growth, the level of competition to obtain new subscribers,
retaining existing subscribers, its ability to cause existing subscribers to use their Vivacom SIM card as their
primary SIM card (rather than as an alternate SIM card) and general economic conditions in Bulgaria. As a
result of more customer favorable tariffs, including minutes to other operators and high data consumption
limits, Vivacom believes that mobile subscribers will gradually cease using multiple SIM cards but rather
choose one mobile operator.

Mobile services ARPU is driven primarily by recurring charges from post-paid subscribers, traffic volume,
data services utilization, revenue from interconnection rates and its prices. Vivacom’s prices, in turn, are mainly
driven by the level of competition and the increasing demand for mobile data. Ultimately, Vivacom
management believes that the increasing demand for mobile data is leading to increasing ARPU due to the
higher contributions from data ARPU.

_Fixed-line_

Vivacom’s fixed-line segment comprises its fixed voice services, fixed data services, fixed Pay-TV services and
other fixed business, which includes its wholesale duct rental business. For the year ended December 31, 2020,
revenue generated by Vivacom’s fixed-line segment comprised 36% of its total revenue.

Fixed-Voice: Fixed-telephony and Other

Vivacom’s fixed voice services include fixed-telephony and other fixed voice services. For the year ended
December 31, 2020, revenues generated by Vivacom’s fixed voice services comprised 7% of its total revenue.

Fixed-telephony subscriber levels depend on a number of factors, including pricing, the availability of new
services and technologies, Vivacom’s ability to retain existing subscribers and win subscribers from
competitors as well as general economic conditions in Bulgaria. Vivacom’s fixed-telephony subscriber numbers
are gradually declining due to fixed-to-mobile substitution by customers and mobile operators’ fixedtelephony offerings, which undercut its prices and attract price sensitive customers.

Wholesale traffic consists primarily of international transit traffic passing through Vivacom’s network to
other national or international operators. Vivacom’s wholesale traffic business has low margins and is
susceptible to volume volatility depending on the transit prices it sets, which transit prices change based on its
wholesale interconnect expenses.


-----

Fixed-Data: Fixed Broadband and Other

Fixed data revenue, which includes revenue from fixed broadband and other data services is principally
affected by the average number of subscribers and ARPU, which in turn depend on Vivacom’s prices and the
speed and quality of connections that it is able to provide to its customers. For the year ended December 31,
2020, revenue generated by Vivacom’s fixed data services comprised 9% of its total revenue.

Vivacom’s fixed data services comprises its fixed broadband services provided over ADSL, VDSL and FTTx
connections to both residential and business customers and other data services, which include complex IP
based data solutions for large business customers (including VPN and MAN services) as well as its “legacy”
leased lines services that are mainly used by its security conscious business customers, such as financial
institutions, who are looking for dedicated data capacity. If the enforcement of regulations against “grey
market” operators increases as expected, the penetration rate of fixed data services is likely to grow.
Additionally, subscribers are seeking higher broadband speeds and better connection quality, which are priced
at a premium.

Revenue from other fixed data services is generated from Vivacom’s professional internet, IP VPN and MAN
services and complex corporate data solutions offered to business customers, as well as the sale of CPEs. The
provision of additional services, nationwide offerings and quality backed service level agreements contribute
to Vivacom’s ARPU.

Fixed pay-TV

Vivacom launched its DTH television service in 2010 and IPTV service in 2012, and is currently positioned as
a fully integrated “quadruple play”operator offering nationwide coverage in Bulgaria. Vivacom’s DTH service
delivers television content directly to its customers’ homes via satellite while its IPTV service is a fully
digitalized platform delivering television content via Internet connectivity, which provides a variety of
television channels, video on demand and a range of interactive features, including its over-the-top TV
solution, TV GO.

Vivacom’s Pay-TV revenue is principally driven by the number of subscribers and the services that they select.
Vivacom offers a variety of services through both DTH and IPTV, including packages with over 240 channels
that include more than 75 HD channels, exclusive content and other interactive services on its IPTV platform.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, revenue generated by Vivacom’s fixed Pay-TV services comprised 10%
of its total revenue.

Fixed-Other

Vivacom’s other fixed businesses are comprised of various services. For the year ended December 31, 2020,
revenues generated by Vivacom’s other fixed business accounted for 11% of its total revenue. These include
wholesale services to other licensed telecommunications operations, such as duct rental and collocation of
equipment. Various digital and cloud services, including cloud IaaS, managed cloud VPS, shared web and
e-mail hosting, SSL certificates, collocation, fleet management platform and others are also offered to business
customers. Vivacom’s specific projects under the “VIVA Smart” brand, including smart city, Internet of
Things (“IoT”), video surveillance, electronic education and other innovative solutions are also areas of
potential expansion.

**_Termination Rates_**

Vivacom generates revenue from access and interconnection fees received from other network operators for
calls terminated on its network, and it is required to pay access and interconnection fees to other network
operators for calls terminated on their networks, in each case both domestic and international. These access
and interconnection fees are based on set termination rates for both fixed-line calls (“FTRs”) and mobile
calls, which affect both mobile and fixed-telephony revenues and costs. Termination rates are regulated by the
Communications Regulation Commission (“CRC”) in Bulgaria.

**_General Economic Conditions in Bulgaria_**

Many European countries have faced or are facing an economic slowdown or low rates of GDP growth,
including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may include a general contraction in consumer
spending resulting from, among other factors, reduced consumer confidence, falling gross domestic product,
declining populations, rising or stagnating unemployment rates and uncertainty in the macroeconomic
environment. Although the general economic climate in Bulgaria has also seen negative effects, the Bulgarian


-----

economy has historically demonstrated economic growth and fiscal stability with low levels of government
debt. According to the BNSI, Bulgaria’s real GDP grew at an average rate of 3.3% each year between 2017
and 2019.

Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 13, 2020 the Bulgarian parliament declared a
state of emergency in Bulgaria and on March 23, 2020, it adopted certain measures and actions aimed at
mitigating the negative consequences of the pandemic on citizens and businesses. Subsequently, similar
extraordinary measures were introduced, some of which are still in effect since May 14, 2020. The Bulgarian
Minister of Healthcare and the Bulgarian parliament adopted several social distancing and other restrictive
measures, particularly with respect to access to restaurants, shopping centers and other commercial facilities,
aimed at managing the spread of the pandemic, which have had a material adverse impact on the overall
economy of Bulgaria. As of the date of this offering memorandum, even though the most restrictive social
distancing measures were lifted and the Bulgarian government has implemented economic recovery measures
while new infections have decreased, certain restrictions and social distancing measures remain in place, and
additional restrictions could be reinstated at any time and at different levels as new variants of the virus
spread. Such existing and potential measures may continue to adversely affect the overall economy of Bulgaria
and could have a material adverse impact on Vivacom’s results of operations, in particular on its ARPUs and
roaming revenues. However, these effects have been partially offset by the decrease in interconnect and roaming
expenses. A potential prolonged recession and a deepening economic crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic
could impact Vivacom’s growth prospects, customer spending and collection, and may result in assumptions
and estimates that could trigger material adjustments to the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the
future.

Vivacom operates in the telecommunications sector, for which underlying customer demand has in the past
been less cyclical than a number of other areas of consumer spending. However, the general macroeconomic
environment could still have an adverse effect on consumer spending. In poor economic conditions, consumers
are likely to delay the replacement of their existing mobile phones or may be more likely to disconnect or
cancel their services. Generally, weak economic conditions may weigh on the growth prospects of the
telecommunications market in Bulgaria, which in turn may negatively impact Vivacom’s number of
subscribers and ARPU.

**_Competition_**

Vivacom faces competition from the two other major Bulgarian mobile network operators, A1 Bulgaria and
Telenor Bulgaria, each of which holds a greater share of the mobile market than does Vivacom. Vivacom’s
mobile service revenue market share was approximately 29% as of December 31, 2020 according to the CRC.
Vivacom is the market leader in the fixed broadband market, with a 27% subscriber market share as of
December 31, 2020, followed by A1 Bulgaria and Bulsatcom, according to the CRC. In the Bulgarian fixed
broadband market, Vivacom competes primarily with A1 Bulgaria, Telenor Bulgaria, Bulsatcom and a
significant number of small-scale regional operators. Many of the small-scale operators are considered to
operate in the “grey market”as they do not pay taxes or license fees and use illegal aerial cables to deliver their
fixed broadband services, which gives them an anticompetitive advantage, as they are able to offer lower
priced fixed broadband products. If the enforcement of regulations against “grey market”operators increases,
as Vivacom management expects, its penetration rate is expected to increase.

Vivacom’s primary competitors have pursued aggressive marketing and pricing strategies to retain and expand
their respective market shares which, if further pursued in the future, could reduce Vivacom’s margins, cause
Vivacom to increase its marketing and promotional expenses in response to such strategies and result in
increased customer churn. In addition, the competitive nature of the market in which Vivacom operates may
be exacerbated by new market entrants or the consolidation of some of its primary competitors. Vivacom
tries to avoid direct price competition and believes that its revenues and profitability will be supported by
continued growth in the number of its subscribers, cross-selling and up selling of services, the launch of
innovative new services and the active management of its subscriber acquisition, maintenance and retention
costs.

Source: Bulgarian Communications Regulatory Agency; Vivacom’s estimates for penetration rate in the year ended December 31, 2020.

(1) Based on the number of SIM cards in use and does not include subscribers of MVNOs.

Vivacom’s mobile subscriber base consists primarily of residential subscribers and, in line with the Bulgarian
mobile telecommunications market, the vast majority of its subscribers are post-paid subscribers. As of
December 31, 2020, 88% of Vivacom’s total mobile subscriber base consisted of post-paid subscribers. All of
Vivacom’s business subscribers are post-paid subscribers.

Vivacom’s mobile subscriber base has decreased from 2,985 thousand subscribers as of December 31, 2019 to
2,954 thousand subscribers as of December 31, 2020. The decrease was mainly attributable to the post-paid
subscriber base as a result of the ongoing SIM card consolidation trend in the mobile market.

Blended mobile ARPU increased by 8% to BGN 13.5 for the year ended December 31, 2020, from BGN 12.5
for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to increased data usage as a result of growing demand
for data.

Blended mobile ARPU increased by 9% to BGN 12.5 for the year ended December 31, 2019, from BGN 11.4
for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to an increase in data usage as a result of growing
smartphone penetration and strong demand for data.

According to the CRC, the total number of subscribers in Bulgaria has declined by a CAGR of 2% between
December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2019, to 8.1 million subscribers, corresponding to a mobile penetration
rate of 117% as of December 31, 2019. This decrease is mainly as a result of the ongoing SIM card
consolidation trend in the mobile market.

Fixed-telephony

Vivacom’s total fixed-telephony subscribers decreased by 12% to 524 thousand as of December 31, 2020,
from 593 thousand as of December 31, 2019. The decrease in fixed-telephony subscribers was primarily due
to the strong price competition surrounding fixed-telephony services, where such services are being offered at
a low price addition to Vivacom’s competitors’ mobile, fixed broadband and Pay-TV services.

Vivacom’s total fixed-telephony subscribers decreased by 14% to 593 thousand as of December 31, 2019,
from 689 thousand as of December 31, 2018. Both decreases in fixed-telephony subscribers were primarily
due to strong price competition for fixed-telephony services, where such services are being offered as a low
price addition to Vivacom’s competitors’ mobile, fixed broadband and Pay-TV services.

Total fixed-telephony ARPU increased by 1% to BGN 10.2 for the year ended December 31, 2020, from
BGN 10.1 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in total fixed-telephony ARPU was primarily
due to increased take-up of more generous tariffs with higher monthly recurring charges.

Total fixed-telephony ARPU increased by 2% to BGN 10.1 for the year ended December 31, 2019, from
BGN 9.9 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in total fixed-telephony ARPU was primarily
due to the introduction of more generous tariffs with included minutes by destinations.

Fixed Broadband

Vivacom’s fixed broadband subscribers increased by 3% to 475 thousand as of December 31, 2020, from
459 thousand as of December 31, 2019. This increase was mainly due to higher FTTx connections driven by
growing demand for high-speed bandwidth capacity and reliable broadband service.

Vivacom’s total fixed broadband subscribers increased by 3% to 459 thousand as of December 31, 2019, from
444 thousand as at December 31, 2018. This increase was mainly due to higher FTTx connections driven by
growing demand for high-speed bandwidth capacity and reliable broadband service.

Vivacom’s fixed broadband ARPU decreased by 0.1% to BGN 10.1 for the year ended December 31, 2020,
from BGN 10.2 for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to bundling discounts
and price competition from other alternative operators, which were partially offset by a growing share of
tariffs with high bandwidth capacity.

Vivacom’s total fixed broadband ARPU increased by 7% to BGN 10.2 for the year ended December 31, 2019,
from BGN 9.5 for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to a growing share of
tariffs with high bandwidth capacity, despite bundling discounts and price competition from alternative
operators.

Fixed Pay-TV

Vivacom’s total fixed Pay-TV subscribers increased by 5% to 516 thousand as of December 31, 2020, from
490 thousand as of December 31, 2019. This increase was mainly due to the increased demand for high-quality
services with superior user experience, rich content and HD channels.

Vivacom’s total fixed Pay-TV subscribers also increased 5% to 490 thousand as of December 31, 2019, from
468 thousand as of December 31, 2018. This increase was mainly due to the increased demand for high-quality
services with superior user experience, rich content and HD channels.

Vivacom’s total fixed Pay-TV ARPU increased by 5% to BGN 17.5 for the year ended December 31, 2020,
from BGN 16.7 for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was mainly attributable to the growing
share of tariffs with higher monthly recurring fees and additional packages with rich content and sports
channels.

Vivacom’s total fixed Pay-TV ARPU also increased by 10% to BGN 16.7 for the year ended December 31,
2019, from BGN 15.2 for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was mainly attributable to the
growing share of tariffs with higher monthly recurring fees and additional packages with rich content.

**_Implementation of Accounting Policies_**

_IFRS 16 Leases_

Under IFRS 16, a lessee is required to recognize assets and liabilities for principally all leases on its balance
sheet. Vivacom adopted the new standard on January 1, 2019 but has not restated comparatives for the 2018


-----

reporting period. The reclassifications and the adjustments arising from the new leasing rules are recognized
on Vivacom’s opening balance sheet on January 1, 2019. On transition to IFRS 16, Vivacom recognized an
additional BGN 258,676 thousand of right-of-use assets and BGN 259,403 thousand of lease liabilities.

**Explanation of Key Income Statement Items**

**_Revenue_**

Vivacom’s revenue recognition policy comprises all revenues from the ordinary business activities, including
not only revenues generated by core businesses, but also other recurring sales of goods or rendering of services,
and income from contractual penalties and default interest. Revenues are recognized net of value added tax in
accordance with the provision of goods or services. Gains from sales of property, plant and equipment,
investment property or intangible assets are not classified as revenue but presented in other gains and losses,
net.

Following the mandatory implementation of IFRS 15 effective as of January 1, 2018, Vivacom presents its
revenues in three main categories.

_Services Revenue_

Services revenue is generated from principal activities including provision of mobile and fixed voice and data
services, broadband internet access, Pay-TV services (DTH and IPTV), rent of terrestrial network (ducts), TV
and radio broadcasting, collocation services, connection and roaming fees billed to other operators. Services
revenue is recognized upon rendering of the agreed service. Services are usually billed and paid for on a
monthly basis. For service contracts with a continuous service provision, the contractually agreed total
consideration is recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the minimum contract term, regardless of
the payment pattern.

_Equipment Revenue_

Equipment revenue comprises the sale or lease of mobile handsets, other telecommunications equipment, and
accessories. Revenue associated with the sale of telecommunications equipment and accessories are recognized
when the products are delivered, provided there are no unfulfilled obligations that affect the customer’s final
acceptance of the arrangement. For telecommunications equipment sold separately, customers pay in full at
the point of sale. For devices sold or lease in combination with a term service contract, customers usually pay
monthly in equal instalments over a period of 12 or 24 months.

_Other Revenue_

Other revenue primarily includes penalties, revenues from marketing activities and revenues from assigned
overdue customer receivables, commission fees and rental income.

**_Interconnect Expenses_**

Interconnect expenses relate to the costs incurred when Vivacom’s customers’ calls are terminated on another
operator’s network or when its customers use the mobile network of other operators when roaming.

**_Other Operating Expenses_**

Other operating expenses include maintenance and repair costs for network and information systems, the
charged provisions for impairment of assets, costs of advertising, facilities and license fees and administrative
and professional costs amongst others. Prior to the financial period beginning January 1, 2012, Vivacom
recorded costs of value added services as other operating expenses, whereas subsequently revenue from value
added services has been recorded net of costs. With effect from January 1, 2019, the amount of recognized
losses for impairment of financial and contract assets is included under the separate line item “Net impairment
losses on financial and contract assets.”

**_Net Impairment Losses on Financial and Contract Assets_**

Net impairment losses on financial and contract assets include the amount of recognized losses resulting
from the impairment of financial and contract assets, which were previously included under “Other operating
_expenses” prior to the financial period beginning January 1, 2019._


-----

**_Materials and Consumables Expenses_**

Materials and consumables expenses are comprised of the costs of the materials consumed by Vivacom’s
business during the respective period, including the costs associated with mobile handsets sold and CPEs sold
and leased as well as electricity expenses.

**_Staff Costs_**

Staff costs include salaries, wages and bonuses, and pension, health and unemployment fund contributions.

**_Depreciation and Amortization_**

Vivacom’s tangible and intangible assets are depreciated and amortized on a straight-line basis over the best
estimate of their useful lives.

**_Finance Income and Costs_**

Finance income and costs include interest income on bank deposits and finance leases and interest expense on
borrowings and foreign exchange gain and loss.

**_Other Gains and Losses, Net_**

Other gains and losses, net comprises the result from sales of non-current assets and materials which are not
sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business, such as the decommissioning of cables and
disposals of real estate assets.

**_Income Tax Expenses_**

Income tax expenses include current and deferred taxes.

(2) The 2019 figures in the table above are derived from the unaudited comparative information included in the Vivacom Audited
Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2020. See “Presentation of Financial Data.” The restatement is due to a
change in accounting policy during 2020 related to leases of software aiming to align to the treatment and presentation of the

Group. See Note 2.1.1 to the 2020 Vivacom Audited Financial Statements. The figures for the year ended December 31, 2018
included in the table above were not restated to reflect this change in accounting policy given IFRS 16 was adopted as of January 1,
2019 under the modified retrospective approach, and therefore they may not be comparable with the figures for the years ended
December 31, 2019 and 2020 presented therein.

**_Year Ended December 31, 2020 as Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019_**

Vivacom’s fixed-line revenue, which is comprised of fixed voice (fixed-telephony and other), fixed data (fixed
broadband and other), fixed Pay-TV (IPTV and DTH) and other fixed-line services was BGN 356.6 million
for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of BGN 5.2 million, or 1.5%, from BGN 351.4 million for
the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was mainly attributable to the increase in fixed Pay-TV
revenues due to a growing share of tariffs with higher monthly recurring fees and additional packages with
rich content and sports channels, which was partially offset by strong price competition in fixed-telephony
and bundling discounts and price competition from other alternative operators in fixed data.

Vivacom’s mobile revenue was BGN 650.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of
BGN 24.2 million, or 4%, from BGN 626.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in
mobile revenue was mainly attributable to higher revenue from mobile data and a growing share of tariffs
with higher monthly recurring fees as a result of our smart “more for more” offerings and the quality of our
mobile network.

Vivacom’s NURTS revenue was BGN 36.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, An increase of
BGN 0.7 million, or 1% from BGN 36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, mainly attributable to

to higher mobile outbound traffic to other national mobile operators.

Vivacom’s materials and consumables expenses were BGN 178.8 million for the year ended December 31,
2020, an increase of BGN 11.9 million, or 7%, from BGN 166.9 million for the year ended December 31,

of BGN 1.7 million, or 1%, from BGN 169.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to
lower other net expenses, professional fees, facilities expenses, license fee expenses and maintenance and repairs
expenses, partially offset by higher advertising, customer service, billing and collection and administrative
expenses, leased lines and data transmission expenses and vehicles and transports expenses. Higher
advertising, customer service and billing and collection expenses was driven by higher content costs for
television rights. Administrative expenses increased mainly as a result of non-recurring payments for


-----

costs for international internet access and peering.

_Net impairment losses on financial and contract assets_

December 31, 2020, a decrease of BGN 1.8 million, or 18%, from BGN 9.6 million for the year ended

These transitional effects have reflected facilities expenses, vehicles and transports expenses, leased lines and
data transmission expenses and advertising, customer service, billing and collection expenses. The effect on
facilities expenses was mainly due to rental of commercial properties, technical premises and offices. The
effect on vehicles and transport expenses consisted of fleet lease charges. The impact on leased lines and data
transmission was due to rented capacity for satellite transmission used for broadcasting services. The effect on
advertising, customer service, billing and collection expenses was mainly related to satellite capacity charges
for the DTH-TV platform.

_Staff Costs_

Vivacom’s staff costs were BGN 138.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of
BGN 5.9 million, or 4%, from BGN 132.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, mainly resulting
from an increase in average salaries.

_Depreciation and Amortization_

Vivacom’s depreciation and amortization costs were BGN 244.6 million for the year ended December 31,
2019, an increase of BGN 46.0 million, or 23%, from BGN 198.6 million for the year ended December 31,
2018. This increase was mainly due to transitional effects related to the implementation of IFRS 16 and
subsequent recognition of right-of-use assets. Depreciation of right-of-use assets amounted to BGN
46.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

_Finance Costs_

Vivacom’s finance costs were BGN 43.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of
BGN 2.1 million, or 5%, from BGN 40.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase related
primarily to the accounting treatment of leases following the adoption of IFRS 16, which was partially offset
by lower interest expenses under Vivacom’s €365 million senior facilities agreement.

_Finance Income_

Vivacom’s finance income was BGN 8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of
BGN 1.4 million, or 18%, from BGN 7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, mainly attributable to
higher interest income on granted loans and income from lease contracts.

_Other Gains, Net_

Other gains, net were BGN 4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of BGN 12.8 million,
or 73%, from BGN 17.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The higher amount for the year ended
December 31, 2018 was due to the one-off effect of a refund for a prepayment to Bulgarian tax authorities.

_Income Tax Expenses_

Income tax expense was BGN 15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of
BGN 7.3 million, from BGN 8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which was driven mainly by
a higher current income tax charge reflecting the higher net profit for the period and a lower deferred tax
charge.

(3) The 2019 figures in the table above are derived from the unaudited comparative information included in the Vivacom Audited
Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2020. See “Presentation of Financial Data.”

Vivacom Adjusted EBITDA was BGN 447.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of
BGN 87.4 million, or 24%, from BGN 359.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which was driven
mainly by better performance in the top line and higher profitability, backed by a rational cost structure. The
mandatory adoption of IFRS 16, which was effective as of January 1, 2019, positively impacted Vivacom
Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019 by BGN 54.5 million.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Vivacom’s liquidity requirements arise primarily from the need to fund capital expenditures for the expansion
and maintenance of its network operations, both in terms of quality of services and innovative technologies,
for working capital and to repay debt. Historically, Vivacom’s principal sources of liquidity have been cash
flows from operating activities, which include revenues generated by its mobile and fixed-line subscribers,
periodically as supplemented by borrowings under certain debt facilities.

Vivacom’s ability to generate cash from operations will depend on its future operating performance, which in
turn is dependent on various factors, including but not limited to those described under “—Key Factors
_Affecting Results of Operations,”many of which are beyond its control. If Vivacom’s cash flow from operating_
activities is lower than expected, or its capital expenditure requirements exceed its projections, Vivacom may
be required to seek additional financing, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at
all. On July 31, 2020, United Group Bulgaria EOOD granted a related party loan to Vivacom with a maturity
of ten years and bullet repayment at maturity. With the funds received under such related party loan, Vivacom
pre-paid all liabilities under a senior debt facility that was due in 2023. As a result, Vivacom reduced its
exposure to long-term third-party financings, which improved the ability to manage its liquidity requirements
going forward.

Vivacom believes that its operating cash flows and borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet requirements
and commitments for the foreseeable future. Vivacom’s actual financing requirements will depend on
numerous factors, including general economic conditions, the availability of credit from banks, other financial
institutions and capital markets, Vivacom’s liquidity situation, restrictions in the instruments governing its
debt, and its general financial performance, the future projects it could undertake and the impact that the
COVID-19 pandemic could have on any of such factors. In particular, any prolonged economic crisis or


-----

recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively impact customer spending and collections
and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on Vivacom’s liquidity position.

Vivacom maintains cash and cash equivalents to fund the day-to-day requirements of its business. Vivacom
holds cash primarily in Bulgarian levs and euros.

**_Cash Flow_**

The following table summarizes the principal components of Vivacom’s consolidated cash flows for the
periods presented.

(1) The financial information for the year ended December 31, 2018 has not been restated for the adoption of IFRS 16, which was
adopted on January 1, 2019.

(2) The 2019 figures in the table above are derived from the unaudited comparative information included in the Vivacom Audited
Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2020. See “Presentation of Financial Data.” The restatement is due to a
change in accounting policy during 2020 related to leases of software aiming to align to the treatment and presentation of the
Group. See Note 2.1.1 to the 2020 Vivacom Audited Financial Statements. The figures for the year ended December 31, 2018
included in the table above were not restated to reflect this change in accounting policy given IFRS 16 was adopted as of January 1,
2019 under the modified retrospective approach, and therefore they may not be comparable with the figures for the years ended
December 31, 2019 and 2020 presented therein.

_Net Cash from Operating Activities_

For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash flows from operating activities decreased by BGN 6.0 million
to BGN 395.3 million, compared to BGN 401.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, mainly as a
result of lower profit before tax for the period, partially offset by favorable working capital dynamics.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash flows from operating activities increased by
BGN 120.7 million to BGN 401.3 million, compared to BGN 280.6 million for the year ended December 31,
2018, mainly as a result of better operating performance and optimization in inventories. As a result of the
adoption of IFRS 16, a significant portion of the lease payments recognized previously as cash flows from
operating activities in the statement of cash flows was reclassified as cash flows from financing activities
under the line item “Payment of lease liabilities.”

_Net Cash used in Investing Activities_

For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash flows used in investing activities decreased by
BGN 47.0 million to BGN 145.4 million, from BGN 192.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019,
mainly due to timing variances in the payment pattern of Vivacom’s capital expenditure program.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash flows used in investing activities decreased by
BGN 199.1 million to BGN 192.4 million, from BGN 391.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018,
mainly due to a lower amount of loans granted to related parties, partially offset by higher acquisitions of
property, plant, equipment and intangible assets in line with Vivacom’s capital expenditure investment
program but with timing variances in payments pattern.

_Net Cash used in Financing Activities_

For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash flows used in financing activities increased by
BGN 99.5 million to BGN 264.9 million, from BGN 165.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019
main e to dividends paid and higher payments of lease liabilities, partially offset by lower usage of borrowings.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash flows used in financing activities increased by
BGN 137.6 million to BGN 165.4 million, from BGN 27.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018


-----

mainly due to the reclassification of a significant portion of lease liabilities as cash flows from operating
activities following the adoption of IFRS 16.

**_Capital Expenditures and Investments_**

Vivacom’s investments mainly relate to the build out and enhancement of its fixed (particularly in respect of
FTTx and VDSL roll out) and mobile network as well as deployment of fixed and mobile network backup
solutions and spectrum acquisition. Vivacom’s capital expenditures also include information technology
investments aimed at supporting network development, commercial products and services and overall
customer management, as well as commercial and other capital expenditures for structural support to the
build out and maintenance of consumer points of sale (such as refurbishing and furniture) and for customer
equipment such as set-top boxes and optical network terminals. Vivacom’s capital expenditure plans are
subject to change depending on, among other things, the evolution of market conditions and the cost and
availability of funds.

The following table shows Vivacom’s historical capital expenditures for the periods indicated.

(1) With effect from January 1, 2020, Vivacom no longer reports NURTS (comprising its wholly-owned subsidiaries NURTS Bulgaria
EAD and NURTS Digital EAD) as a separate capital expenditure category and the relevant amounts are included under the other
respective categories (mainly network). As a result, capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2019 were reclassified to
remove NURTS as a separate capital expenditure category in line with the change effective from January 1, 2020.

(2) The figures for the year ended December 31, 2018 included in the table above were not restated to reflect the adoption of IFRS 16,
which was adopted as of January 1, 2019 under the modified retrospective approach, and therefore they may not be comparable
with the figures for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 presented therein.

For the year months ended December 31, 2020, capital expenditures amounted to BGN 199.8 million, which
consisted of:

- BGN 98.4 million of capital expenditures relating to network activities, mainly for investment in our mobile
radio access network, mobile core and transmission network, fixed core network, TV platform and FTTx
roll-out projects;

- BGN 27.4 million of capital expenditures relating to IT activities, primarily related to IT infrastructure
acquisitions and business support systems;

- BGN 45.3 million of capital expenditures relating to commercial and other activities, mainly for CPEs to
support Vivacom’s growing Pay-TV, fiber and fixed wireless subscriber base, as well as capitalized contract
acquisitions and contract fulfillment costs;

- BGN 0.1 million relating to Vivacom’s network infrastructure license fees;

- BGN 28.6 million rights of use relating to the acquisition of rental rights and leases treated under IFRS 16.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, capital expenditures amounted to BGN 205.3 million, which consisted
of:

- BGN 119.4 million of capital expenditures relating to network activities, mainly for investment in Vivacom’s
mobile radio access network, mobile core and transmission network, fixed core network, TV platform and
FTTx and VDSL roll out projects;

- BGN 22.0 million of capital expenditures relating to IT activities, primarily related to business support
systems and IT infrastructure acquisitions;


-----

- BGN 46.1 million of capital expenditures relating to commercial and other activities, mainly for CPEs to
support Vivacom’s growing Pay-TV, fiber and fixed wireless subscriber base, as well as capitalized contract
acquisition and contract fulfilment costs;

- BGN 0.5 million relating to Vivacom’s network infrastructure license fees; and

- BGN 17.3 million right-of-use relating to acquisition of rights of use treated under IFRS 16.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, capital expenditures amounted to BGN 202.3 million (which includes
the impact of IFRS 15), which consisted of:

- BGN 129.7 million of capital expenditures relating to network activities, mainly for investment in Vivacom’s
mobile radio access network, mobile core and transmission network, fixed core network, TV platform and
FTTx and VDSL roll out projects;

- BGN 18.5 million of capital expenditures relating to IT activities, primarily related to IT infrastructure
acquisitions and business support systems;

- BGN 51.6 million of capital expenditures relating to commercial and other activities, mainly for CPEs to
support Vivacom’s growing Pay-TV and fiber subscriber base, as well as sales commissions related to
long-term contracts; and

- BGN 1.9 million of capital expenditures relating to maintenance of NURTS infrastructure.

In line with Vivacom’s historical strategy, the amounts it spends and the time at which expenditures are made
will depend upon a variety of factors including current and anticipated subscriber demands and Vivacom’s
own targets relating to a desired mix of subscriber base, which is determined by its evolving business plan.
Vivacom’s capital expenditure plans are also affected by and updated for changing general economic
conditions.

**Off Balance Sheet Arrangements**

As of December 31, 2020, Vivacom did not have any off balance sheet arrangements, as disclosed in the notes
to the Vivacom Unaudited Interim Financial Statements and summarized in “—Contractual Obligations.”

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk**

Vivacom is exposed to various market risks, including foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risk,
credit and liquidity risks associated with its underlying assets, liabilities, forecast transactions and firm
commitments.

Vivacom’s treasury department is responsible for managing exposure to market risks that arise in connection
with operations and financial activities, including foreign currency exchange rate, credit and liquidity risk
management. These risks are identified, measured and monitored through various control mechanisms so
that Vivacom can establish adequate prices for the services it provides, appropriately assess the market
circumstances related to its investments and maintain free liquid funds to prevent undue concentration of a
particular risk.

The following sections discuss Vivacom’s most significant exposures to market risk. The following discussions
do not address other risks that Vivacom faces in the normal course of business, including country, political,
regulatory and legal risks.

**_Foreign Exchange Rate Risk_**

Vivacom’s foreign exchange rate risk exposure mainly relates to its exposure to U.S. dollars, mainly from
committed purchases of certain network equipment, satellite capacity and content. Vivacom manages its
foreign currency exchange rate risk related to future supplies denominated in USD by hedging the exposure
through forward contracts. All forward contracts are entered into with credible counterparties.

When a significant exposure to foreign currency arises, Vivacom takes into account the following factors:

- future outlook on the volatility of financial market variables, which are modeled by Vivacom’s treasury
department and are in accordance with best practice analytical techniques and economic models;

- effect of the given foreign exchange exposure on Vivacom’s financial results; and

- the cost of foreign exposure hedging.


-----

**_Credit Risk_**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from Vivacom’s counterparties’ inability to repay or service debt
in accordance with the contractual terms. Credit risk includes both the direct risk of default and the risk of a
deterioration of creditworthiness, as well as concentration risks. Vivacom believes it has appropriate credit
policies, procedures and authorization guidelines in place to manage and monitor credit risk.

Vivacom’s credit risk is principally associated with trade and other receivables. Vivacom seeks to minimize
credit risk through the application of monthly subscription contracts, initial credit checks, credit limits and
credit monitoring procedures. Vivacom also seeks to minimize credit risk by obtaining cash deposits from its
retail customers and distributors where it perceives credit risk to exist.

Vivacom believes that its implementation of the foregoing procedures has led to experiencing a limited amount
of credit losses. Expenses for receivables written off are recognized in other operating expenses in the profit or
loss for a given period. For 2018, 2019 and 2020, BGN 174 thousand, BGN 195 thousand and
BGN 102 thousand, respectively, of receivables were written off. In addition, Vivacom’s allowance for
impairment of receivables in the statement of financial position as of December 31, 2018, December 31, 2019
and December 31, 2020 amounted to BGN 105,512 thousand, BGN 97,547 thousand and
BGN 40,864 thousand, respectively for all trade and other receivables not written off, including CCB.
Furthermore, as a general rule, Vivacom’s has no significant level of credit concentration related to accounts
receivable.

Credit risk relating to cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments, financial deposits and money
market funds arises from the risk that the counterparty becomes insolvent and accordingly is unable to return
the deposited funds or execute the obligations under the derivative transactions as a result of the insolvency.
To mitigate this risk, wherever possible Vivacom conducts transactions and deposit funds with investment
grade rated financial institutions and monitor and limit the concentration of its transactions with any single
party.

Additionally, due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, net impairment losses on financial and contract
assets increased as a result of delays in customer payments during the second quarter of 2020, resulting
respectively in higher expected credit losses rates and an increase in the allowance for impairment of trade and
lease receivables measured by applying the IFRS 9 simplified approach. However, on a full-year basis, in the
year ended December 31, 2020 both net impairment losses on financial and contract assets and the allowance
for impairment of trade and lease receivables decreased compared to 2019. We believe that during the first
quarter of 2021, Vivacom’s ability to collect receivables improved and as of March 31, 2021, it has returned to
close to pre-COVID-19 levels.

**_Liquidity Risk_**

Liquidity risk is the risk that Vivacom may have difficulty in obtaining funds in order to meet both its
day-to-day operating requirements and debt servicing obligations (interest and debt repayments). This arises
mostly in connection with the contractual maturity of Vivacom’s monetary assets and liabilities that result
from business activities and from the possibility that its trade debtors may not be able to settle their payment
obligations within the normal terms of trade.

Vivacom monitors its liquidity requirements and aims to mitigate liquidity risk through monitoring cash
flows, ensuring the availability of overdraft facilities and preparing daily liquidity reports. Short and medium
term cash flow forecasting is performed by its treasury department. These forecasts are monitored to ensure
Vivacom’s cash and liquidity requirements are sufficient to meet operational needs and to monitor compliance
with borrowing limits and debt covenants on its borrowing facilities.

Any prolonged economic crisis or recession due to the COVID-19 pandemic could have a significant impact
on Vivacom’s growth prospects. However, Vivacom continues to generate profits and sufficient cash from
operations, supporting its activities and contractual commitments.

**Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments**

**_COVID-19 (Coronavirus) pandemic_**

The rapid development of COVID-19 and its social and economic impact in Bulgaria and globally, may result
in assumptions and estimates requiring revisions which may lead to material adjustments to the carrying value
of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. Following a resurgence of COVID-19 infections in late


-----

2020, the government-imposed lockdown measures in November 2020. Infections decreased and certain
measures were lifted but most remained in force until the end of January 2021. Vivacom’s operations were not
restricted by the lockdown, and the impact on its financial position and performance remained in line with
the disclosure in the Vivacom Audited Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Any prolonged economic crisis or recession due to the COVID-19 pandemic could impact Vivacom’s growth
prospects, customer spending and collection, and may result in assumptions and estimates that could trigger
material adjustments to the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the future. In particular, management
expects the assumptions and estimates used in determining impairment of Trade and other receivables,
Contract assets, Property, plant and equipment, Intangible assets, Right-of-use assets and valuation of
Investment property, and the related Deferred tax assets and liabilities to be affected. Management is not able
to reliably estimate these impact as events are unfolding day by day. The COVID-19 pandemic had a negative
impact on Mobile services revenue due to lower roaming revenue, primarily as a result of the COVID-19
related travel restrictions. This was partially offset by a decrease in interconnection and roaming expenses.
Further impacts on service revenues are limited by the increased demand for telecom services during the
periods in which the COVID-19 related restrictions were implemented. The longer term impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic may also affect trading volumes, cash flows and profitability.

The COVID-19 pandemic did not have an impact on the other critical accounting estimates and judgements
disclosed in the Vivacom Audited Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2020.

The discussion and analysis of Vivacom’s results of operations and financial condition are based on the
Vivacom Audited Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 disclosed in Note 4
thereof, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. The preparation of these financial statements
requires management to apply accounting methods and policies that are based on difficult or subjective
judgments, estimates based on past experience and assumptions determined to be reasonable and realistic
based on the related circumstances. The application of these estimates and assumptions affects the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date
and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. The resulting accounting
estimates could differ from the related actual results. All assumptions, expectations and forecasts used as a
basis for certain estimates within the Vivacom Audited Financial Statements represent good faith assessments
of Vivacom’s future performance for which management believes there is a reasonable basis. Estimates and
judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

Detailed information regarding significant accounting policies is provided in Note 2 to the Vivacom Audited
Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 included elsewhere in this offering
memorandum.

**_Impairment of Goodwill, Tangible and Intangible Assets_**

In recent years, Vivacom has been conducting annual impairment testing of its assets, and no need for
impairment has been identified. Taking into account the fact that Vivacom has during this period performed
in line with its projections, and based on the assessment that no internal or external indicators exist that affect
the recoverable amount of assets or trigger the need for annual impairment testing of assets, Vivacom
considers that the carrying amount of assets as of December 31, 2019 did not exceed their recoverable amount.
Taking into account the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Vivacom has performed new
impairment testing of its assets as of December 31, 2020 and no need for impairment was identified. Based on
the analysis performed, there would be no need for impairment even in the event estimated cash flows were
10% lower.

**_Useful Lives of Assets_**

The determination of the useful lives of assets is based on historical experience with similar assets as well as
any anticipated technological development and changes in broad economic or industry factors. The
appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of assets is reviewed annually, or whenever there is an indication
of significant changes in the underlying assumptions. Vivacom believes that the accounting estimate related
to the determination of the useful lives of assets is a critical accounting estimate as it involves assumptions
about technological development in an innovative industry. Further, due to the significance of depreciable
assets as a percentage of Vivacom’s total assets, the impact of any changes in these assumptions could be
material to its financial position and results of operations.


-----

Were the actual useful lives of the assets to differ by 10% from management’s estimates as of December 31,
2020, the carrying value of the plant and equipment and respectively depreciation and amortization charges
would be an estimated BGN 17.2 million higher or lower.

**_Provisions, Decommissioning Costs and Contingent Liabilities_**

As set out in Note 28 of the Vivacom Audited Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2019
and and Note 29 of the Vivacom Audited Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2020,
Vivacom is a participant in several lawsuits and administrative proceedings. For more information, see “Our
_Business—Legal Proceedings.”Vivacom’s treatment of obligations with uncertain timing and amount depends_
on management’s estimation of the amount and timing of the obligation and probability of an outflow of
resources embodying economic benefits that will be required to settle the obligation (both legal and
constructive).

A provision is recognized when Vivacom has a present obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that
an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the
amount of the obligation. Contingent liabilities are not recognized because their existence will be confirmed
only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within Vivacom’s
control. Contingent liabilities are assessed continually to determine whether an outflow of resource embodying
economic benefits has become probable. If it becomes probable that an outflow of future economic benefits
will be required for an item previously dealt with as a contingent liability, a provision is recognized in the
financial statements of the period in which the change in probability occurs.

**_Going Concern_**

The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that Vivacom will
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. In the year ended December 31, 2020, Vivacom
realized a profit of BGN 123,265 thousand, compared to BGN 137,748 thousand in the year ended
December 31, 2019 Vivacom’s future viability depends upon the business environment as well as upon the
continuing support of its existing and potential owners and providers of finance. Vivacom’s directors, in light
of their assessment of expected future cash flows, are satisfied that it is appropriate for the financial statements
to be prepared on a going concern basis.

**_Revenue Recognition, Contract Assets and Liabilities_**

Multiple element arrangements involving the delivery or provision of multiple products or services are assessed
to determine whether it is necessary to separate the different identifiable components and apply the
corresponding revenue recognition policy to each element. The transaction price for the entire multiple
element arrangement is allocated among the identified elements based on their respective standalone selling
prices. Determining standalone selling prices for each identified element requires estimates that are complex
due to the nature of the business. A change in estimates of standalone selling prices could affect the allocation
of revenue among the elements and, as a result, the timing of recognition of revenues and the carrying amount
of contract assets and liabilities.

**_Allowance for Impairment of Trade and Other Receivables, Leases and Contract Assets_**

An allowance for impairment of trade and other receivables is established for estimated losses resulting from
the inability of customers to make their payments due. When evaluating the adequacy of an allowance for
doubtful accounts, management bases its estimates on the aging of accounts receivable balances and historical
write-off experience, customer creditworthiness and estimated probability of default. If the financial condition
of customers were to deteriorate, actual write-offs might be higher than expected.

**_Income Tax Provision_**

Vivacom is subject to income taxes in the Bulgarian tax jurisdiction. Significant judgment is required in
determining the provision for income taxes. Vivacom recognizes liabilities for anticipated tax due based on
management estimates. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were
initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in
which such determination is made.

**_Assignment of receivables on cash deposits_**

The transactions for assignment of receivables on cash deposits in Corporate Commercial Bank AD—in
bankruptcy (CCB), were executed in 2014 as per the provisions of the applicable law.


-----

In August 2015, two of the transactions concluded in 2014 for the assignment of cash deposits in CCB were
terminated and as a result the assignments were cancelled with retroactive effect where Vivacom became a
titleholder of the assigned receivables in the amount of BGN 53,033 thousand (BGN 9,970 thousand, net of
impairment as of 31 December 2019). Despite of the validly executed transactions, the receivers of CCB have
not included the cancelled assignments in the list of accepted receivables of CCB creditors.

In 2020, remaining receivables representing cash and cash equivalents at CCB were assigned to InterV
Investment S.à r.l. for cash consideration equal to their net book value.

**_Fair value measurement_**

Fair value is the price that is assumed would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in
a common transaction between independent market participants at the measurement date. Fair value assumes
that such a transaction will take place in the principal market where such assets and liabilities are traded or, in
the absence of such principal market or, in case of lack of access to such market by Vivacom, in the market
where such a transaction would be most advantageous. For the purposes of financial reporting, certain of
Vivacom’s assets and liabilities are valued and presented at fair value. Such assets and liabilities presented at
fair value are (a) on a recurring (annual) basis: financial assets through other comprehensive income, financial
assets through profit or loss, investment property, loans granted or borrowings received to/from third or
related parties, certain trade and other receivables and payables, finance lease receivables and payables, and
(b) on a non-recurring (period basis): non-financial assets such as property, plant and equipment.

**_Determining the lease term and the incremental borrowing rate_**

In determining the lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic
incentive to exercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods
after termination options) are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended
(or not terminated).

If there are significant penalties to terminate (or not extend), or any leasehold improvements are expected to
have a significant remaining value, Vivacom is typically reasonably certain to extend (or not terminate). Other
factors including historical lease durations and the costs and business disruption required to replace the leased
asset are also considered. For lease contracts with indefinite term or short-term technical site rentals the
Vivacom estimates the length of the contract to be equal to the economic useful life of non-current assets
located in the leased property.

To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Vivacom uses a buildup approach that starts with a risk free
interest rate adjusted for credit risk for the country and the company and makes adjustments specific to the
lease, e.g. term, currency and security.

**_Macro-Economic Overview_**

We operate most of our business across the following eight countries in South Eastern Europe: Bulgaria,
Greece, Serbia, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina (“B&H”), Montenegro and North Macedonia.
These countries have a combined population of approximately 37 million people, distributed across
approximately 15 million households. Despite economic differences, these countries share a joint history and
form a single market in which small local differences are overshadowed by the influence of similarities in
cultural preferences and language across the region. As a result, this region is one of the three largest markets
in CEE, along with Poland and Romania. The following table provides an overview of our countries of
operations:

Over the past fifteen years, our eight countries of operations have implemented significant political and
economic reforms aimed at, among other things, reducing economic and structural imbalances, increasing the
flexibility of their respective economies (including liberalization of the media and telecommunications
sectors), and creating a business friendly environment that is conducive to foreign investment. As a result of
such reforms, Slovenia and Croatia were admitted to the European Union in 2004 and 2013, respectively.
Bulgaria joined the European Union in 2007 and Greece in 1981 (and adopted the euro in 2001). Serbia
officially applied for European Union membership in 2009, received full candidate status in 2012 and in
January 2014, the first accession negotiations took place. Negotiations are ongoing with several Chapters
having been opened up for discussion and review. Montenegro was granted candidate status in 2010 and the
accession negotiations started in June 2012. North Macedonia has been a candidate for accession to the
European Union since 2005, and in 2009 the European Commission recommended that accession negotiations
be opened. Bosnia and Herzegovina formally applied for EU membership in February 2016 and in
December 2016 and has received the accession questionnaire from the European Commission.

The macroeconomic environment is improving in our four core countries (Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia and
Slovenia). Real GDP growth in our four core countries is and will continue to be the key driver of private
consumption and disposable income growth.

Bulgaria’s economy has experienced a slightly negative growth for the period from 2018 to 2020, with real
GDP decreasing by 0.2% from 2018 to 2020. However, real GDP per capita from 2018 to 2020 increased by
0.5%. Furthermore, in 2020, unemployment rate increased by 0.9 percentage points, driven by COVID-19.
From 2018 to 2020, the unemployment decreased by 0.6 percentage points.

In Greece, positive growth in disposable personal income is expected to continue, supported by expanding
employment, wage growth and a stable inflow of worker remittances. Unemployment rate dropped by
0.8 percentage points in 2020. From 2018 to 2020, the unemployment decreased by 2.9 percentage points.


-----

In Serbia, the growth in real GDP per capita is expected to continue, driven by monetary policy relaxation,
structural reforms and supported by expanding employment. Unemployment rate dropped by 1.5 percentage
points in 2020. From 2018 to 2020, the unemployment decreased by 3.8 percentage points.

Growth is further driven by solid expansion in household spending as well as a trade surplus. Capacity
utilization levels in industry and services have reached their highest level since 2007 and conditions for
investment (e.g. high profits and low interest rates) remain favorable, which could potentially drive capital
spending growth. Higher than expected employment and rising disposable income has led to healthy private
consumption growth. Strong fiscal performance could support gradual reduction of public debt as a share of
GDP. Eurozone membership allows the country to benefit from the credibility of the European Central Bank’s
monetary policy and access to the Economic and Monetary Union’s highly developed capital markets.

In Slovenia, the economy has been significantly hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, with real GDP and real GDP
per capita decreasing by 6.1 percentage points. However, the country has experienced an increase in disposable
personal income (+5.7% YoY in 2020). Unemployment rate increased by 0.5 percentage points in 2020, while
from 2018 to 2020, the unemployment decreased by 0.1 percentage points.

With respect to the currencies in our three core markets, Slovenia has been a member of the Eurozone since
2007, the BAM is pegged to the Euro at a fixed exchange rate of BAM 1.9558 per €1.00 and the Serbian dinar
freely fluctuates against the Euro. The Serbian dinar depreciated against the Euro. Historically, Serbian
consumer price index (“CPI”) inflation has tended to more than offset depreciation of the Serbian dinar
against the Euro, leading to a constant “pass through” of the impact of the depreciation of the dinar to the
consumer.

We believe that our pricing strategy reflects the “pass through” principle outlined above. With respect to the
Croatian kuna, the long-time policy of the Croatian National Bank has been to keep the exchange rate
fluctuation of the kuna against the Euro within a relatively stable range.

Between 2018 and 2020, overall Pay-TV market penetration increased from 73% to 87% in Serbia, 76% to 77%
in Slovenia and stable at 68% in Bulgaria. This translated into substantial growth in subscribers at CAGRs of
10.1% (from 1,781 thousand to 2,160 thousand), 1.0% (from 637 thousand to 650 thousand) and (0.5%) (from
2,014 thousand to 1,993 thousand) during the corresponding period in Serbia, Slovenia and Bulgaria,
respectively.

The growth occurred primarily due to availability of increasingly attractive content, improving output quality
(mainly as a result of increasing digitalization rates), increased product functionality (e.g. video on demand
and CatchUp TV) and higher disposable income per household across the region.

The positive growth in the number of Pay-TV subscribers is expected to continue in Serbia and initiate in
Bulgaria, with estimated penetration rates in 2024 of 90% and 72%, respectively. The positive growth in Serbia
and Slovenia is expected to be driven by increasing demand for digital TV and other value add services that
can be delivered through digital TV platforms, such as VoD and CatchUp TV.

  - Cable

Cable Pay-TV is characterized by easy to use technology, quick installation of customer equipment and
reliability of signal delivered directly to the home. Population density is a key factor for cable operators when
deciding whether to invest in extending their existing cable network. A higher population density reduces the
overall cost associated with the deployment, operation and maintenance of cable infrastructure and allows for
mass marketing. Cable operators that operate in urban areas with high population density benefit from easier
access to customers and more cost effective network upgrades and maintenance expenditures. As a result,
cable networks in South Eastern Europe are mainly concentrated across metropolitan regions in Bulgaria,
Serbia and Slovenia. As of December 2020, approximately 26% of households in Bulgaria, approximately
56% in Serbia and approximately 39% in Slovenia received their Pay-TV content via cable. The popularity of
cable Pay-TV in Serbia is a result of the attractive content available on cable television, the high service quality
and the capability to deliver interactive services such as VoD and CatchUp TV.

  - IPTV

As a consequence of improvements in broadband internet technology, IPTV is increasingly being used for the
distribution of television services and has traditionally been the second most commonly used distribution
medium for television services across South Eastern Europe. In Slovenia, IPTV has recently become the most
used distribution medium (56% of all households as of December 2020), supported by EU investment in
shared open fiber networks, which are accessible to all operators for a fee. However, as these shared open fiber
networks have been built with the objective of making high quality services available in rural parts of Slovenia,
these networks have traditionally had a limited impact on our cable footprint, which typically covers urban
and high population density areas. The principal providers of IPTV are Telekom Slovenije and T2 in Slovenia,
Telekom Srbija (who regularly offers IPTV at a significant discount to attract subscribers) in Serbia and
Bulsatcom in Bulgaria.


-----

  - DTH-TV

DTH has traditionally been the third most commonly used distribution network medium for television services
in South Eastern Europe region after cable and IPTV. Pay-TV content owners can penetrate rural areas more
cost efficiently through DTH than through fixed line cable networks which are economically unviable to
develop because of low population density in rural areas. Satellite operators, such as our own Total TV and
competitors, such as Digi and Max TV, distribute digital signals via satellite directly to television viewers. To
receive DTH, viewers need a satellite dish and a set top box. Depending on the service provider, viewers may
also require a smart card for the subscription based and premium television services distributed via satellite.

As of December 2020, approximately 46% of households in Bulgaria that had subscribed to Pay-TV services
received their content via DTH, compared to approximately 16% in Serbia and approximately 5% in Slovenia.
We believe that the majority of DTH Pay-TV subscribers live in rural areas without access to a cable network,
which limits the overlap between our cable Pay-TV and DTH Pay-TV offerings.

  - OTT

Another emerging technology is the delivery of television content “over-the-top” of an existing broadband
internet network, which allows Pay-TV distributors to reach customers through the internet. We operate two
of our own OTT content platforms: our regional OTT platform (which operates under the EON brand of
products and services) and our international OTT platform, NetTV Plus. Our regional OTT platform offers
customers of our broadband internet competitors within the region access to our full digital Pay-TV channel
offering. As a result, EON subscribers can watch all of our digital Pay-TV channels on their TV screens,
computers, tablets, mobiles or other internet enabled devices. Through NetTV Plus, we deliver extensive local
and regional content, to the entire former Yugoslav expatriate community worldwide. Like EON, our
subscribers can watch Net TV Plus directly on their TV screens, computers, tablets, mobiles or other internet
enabled devices. We are a leading provider of Pay-TV services across our three core markets.

We mainly compete with local incumbents in our three core markets (Telekom Slovenije in Slovenia, Telekom
Srbija in Serbia and Bulsatcom in Bulgaria), as well as with other local players (T2 in Slovenia, Telekom
Srpske, HT Eronet and A1 Bulgaria in Bulgaria, among others). We have managed to maintain our leadership
and grow our market shares across our three core markets due to high quality content offering, excellent
customer care, positive brand perception and better value and product propositions.

Broadband

_Overview_

The broadband internet market in our core markets is characterized by continued growth and increasing
demand for high speed broadband internet services, which ultimately contributes to increasing internet service
penetration rates:

**_Broadband Penetration Rates (% of Total Households)[(1)], 2020_**

(1) Broadband penetration is calculated over total households; does not include mobile broadband services.

Fixed broadband internet household penetration rates in Bulgaria grew from approximately 65% in 2018 to
72% in 2020, in Serbia from approximately 59% in 2018 to 66% in 2020 and in Slovenia from approximately
73% in 2018 to 75% in 2020. This translated into substantial growth in the number of subscribers at CAGRs
of 5.3% (from 1,904 thousand to 2,113 thousand) in Bulgaria, 5.6% (from 1,447 thousand to 1,613 thousand)
in Serbia and 2.2% (from 607 thousand to 634 thousand) in Slovenia during the same period. At the same
time, fixed broadband penetration rates lag behind the penetration rates of more developed European markets,
such as France, UK and the Netherlands.

We believe that the positive growth in the broadband internet market in our three core markets also stems
from the overall increasing importance of the internet as the primary communication medium of choice as
well as from a decrease in end user equipment costs, leading to increasing usage of personal computers and
smartphones. By 2024, broadband internet penetration rates are expected to reach 82%, or 2,351 thousand, of
households in Bulgaria, 73%, or 1,765 thousand, of households in Serbia and 84%, or 722 thousand, of
households in Slovenia. As data consumption demand grows in households, the penetration rate of high
speed broadband (lines capable of providing at least 30 Mbps) is expected to increase rapidly in Slovenia and
Serbia in the coming years. The Serbian “Strategy for the Development of Broadband and Networks and
Service,” adopted in 2014, established a target of 100% coverage with 30 Mbps by 2020 and 50% coverage for
100 Mpbs in an effort to align with EU targets.

  - DSL

DSL uses basic telephone infrastructure to access the internet. DSL technology leverages the fact that copper
wires used in telephone networks have a much higher bandwidth (7 MHz) than that required for normal voice
conversation (0 3.4 KHz). DSL utilizes the extra bandwidth to provide broadband internet connections. The
most commonly used variant of DSL is ADSL which assumes that internet users normally receive or
download significant more information than they would send or upload. Hence, ADSL connections normally
have three to four times more bandwidth for downloading. However, as copper is a distance sensitive medium,
access speeds for DSL technology decrease substantially as the distance from DSL hubs increases. The
maximum download speed of DSL networks has to be shared between all services: television, broadband
internet and telephony. Under currently available technology, DSL based multi-play providers can therefore
not provide broadband internet and television services of comparable quality to those provided over cable
networks. Another variant of DSL is VDSL, a DSL technology that provides a faster data transfer rate than
ADSL technologies. It is an access technology that exploits the existing infrastructure of copper wires that
were originally deployed for traditional telephone service as a way of delivering very high speed internet
access.


-----

Historically, DSL has been distribution platform and accounted for approximately 6% of all internet
connections in Bulgaria, 37% in Serbia and 28% in Slovenia at the end of 2020. However, its market share has
been consistently eroded by upgraded cable networks which offer higher quality service and higher speed as
well as by the steady development of fiber based networks.

  - Cable

Cable networks have been designed for the transmission of large amounts of analogue TV and radio signals
and are able to deliver consistent speeds irrespective of the distance to the customer, unlike DSL. United
Group companies are leading cable providers in the region with fully bi directional network, largely
EuroDOCSIS 3.0 enabled and offering up to 220 Mbps download speeds, with the upgrade path up to 1.2
Gbps. Furthermore, the deployment of EuroDOCSIS 3.1 technology will allow cable operators to provide
data download speeds as high as 10 Gbps and data upload speeds as high as 2 Gbps over existing hybrid
fiber/coax (“HFC”) lines (with full duplex EuroDOCSIS 3.1, upstream capacity will also be as high as 10
Gbps). EuroDOCSIS 3.1 when deployed enables us to compete head on with fiber networks. In addition to
faster download and upload speeds, EuroDOCSIS 3.1 also offers other tangible benefits, such as higher
bandwidth capacity, better operational efficiencies, higher quality control, real time performance analysis and
lower costs. All these other tangible benefits should be available without necessarily upgrading existing HFC
networks or adding more fiber lines. EuroDOCSIS 3.1 is also backward compatible with Euro DOCSIS 3.0,
which allows us to roll out the new specifications seamlessly, on an incremental basis.

In 2020, cable distribution accounted for 14%, 50% and 30% of all broadband infrastructure in Bulgaria,
Serbia and Slovenia, respectively.

  - FttH

FttH is based on optical fiber cables and is the only infrastructure that offers similar speeds. Currently, FttH
broadband internet connections play a very limited role in Serbia. FttH had a broadband market share in
Slovenia of approximately 41% as of December 31, 2020, compared to approximately 35% in 2018. The main
providers of FttH in Slovenia are Telekom Slovenije and T2. The increase in the FttH broadband market
share is primarily due to extensive fiber roll out by Telekom Slovenije and T2 in 2009, as well as EU investment
in municipally owned open fiber networks. As fiber roll out is more expensive than cable and the open fiber
networks have traditionally been built with the objective of making high speed broadband internet and IPTV
services accessible in rural areas, we believe that any competitive impact on cable operators will be limited, as
these operators traditionally provide services in more urban and high density areas (i.e. no overlap).

FttH is the technology of choice by United Group for greenfield expansion and new buildings in adjacent
areas.

  - Other Broadband Internet

We also compete with service providers that use other alternative technologies for broadband internet access,
such as satellite technologies or mobile standards such as WiMax, universal mobile telecommunications
system (“UMTS”) and high speed packet access (“HSPA”). These mobile broadband internet access
technologies may allow both incumbent and new broadband internet access providers the ability to provide
high speed connection services for voice, data, video and television. We estimate that only a small portion of
households were using UMTS/HSPA for primary broadband internet access via laptops or PCs in 2014. We
believe that the majority of mobile broadband internet users presently use mobile internet services to
complement, rather than to replace, fixed line broadband internet.


-----

_Competition_

We are the leading provider of broadband services within our footprint with 22%, 33% and 29% of the market
share in Bulgaria, Serbia and Slovenia, respectively, as of 2020:

Due to material overbuild in metropolitan areas in Slovenia, we face competition from other Slovenian
broadband internet providers, such as T2 and Telekom Slovenije who both offer FttH and, Telekom Slovenije,
Amis and T2 who each offer VDSL. In Serbia, we believe that cable overbuild is relatively low and largely
concentrated in Belgrade. The Serbian cable market remains relatively fragmented and we believe that due to
our scale in the market as well as our acquisition history, we are well positioned to continue consolidating the
Serbian cable market and thereby increasing our overall market share. Similar to Serbia, cable overbuild is
relatively low in Bosnia and Herzegovina (mainly in the Sarajevo region) and our primary competitors are the
incumbents in the ethnic regions in which we operate, BH Telecom, Telekom Srpske and HT Eronet, as well as
regional cable operators, who all offer multi-play bundles at discounted prices. However, we believe we have a
competitive advantage due to our attractive content offering and high broadband internet speed. The Bosnian
cable market remains relatively fragmented and we also believe that we are well positioned in the market to
continue consolidating the Bosnian cable market and thereby increasing our overall market share.

Fixed Telephony

_Overview_

Similar to the rest of Europe, fixed line penetration rates in our three core markets has been decreasing
recently and this trend is expected to continue:

_Technology_

We provide fixed line telephony services in Bulgaria, Serbia and Slovenia, using VoIP telephony technology.
VoIP technologies place and transmit telephone calls over the internet instead of using the traditional PSTN.
Following the liberalization of fixed line telephony markets in Serbia, all telephony markets in our three core
markets are now fully liberalized, providing us with significant growth opportunities. Slovenia is one of the
few European telephony markets in which VoIP technology accounts for the majority of the fixed line
telephony connections. We believe that this increase in VoIP market share was primarily driven by lower prices
of VoIP connections compared to PSTN connections which are often offered as part of a competitively priced
cable or FttH internet and television bundle.

_Competition_

Historically, the respective incumbent (Telekom Slovenije in Slovenia, Telekom Srbija in Serbia) in two of our
three core markets, has been the largest provider of fixed line telephony in each respective market. However,
following the liberalization of the region’s telephony markets and the introduction of VoIP technologies,
which allows customers to make traditional fixed line telephone calls using a standard telephone handset and
provides comparable quality to PSTN at lower prices, the respective Bulgarian, Serbian and Slovenian
incumbents have generally lost market share to us:

We believe that consumers increasingly select fixed line telephony providers by the quality of the
accompanying Pay-TV and broadband internet offerings or total bundle value, and we believe that cable


-----

operators are well positioned to take advantage of this consumer preference. We offer attractive VoIP packages
in Slovenia which include free calls to all fixed phone subscribers within our network, including to Serbia and
Bosnia and Herzegovina. We believe this offering is particularly attractive because a number of Slovenian
residents have family in Serbia or Bosnia and Herzegovina who they can reach at no additional charge through
our packages. Since late 2012, we have become the second largest provider of fixed line telephone services in
Serbia, behind the incumbent Telekom Srbija. Moreover, largely due to the introduction of full telephone
number portability in April 2014, we have significantly increased the number of our fixed line telephony
subscribers in Serbia. We expect this trend to continue. Similarly, in Bosnia and Herzegovina we offer VoIP
telephony services as part of our cable and television bundle.

Residential Segment (Mobile)

_Slovenian Mobile Market_

_Overview_

Following our acquisition of Tušmobil in April 2015, we provide mobile telephony services in Slovenia as an
MNO. There were approximately 2.5 million mobile subscribers in Slovenia as of December 31, 2018, which
resulted in a penetration rate of 119%, below the average mobile penetration rate in Europe. The number of
mobile subscribers in Slovenia grew at a CAGR of approximately 1.5% between 2014 and 2018. We believe
mobile penetration in Slovenia is still below the penetration benchmarks provided by certain developed mobile
markets in Western Europe, such as Germany and Sweden, supporting continued subscriber growth potential
in the market. The Slovenian mobile market is a predominantly contract (post-paid) market.

136%


There has been a continuous decline in Slovenian mobile termination rates (“MTR”) since 2008. MTR
asymmetry in the Slovenian market was eliminated as of January 1, 2013, when MTR for all operators became
€0.0324 per minute. In July 2014, the Slovenian regulator, AKOS, announced a significant reduction in MTRs
to €0.0114 per minute and implemented this rate for all Slovenian operators with effect from September 1,
2014. Following this reduction, Slovenian MTR was brought closer in line with the target EU benchmark of
€0.01 per minute, indicating limited further downside.

_Licenses_

  - Spectrum Licenses

The first ever spectrum auction in Slovenia was completed in April 2014 with the award of several frequency
bands to three mobile operators: Telekom Slovenije, Si.mobil (now A1) and Tušmobil (Telemach Slovenia).
Three of the four MNOs (T 2 did not participate) acquired the following bands: A1 acquired total of 90 MHz
on paired 800, 900, 1800 and 2600 MHz and a total of 45 MHz on unpaired 2100 and 2600 MHz; Telekom
Slovenije acquired a total of 85 MHz on paired 800, 900, 1800 MHz and a total of 25 MHz on unpaired 2600
MHz band, Telemach Slovenia acquired a paired spectrum of 5 MHz on 900, 10 MHz on 1800 as well as 10


-----

MHz in the 800 MHz band which is widely recognized as the most efficient band for 4G LTE roll out. The
licenses were awarded for a long term tenure of 15 years which we believe represents a significant barrier to
entry for a potential fifth MNO.

In July 2016, AKOS announced its decision to conduct an auction for various mobile spectrum bands in
Slovenia that remained unallocated. These included frequencies in the 1800 MHz band and the 2100 MHz
band. AKOS set the reserve price at €2.6 million for each block of 2x5 MHz in the 1800 MHz frequency band,
two blocks of which were available for auction, and €1.3 million for the block of 2x5MHz in the 2100 MHz
band, one block of which was available for auction. On August 5, 2016, we submitted our tender for these
frequencies. On August 29, 2016, AKOS issued a decision in our favor on the allocation of two blocks of 2x5
MHz in the 1800 MHz frequency band and one block of 2x5 MHz in the 2100 MHz frequency band for an
aggregate amount of €6.6 million. Telemach Slovenia’s license for the frequencies in the 1800 MHz band is
valid through January 2031, and for the frequencies in the 2100 MHz band is valid through September 2021.
Telemach Slovenia currently possesses 60% less spectrum compared to its main two competitors. In April
2021, we secured 15-year spectrum licenses in Slovenia for 5G frequencies, and commenced deployment and
commercial launch of 5G 3600 MHz in Slovenia in June 2021. We believe additional frequencies will be
needed to be able to address our growing mobile business, especially in the domain of mobile broadband.

On September 2020, we announced the commercial launch of our 5G network in Bulgaria and, to that end, in
May 2021, we secured a 20-year license for 100 MHz spectrum frequencies in the 3.6 GHz band.

_Competition_

Telekom Slovenije is the largest mobile operator in the market, with a market share of 40% as of December 31,
2020. Telemach Slovenia had a market share of 24% as of December 31, 2020. The mobile markets in Bulgaria
and Serbia are led by incumbents as well as mobile players that are part of international groups. Historically,
international groups have invested in mobile operations only in Serbia, and we believe the limited focus of
international groups in the rest of our core region is set to continue, potentially offering interesting acquisition
opportunities for us.

Bundles

Customers in our three core markets increasingly seek to receive their multimedia and communications
services in a bundled offer from one provider. In response, service providers are providing television,
broadband internet and fixed line and mobile telephony services in bundled offerings; such bundled offerings
are marketed as the best value for money. We believe that bundled offerings allow media and


-----

telecommunication service providers to better meet customers’ communication and entertainment demands,
increase average revenue per customer while also increasing customer loyalty and attract new customers via
an enhanced value proposition.

As of December 31, 2018, approximately 81% of unique fixed line customers are bundled customers in
Telemach Slovenia. Fixed and mobile convergence was approximately 43% as of December 31, 2018 with 1.9
SIMs per customer on average. As of December 31, 2018, SBB Serbia and Telemach BH had bundle
penetration of 80% and 74% respectively. While such convergence has occurred at a relatively fast pace in a
number of Western and Eastern European markets, notably in Slovenia, a series of regulations, including
those limiting alternative operators other than the incumbent service providers from providing telephony
services in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, have historically prevented such convergence to occur in our
three core markets. However, the relatively recent liberalization of the Serbian and Bosnian fixed line telephony
markets is accelerating the convergence in our three core markets. The ability to bundle products and services
plays an important role in our three core markets, and we believe cable operators will be well positioned to
benefit from this.

**_B2B Segment_**

Almost all businesses in our three core markets (Bulgaria, Serbia and Slovenia) have internet/broadband
connections. Large companies and small and medium enterprises can receive the following services from
telecommunications companies: infrastructure and transport (dark fiber, wavelengths and synchronous digital
hierarchy), co-location, enterprise connectivity (including internet access, Ethernet and multiprotocol label
switching, virtual private network/wide area network, security and managed services), hosting & cloud storage
(including infrastructure as a service and platform as a service) and voice.

According to Solon, business fixed data spending (which includes internet access (comprising connection
charges and monthly fees, excluding equipment costs), Ethernet (installation and monthly services charges),
internet protocol virtual private networks (costs of underlying broadband and dedicated connections,
excluding dial line rental and usage charges), very high bandwidth services (upfront connection and monthly
service charges on optical and dark fiber services) and legacy data services (digital leased line, Frame Relay
and asynchronous transfer mode connections)). We expect the business fixed data spending to remain
relatively stable. In more developed markets, additional spending for co-location, hosting & cloud storage is
typically around three times the amount of fixed data spending.

**Media Overview**

Despite economic differences, the countries of South Eastern Europe have a joint history and form a single
media market in which local differences are compensated by the influence of similarities in cultural preferences
and language across the region. Television is by far the main source of news and information in our three core
markets. Through United Media, we play a significant role in this attractive market and even offer our own
content, including some of the region’s most popular sports, news, children and general entertainment
channels. We believe that the Nova TV Croatia Acquisition, which includes Nova TV (the most viewed channel
in Croatia) enhances our media offering and strengthens our leadership position in Croatia. In
September 2018, we completed the Direct Media/Pink Acquisition, a leading media buying agency in Serbia.
The Direct Media/Pink Acquisition included its operations in Montenegro, North Macedonia and Albania
as well as its terrestrial TV stations Pink BiH and Pink Montenegro. On October 22, 2018, we rebranded these
channels as Nova BH and Nova M to facilitate synergies with Nova TV in Croatia. In 2019, we also launched
Nova S in Serbia, which although a Pay-TV channel, is structured as a full format national TV station with
attractive talk shows, sports and own production local fiction series in the market. In January 2021, we
acquired Nova BG, the largest Bulgarian multi-platform media company. The acquisition perfectly
complements UG’s Vivacom operations, as the leading media group in the country.

**_Broadcasting_**

_Overview and Technology_

Television in Slovenia was first introduced in 1958, with the launch of JRT RTV Ljubljana (now RTV
Slovenija) as the first TV station. Following the independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, the Mass Media Act
which was passed in 1994, laid out the specific model for the privatization of media in Slovenia. The Mass
Media Act was revised in 2001 and 2006 to define clear rules for ensuring media pluralism. Today, TV market
in Slovenia is operated by both state owned and for profit corporations and is mainly shared between public


-----

service RTV Slovenia and private stations Kanal A and Pop TV. Kanal A was the first commercial TV station
which launched in 1991, followed by Pop TV which launched in 1995.

Television in Serbia was first introduced in 1958 with state owned Television Belgrade, now known as Radio
Television of Serbia (“RTS”). The Serbian broadcasting system evolved from a public monopoly into a dual
system of public and private stations. The switch over from analogue to digital terrestrial television in the
country was completed in 2015.

Television in Bosnia and Herzegovina was first introduced in 1956 and since then, it has now developed into
a market with both private and public channels. Three public TV stations (BHT1, FTV and RTRS) are
operating within the Public Service Broadcasting system and are financed from radio and television fees.
Together with private stations, as well as regional public stations, they form the national TV market. The
Pay-TV market is significantly fragmented with the majority of private TV stations being locally focused.
However, there are a number of players that aim to capture a wider audience throughout the country (for
example, N1 of Telemach BH). The process of TV digitalization is still ongoing in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Television in Croatia was first introduced in 1956 with Television Zagreb. Today there are four channels with
nationwide coverage. Digital video broadcasting terrestrial signal broadcasting was introduced in 2002, with
the full digital switchover being completed by 2010 via gradual ceasing of analogue TV throughout the
country.

**_Advertising_**

Across our three core markets, television is the medium of choice for advertising, accounting for approximately
50% of total advertising spent. The internet, as a medium of choice for advertising, is expected to grow at
higher rates than television, but will still remain below television in coming years. The average daily viewing
time across the three core markets ranges from approximately 3.5 to 5.5 hours demonstrating the importance
of TV as medium for information and entertainment. Most importantly, the demand for TV is relatively
inelastic. TV continues to offer a unique proposition to advertisers: enormous scale, fast reach, very high
quality advertisement inventory and an attractive contextual environment for brand building. As a result, TV
advertising should continue to be resilient, with any gradual volume reductions more than offset by price
inflation.

Television broadcasting in each of our markets is regulated by a governmental authority or agency. For
example, privately owned broadcasters in Slovenia are allowed to broadcast advertising for up to 12 minutes
in any hour, whereas the public broadcaster, Radiotelevizija Slovenija, is allowed to broadcast advertising for
up to 10 minutes per hour given the additional financing from TV licensing fees. Between the hours of
6:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m., the advertising time limit is reduced to seven minutes for the public broadcaster. In
Serbia, advertising time is regulated on an hourly and daily basis, where commercial broadcasters are restricted
to 20% of the daily broadcasts and to 20% per hour of broadcasting. Similarly to Slovenia, in Croatia the
permitted advertising time per hour is 12 minutes with no daily limit and direct sales advertising must be at
least 15 minutes.

The advertising markets in South Eastern Europe have benefitted from robust macro-economic conditions.
Advertising spend in our core three countries (Slovenia, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina) is expected to
grow faster than real GDP, with TV channel advertising remaining resilient. The recent decline of advertising
spend in Croatia resulted from bankruptcy of one of Croatia’s biggest company, Agrokor, which employed
approximately 60 thousand total staff members and its revenues accounted for more than 15% of Croatia’s
total GDP.

The Direct Media/Pink Acquisition, completed in September 2018, focuses on targeted advertising and
specialized Pay-TV and positions us at the forefront of digital advertising in the region. As a result, we
acquired the know-how of more than 100 of the best professionals in the region who provide significant
synergies with the broader operations of the Group.

Combined Group’s addressable market comprised 13.4 million households as of December 31, 2020.

We have grown rapidly through both acquisitions and organic growth. In July 2020, we acquired Vivacom, the
market leading integrated telecommunications operator in Bulgaria, based on total revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2020, which is the leading operator in fixed-line telephony services and broadband services, the
number three provider of mobile-telephony services and the number three provider of Pay-TV, in each case,
by number of subscribers as of March 31, 2021. The Vivacom Acquisition increased our addressable market
by approximately 35% in terms of population, and the addition of Vivacom’s subscriber base more than
doubled our existing subscriber base. In March 2020, we also acquired Tele2 Croatia, the third largest
telecommunications operator in Croatia, based on mobile revenues as of March 31, 2021, through which we
offer mobile services in Croatia. In November 2020, we completed the acquisition of a controlling interest in
Forthnet S.A., a prominent telecom operator and Pay-TV provider in Greece, which marked our entry into
the Greek market and will strengthen our position as an industry leader in Southeastern Europe. In
January 2021, we acquired Bulgaria’s largest multi-platform media company, Nova Broadcasting Group
EOOD, from Advance Media Group EAD, providing a strong base for our content offering in Bulgaria. In
July 2021, we signed an agreement to acquire a majority interest in Optima Telekom, a Croatian telecom
operator offering a broad range of fixed internet and pay-TV services. Subject to its completion, the Optima
Telekom Acquisition will allow us to further expand our presence in the Croatian market and offer a full range
of telecommunication services, including pay-TV, through our existing infrastructure in the country.

We offer a diverse and differentiated line of products and services. We are the leading distributor of satellite
(“DTH”) Pay-TV across Southeastern Europe, with Pay-TV product and service offerings in each of Slovenia,
Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia and Montenegro, where we use our Total TV platform to
serve subscribers both inside and outside of our cable footprint to deliver content across the entire region,
including rural areas. Following the Vivacom Acquisition, we also provide Pay-TV services in Bulgaria and
are the leading IPTV provider in Bulgaria, while the Nova Broadcasting Group Acquisition strengthened our
content offering in Bulgaria. Following the Forthnet Acquisition, we also provide cable and DTH services in
Greece. In addition to our cable-based and satellite-based services, we offer mobile-telephony services in
Slovenia, Bulgaria and Croatia. We provide 4G LTE coverage to almost the entire population in each of these
countries, and we are rolling out 5G networks across our mobile-telephony footprint. On September 21, 2020,
we announced the commercial launch of our 5G network in Bulgaria, and to that end in May 2021, we
secured a 20-year license for 100 MHz spectrum frequencies in the 3.6 GHz band. We also in April 2021
secured 15-year spectrum licenses in Slovenia for 5G frequencies, and commenced deployment and
commercial launch of 5G 3600 MHz in Slovenia in June 2021. We are participating in a 5G spectrum auction
in Croatia this year.

Our core telecommunications business is also complemented by our two OTT distribution platforms that
customers can access through internet based streaming: EON, our regional OTT platform, which enables
customers connected to our competitors’ broadband internet connections outside of our cable footprint to
access our attractive portfolio of Pay-TV channels, and NetTV Plus, our international OTT platform, which
delivers ethnic and local language content to the ex-Yugoslav diaspora around the world. In July 2020, we
launched Shoppster, our regional e-commerce online-shopping platform, which offers more than 20 popular
product categories, including electronics, home and gardening, tools, fashion, items for children and kitchen
appliances. Shoppster is available as an integrated online and TV shopping platform in Serbia and Slovenia.


-----

Through our in-house content business, we produce distinctive and attractive in-house media content for our
Pay-TV channels across multiple key genres that have historically driven Pay-TV subscriptions. These channels
include Southeastern Europe’s most popular family of branded Pay-TV sports channels, as well as popular
movie channels, children’s channels, a 24/7 news channel, music channels and other specialized channels,
which we continue to expand both organically and through acquisitions. We currently produce over 40% of
the total content in our national (terrestrial) and cable operations, and our programs typically receive ratings
of between 30% to 60% in the markets in which they are available. The Group also has in-house media and
content production in Greece. We believe that our market leading content portfolio differentiates us from our
competitors, has enabled strong growth in our business and provides us with predictable third-party carriage
fees.

As part of our media business, we also provide advertising services and digital production and distribution.
Our Nova TV Croatia channel has strong local content production and profitability, with an audience share
of 40% and market share by advertising revenue of 50%. Nova BH and Nova M have appealing content, such
as popular national team football events until 2022, such as the Euro Cup qualifiers, Euro Cup, World Cup
qualifiers and League of Nations. In March 2019, we launched Nova S in Serbia. Nova S is a channel offering
high-quality local production series, sports, talk shows with well-known national presenters and high-quality
international productions, fully exclusive to SBB, Total TV and EON. The Nova Broadcasting Group
Acquisition makes us a major content player in Bulgaria by adding Nova BG’s media platform comprising
ten television channels, including NOVA TV, which broadcasts throughout Bulgaria, Bulgaria’s largest online
platform, Net Info, which reaches on average 80% of the Bulgarian population each month, and four radio
stations.

In addition to our own content, as a result of our pan regional presence and well established distribution
network, we are a distribution partner of choice for premium regional and international content owners, such
as Discovery/Eurosport, Viacom, AXN, CNN, HBO, Fox and Universal, and sports rights owners, such as
the English Premier League, Spanish Football League LaLiga, 2020 UEFA European Championship
qualifiers, 2020 UEFA European Championship, 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, UEFA League of Nations,
ATP, Formula 1, Euroleague, and Moto GP, which we believe allows us to consistently obtain high-quality
content and attractive payment terms. Nova BG holds licenses to offer compelling content in Bulgaria through
distributors such as CBS Intenrational, the Walt Disney Company, Columbia Pictures and Paramount
Pictures, as well as popular sports content such as the English Premier League football, Euro Cup qualifiers
and the Euro Cup and Formula One racing. We believe these providers partner with us because of our
well-known brands, large network and our focus on Southeastern Europe.

We operate most of our business across eight countries in Southeastern Europe: Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and
Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Greece. These countries have a
combined population of approximately 40 million, distributed across approximately 13.4 million households
as of December 31, 2020, and represent the second-largest CEE market after Poland. Despite economic
differences, many of these countries share a joint history and form a single market in which small local
differences are overshadowed by the influence of similarities in cultural preferences and language across the
region and are characterized by growing Pay-TV and broadband markets that are currently underpenetrated
relative to some other CEE and Western European markets.

We are the leading multi-play provider in Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Bulgaria, where we
combine our services into packages, or bundles, which offer subscribers the convenience of being able to
purchase television, broadband internet and telephony services from a single provider, and provides us with
significant opportunities to cross-sell our products.

We believe that we are well-positioned to maintain our market leading positions in the Pay-TV and cable
broadband internet markets in Slovenia, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to further increase our
market shares, as we differentiate our product offerings through one of the highest download speeds in our
broadband markets, access to desirable media content, a well invested network and high-quality customer
service, which has led to relatively low churn rates which we believe demonstrate customer loyalty. We also
believe that we are well-positioned to continue to grow in our region, and build on our expansion into Bulgaria
and Greece. Our customers view the telecommunications products and services that we offer as part of their
everyday lives, which results in recurring, high demand for our products and makes our business more resilient
to macro-economic disruptions when compared to other discretionary products and services. For example,
during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic our products and services have been instrumental in providing
connectivity and entertainment, as an increasing number of people began to work or study remotely and
spent significant amounts of time at home, which resulted in a significant increase in our voice and data
traffic between March and May 2020. In particular, over this period, our fixed data traffic increased at rates


-----

between 50% and 70%, while fixed voice traffic increased at rates between 50% and 85%, depending on the
country. In addition, our mobile data and voice traffic increased at rates between 30% and 40%, depending on
the country. Traffic levels decreased during the summer months and started increasing again as new lockdowns
were implemented in various countries. To accommodate such higher customer demand, we increased capacity
on network elements and interconnections. In this recurring, high demand environment, we believe we offer
superior products, faster broadband speeds and higher quality content than many of our competitors.

**Competitive Strengths**

We believe a number of key factors give us a competitive advantage, including:

**_We are the leading multi-play service provider with a pan regional platform across Southeastern Europe._**

We are the leading multi-play telecommunications and media provider in Southeastern Europe, a position
which we have strengthened significantly through the Vivacom Acquisition. Specifically, we are the leading
provider of Pay-TV in our three core markets of Slovenia, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the
leading provider of broadband in Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, in each case, based on market share
by number of subscribers. We are also the leading provider of broadband and the number three provider of
Pay-TV in Bulgaria based on market share by number of subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2020,
and the second-largest Pay-TV operator in Greece. In addition to our cable-based and satellite-based services,
we offer mobile-telephony services in Slovenia, in Bulgaria and in Croatia. The acquisitions we have made
have delivered significant geographic expansion and diversification of our business into Bulgaria and Greece.
The Vivacom Acquisition, for example, increased our addressable market by 35% in terms of population, and
doubled our existing customer base. Furthermore, our scale and presence across Southeastern Europe and
across our product portfolios allows us to cross-sell our services and expand the number of multi-play
packages we provide, creating opportunities to expand our customer base.

The table below shows key operating and financial data of the Group as of and for the three months ended
March 31, 2021, except where otherwise noted.

(1) Market position is based on total subscribers.

(2) We are the leading high-speed cable broadband internet provider in each of Serbia, Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina and
Bulgaria within our footprint, and we have the second-largest broadband and telephony market share in each of these countries,
behind the respective incumbents with national footprints. In Bulgaria, following the acquisition of Vivacom, we have the largest
broadband and fixed-line telephony market share.

(3) Company Cable RGUs consist of Pay-TV, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony Company RGUs.

(4) Company DTH RGUs in Slovenia include Company RGUs for DTH services provided in Slovenia and internationally, prepaid
DTH services and Pink International (which distributes Pink channels in Western Europe) and DTH North Macedonia.

(5) Based on aggregated revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2021, United Group’s Media Group’s external revenue
represented 14% of our total aggregated revenue for the same period; figures for Nova BG for the period prior to its acquisition by
us are based on management accounts.

(6) This figure includes 1.8 million homes passed through Vivacom’s FTTP / VDSL network. Forthnet uses OTE’s wholesale Local
Loop Unbundling (LLU) and Bitstream services for its fixed network access across Greece.

(7) Most Cable RGUs for Forthnet represent broadband and fixed-telephony. Customers of Forthnet are serviced through a local loop
unbundling arrangement with the incumbent OTE.

We are the pan regional leader for Pay-TV services with 2.6 million unique Pay-TV subscribers as of March 31,
2021, and we have leveraged our complementary cable and DTH platforms to gain a leading Pay-TV market
share of 46% in Serbia, as of March 31, 2021, 39% in Slovenia as of December 31, 2020, and 41% in Bosnia
and Herzegovina, as of December 31, 2020, 26% in Bulgaria, as of December 31, 2020, and 28% in Greece, as
of December 31, 2020, each based on number of subscribers. In addition, we are the largest DTH Pay-TV
provider in Montenegro and are among the main providers of DTH Pay-TV in North Macedonia and Croatia.

We are the leading high-speed cable broadband internet provider in each of Slovenia, Serbia and Bosnia and
Herzegovina within our footprint in each country and have a large broadband market share overall, behind
only the respective incumbents with national footprints. In Bulgaria, we are the market leader in broadband
by number of subscribers, with a market share of 33% as of December 31, 2020.

We leveraged our Pay-TV and cable broadband internet capabilities to become the second-largest fixed-line
telephony provider in Slovenia, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Following the liberalization of the
telephony markets in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia, which allowed customers to retain their existing
telephone number when switching to our network in 2014, we have substantially grown our fixed-line
telephony subscriber numbers. In addition, in Bulgaria, we are the market leader in fixed-line telephony, with
a 66% market share by number of subscribers as of September 30, 2020.

In mobile-telephony, we are the third largest MNO in Slovenia, with a market share of 24% as of March 31,
2021. We are also the third largest MNO in both Bulgaria, with a market share by number of subscribers of

30%, and Croatia, with a market share of 19%, in each case, as of March 31, 2021. Between 2017 and 2019,
Vivacom’s mobile revenue grew at a CAGR of 4%, demonstrating Vivacom’s strong momentum in the mobile
market. In July 2020, we leveraged our position in both the broadband and Pay-TV markets to launch
Shoppster, our regional e-commerce online-shopping platform, which offers more than 20 popular product
categories, including electronics, home and gardening, tools, fashion, items for children and kitchen
appliances. Shoppster is available as an integrated online and TV shopping platform in Serbia and Slovenia.
In Serbia, Shoppster operates as a marketplace using the dropshipping operating model, whereby it does not
stock the products it sells. In Slovenia, Shoppster operates as a retailer as a result of an acquisition that we
have completed and stores the products it sells in a leased warehouse. Products sold though Shoppster are
distributed by third-party delivery couriers in both Serbia and Slovenia. Shoppster is a unique offering which
combines the convenience of online-shopping with the audience engagement of television. Products are
presented and available for sale on the Shoppster TV channel, which is devoted to home-shopping. Popular
TV personalities from Southeastern Europe present offers and products from the many companies that have
joined Shoppster. We intend for Shoppster to deliver the simple, reliable and secure e-shopping experience
that modern consumers expect.

**_We benefit from diversified revenue streams within our markets and an improved currency mix._**

Due to our leading market positions in Slovenia, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and our position as a
pan regional services provider, our business benefits from geographically diversified and product portfolio
diversified revenue streams, which we have further diversified following the Vivacom Acquisition and Forthnet
Acquisition. In terms of geographic diversity, the table below presents the percentage of revenue derived by
jurisdiction (as a percentage of gross revenue, excluding intercompany revenue) for the three months ended
March 31, 2021, after giving effect to the Vivacom Acquisition, the Tele2 Croatia Acquisition, the Forthnet
Acquisition, the Nova Broadcasting Group Acquisition and other acquisitions:

based on management accounts.

We also benefit from a currency mix that sees 85% of our gross revenues generated in euros or in geographies
where the currency is pegged to the euro in the three months ended March 31, 2021, which is a significant
increase compared to a currency mix of 65% of our gross revenues generated in euros or in geographies where
the currency is pegged to the euro in the three months ended March 31, 2020.

**_We are a recognized media leader benefitting from content ownership, own production and strategic partnerships_**
**_with international and regional broadcasters providing a differentiated Pay-TV offering._**

We believe that we are the recognized media leader in Southeastern Europe, offering fully integrated
production and distribution of attractive and distinctive local content that caters to the whole family. As of
March 31, 2021, we produced 45% of our content locally. Our content seeks to address the entire Southeastern
European region, which has a large population with similar languages, cultures and entertainment preferences
and which we believe forms a single media market. The Vivacom Acquisition and Forthnet Acquisition added
an additional seventeen million people in the region to our addressable market. Our focus on the entire
Southeastern European region allows us to maintain and serve some of the smaller markets where providers
with a smaller scale in comparison to us are less able to provide first rate localized content on an economically
efficient basis. We believe international players would find it difficult and costly to expand into the region, due
to language and cultural barriers. Furthermore, our pan regional operations make it possible for us to enter
into contracts on attractive terms with major sporting leagues and other third-party contract providers to
distribute their content to the entire region with a population, including Bulgaria, of approximately 40 million,


CroatiaCroatia


-----

whereas competitors operating in a single country within the region cannot offer similarly broad coverage. We
are also able to offer our content partners value added services such as providing subtitles for television shows
and can spread the costs across our operations in the entire region, whereas we believe such costs would not be
economically justifiable for a competitor operating within a single country in the region.

Media activities at United Media fall into four categories: channel production, distribution, advertising and
digital. We believe that several factors make us an attractive partner to third-party content owners: our pan
regional presence, large subscriber base, advanced network, cable and DTH platforms and leading market
positions. We also offer attractive advertising services with desirable advertising slots, which we sell to both
local advertisers and high-profile clients from around the world. We work with advertisers to tailor
advertisements to their target audiences, and we have begun to generate revenue from the sale of advertising
across our platforms, particularly in our television stations and on our broadcast and cable networks. We have
also established a digital music production and content distribution business. Following the Nova TV Croatia
Acquisition and Direct Media/Pink Acquisition, we significantly developed our media business by adding
leading full format TV stations in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro. Nova TV Croatia has
strong local content production and profitability, with an audience share of 40% and market share by
advertising revenue of 50% as of December 31, 2020. Nova BH and Nova M have appealing content, such as
popular national team football events until 2022 (Euro Cup qualifiers, Euro Cup, World Cup qualifiers and
League of Nations). In March 2019, we launched Nova S in Serbia. Nova S is a channel offering high-quality
local production series, sports, talk shows with well-known national presenters and high-quality international
productions, fully exclusive to SBB, Total TV and EON. The Nova Broadcasting Group Acquisition makes us
a major content player in Bulgaria.

With our own content, we can control the end-to-end creation process, produce a wide range of attractive
local and genre specific content and maintain a structural hedge on content costs. Our in-house production
has significantly increased over recent years, and the content offered has continually improved, including by
way of the leading Sport Klub channel by adding popular sporting events to our content portfolio, which
includes some of the most popular sports offerings in the region, some of which have been temporarily
suspended and/or postponed during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we have sold distribution
rights for this channel to all major third-party distribution platforms in the region, who pay a recurring
carriage fee. Due to our own distribution platforms and our relationships with all major third-party
distribution platforms in the region, we are able to immediately distribute new channels throughout the region,
including Bulgaria following completion of the Vivacom Acquisition.

Our business model is attractive and resilient. We believe our portfolio of must have products and our superior

ability to up sell and cross-sell products. Our customers view the telecommunications products and services
that we offer as part of their everyday lives, which results in recurring, high demand for our products and
makes our business more resilient to macro-economic disruptions when compared to other discretionary
products and services. For example, during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic our products and services have
been instrumental in providing connectivity and entertainment, as an increasing number of people began to
work or study remotely and spend significant amounts of time at home, which resulted in a significant increase
in our voice and data traffic between March and May 2020. In particular, over this period, our fixed data
traffic increased at rates between 50% and 70%, while fixed voice traffic increased at rates between 50% and
85%, depending on the country. In addition, our mobile data and voice traffic increased at rates between 30%
and 40%, depending on the country. To accommodate such higher customer demand, we increased capacity
on network elements and interconnections. In this recurring, high demand environment, we believe we offer
superior products, faster broadband speeds and higher quality content than our competitors. Customer loyalty
is evidenced by our relatively low historical churn rates. Churn rate is defined as the percentage of customers
that no longer subscribe for a certain service compared to the average number of customers in a particular
month. Churn rates for a period of one year or longer are an average of the monthly average churn rate. For
the three months ended March 31, 2021, our unique cable subscriber churn rate annualized was 10%, which is
below recent reported cable subscriber churn rates of certain Western European peers. We believe our relatively
low churn rates provide, among other benefits, recurring cash flows and visibility with respect to future
revenue. Moreover, these churn rates have persisted notwithstanding regular price increases. From 2017, our
Blended Cable ARPU excluding Vivacom has grown from €20.5 for the nine months ended September 30,
2017 to €23.2 for the three months ended March 31, 2021, representing a CAGR of 3.6%. Average triple play
monthly fees have also increased across geographies, from €28 in 2013 to €33 for legacy packages (21% of
triple play base) and €34 for current EON packages (78% of triple play base) in Serbia, from €41 in 2015 to
€46 for legacy packages (28% of triple play base) and €48 for current EON packages (72% of triple play base)
in Slovenia, and from €27 in 2013 to €31 for legacy packages (21% of triple play base) and €32 for current
EON packages (78% of triple play base) in Bosnia and Herzegovina, each for the three months ended
March 31, 2021. In addition, Vivacom’s declining churn rates, together with our experience in driving customer
loyalty, present significant upside potential. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, Vivacom’s mobile
subscriber churn rate was 18% annualized compared to 25% for the year ended December 31, 2017, and its
IPTV subscriber churn rate was 11% annualized compared to 15% for the year ended December 31, 2017.

**_Our business and market positioning benefit from a well invested, advanced cable network infrastructure with a_**
**_broad reach across the region and from national mobile networks in Slovenia, Bulgaria and Croatia._**

We strive to be the most advanced media and telecommunications company in Southeastern Europe. We
operate an advanced proprietary HFC network which is fully bi-directional and EuroDOCSIS 3.0 enabled,
covering all of our homes passed in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro, and approximately
98% of homes passed in our HFC network in Slovenia as of November 1, 2020 are fully bi-directional. We
operate the largest fiber network in the region, comprised of 8,966 kilometers of backbone and extending
10,119 kilometers across metropolitan regions in Slovenia (approximately 3,506 kilometers), Serbia
(approximately 4,907 kilometers), Bosnia and Herzegovina (approximately 1,080 kilometers) and Montenegro
(approximately 626 kilometers). We also operate one of the largest fiber networks in Bulgaria, with 1.7 million
(or 58%) of households in the country covered and a fully owned fiber connecting to major points of presence
across Europe. As of March 31, 2021, 91% of our core network was DOCSIS 3.1 ready. With the addition of
Vivacom’s cable network, our cable network covers approximately 3.7 million homes passed, as of March 31,
2021. Our network has an average homes passed per fiber optics node ratio in the range of approximately 274,
213 and 234 across Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, respectively, which we believe is unrivalled in
Southeastern Europe and compares favorably to other European cable operators, which average 562 homes
passed per node on the basis of comparable peers operating in UK, Sweden, Spain, Germany and Belgium.

We believe that our cable TV infrastructure allows us to provide higher quality digital TV, high-speed
broadband and fixed-line telephony than other cable operators in our markets. Our EuroDOCSIS 3.0 network
allows us to compete effectively in Slovenia, where FttH constituted approximately 44% of the broadband
market share as of December 31, 2020. We can match FttH speeds in overlapping markets and have a service
speed advantage in non-FttH areas. In Serbia, our broadband internet speed gives us an advantage over most
of our broadband internet competitors, and we provide broadband speeds of 75-1000 Mbps for the majority
of our subscribers in Serbia. We also provide internet download speeds which we believe compare favorably to
the national average in Serbia with our average recorded download speed being 1.8x faster than that of one of
our main competitors. Additionally, we also believe that we provide superior internet download speeds in
Slovenia with our average recorded download speed being 2.9x faster than that of one of our main competitors
(which the competitor is only able to offer in certain geographic areas). In Bosnia and Herzegovina, we are


-----

well-positioned to compete with incumbents that primarily use DSL, as well as with smaller regional cable
operators. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, we believe that our average recorded download speed is 4.5x faster
than that of one our main competitors. In Montenegro, we have developed FttH GPON with over 25,438
homes passed and over 5,742 homes connected to this network. Following the Vivacom Acquisition, we
operate the largest fiber network in Bulgaria, providing VDSL with speeds of more than 70 Mbps for more
than 50% of our network and more than 50 Mbps for 74% of our network, with full redundancy capability
and high service reliability.

Our mobile network covers the majority of Slovenia’s population through our extensive 2G/3G/4G networks,
and at present we have the capability to provide 4G (LTE) and 4G+ (LTE-A) coverage to approximately 99%
and 98%, respectively, of the Slovenian population. We are also the third largest mobile operator in Bulgaria
by market share, with approximately three million subscribers as of March 31, 2021, and provide LTE mobile
network coverage to 99.94% of the Bulgarian population. We believe Vivacom’s mobile strategy, which
includes attractive tariff plans, flexible service bundles, integrated IT systems and the fastest 4G/LTE mobile
network in Europe, has allowed it to differentiate itself from competitors and consistently gain market share
in recent years. In addition, we are the third largest telecommunications operator in Croatia based on mobile
revenues as of March 31, 2021, with a highly competitive 4G service, a signal covering all major cities and
important roads in Croatia and a growing customer base of nearly one million as of March 31, 2021. To
further develop our networks, we have successfully tested and are rolling out next generation 5G networks
across our mobile-telephony footprint. On September 21, 2020, we announced the commercial launch of our
5G network in Bulgaria, and to that end in May 2021, we secured a 20-year license for 100 MHz spectrum
frequencies in the 3.6 GHz band. We also in April 2021 secured 15-year spectrum licenses in Slovenia for 5G
frequencies, and commenced deployment and commercial launch of 5G 3600 MHz in Slovenia in June 2021.
We are participating in a 5G spectrum auction in Croatia this year.

We believe that our cable network is well invested and benefits from low maintenance UG Adjusted Capital
Expenditure requirements. We believe that this will allow us to manage our UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure
in the near to medium term, with expenditures largely being success and capacity based as our business
expands, while making targeted improvements to our network. We believe that Vivacom has a similarly well
invested network and profile. UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure was €91.3 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2021, and we estimate that UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure for the year ended December 31,
2021 will be between €371 million and €373 million (excluding mobile frequencies and any amounts for
Forthnet, Nova BG or Optima Telekom ).

**_Strong track record of profitable growth driven by low penetration rates and cross-selling opportunities, as well_**
**_as successful integration of acquisitions._**

We have a strong track record of profitable growth, underpinned by low penetration rates in the markets in
which we operate and cross-selling opportunities due to our scale, as well as a record of successfully integrating
acquisitions. We operate most of our business across the following eight countries in Southeastern Europe:
Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, North Macedonia and Montenegro.
These countries are characterized by growing Pay-TV and broadband markets that are currently
underpenetrated relative to some other CEE and Western European markets. Following the Forthnet
Acquisition we also operate in Greece. As of March 31, 2021, in Slovenia, our Pay-TV penetration of homes
passed and broadband internet penetration were 61% and 89%, respectively; in Serbia, Pay-TV penetration
and broadband internet penetration were 65% and 73%, respectively; and in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Pay-TV
penetration and broadband internet penetration were 61% and 81%, respectively. Additionally, due to
historically strong regulatory constraints on bundling Pay-TV, broadband internet and telephony services,
RGUs per cable subscriber in our key markets in Serbia, Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina have lagged
behind CEE and Western European cable markets. Markets in Bulgaria have similar characteristics. Our cable
RGUs per subscriber ratios of 2.3x for Serbia, 2.7x for Slovenia and 2.3x for Bosnia and Herzegovina, in each
case as of March 31, 2021, demonstrate that there are strong opportunities to continue to utilize up selling
and cross-selling opportunities to grow our cable RGUs per subscriber ratio in Slovenia.


-----

The following table shows comparisons of RGUs per cable subscriber in certain key CEE and Western
European markets with those of certain other industry members:

Source: Public company filings. As of March 31, 2021, for United Group, Telenet and Euskaltel and as of June 30, 2018 for the other
industry peers. The methodologies used to calculate and report RGUs and RGUs per cable subscriber by certain other industry members
may vary.

At the same time, Pay-TV penetration in all of our markets has been growing, driven by increasingly attractive
content and bundled offers. Service penetration in our markets has increased as multi-play packages have
expanded but is still below the levels of some Western European cable markets (except in Slovenia). Leveraging
our extensive cable infrastructure, we use our high-quality Pay-TV content as a basis to cross and up sell our
broadband internet and telephony products to existing cable Pay-TV customers and offer multi-play packages
to new customers, which we expect will allow us to continue to improve penetration rates as customers
increasingly focus on the convenience of receiving their multimedia and communications services in a bundled
offer from one provider. For example, while penetration rates in Slovenia are more comparable to those of
Western European operators, a substantial number of our subscribers in Slovenia are subscribed to a single
service, which we believe offers significant cross-selling opportunities. Our number of quad-play subscribers
in Slovenia has grown since we began offering mobile services in late 2012 as an MVNO, and, since the
acquisition of Tušmobil in April 2015, we have increased the number of quad-play subscribers in Slovenia,
from 1% in April 2015 to 38% as of March 31, 2021.

In addition to organic growth, we have made targeted and value accretive investments and acquisitions of
attractive cable and mobile assets, and we have been successful at integrating these acquisitions and realizing
synergies related to a number of these acquisitions, providing lessons learned and significant know-how for
integrating Vivacom, Forthnet, Nova BG and Tele2 Croatia. For example, our acquisition of Telemach
Slovenia from Liberty Global in 2009, a foray into a new market with a different language and culture, proved
to be a successful cross border acquisition story. Within a decade, we tripled blended cable ARPU of Telemach
Slovenia (from €13 in 2008, to €35 in 2018) and adjusted EBITDA (from €24 million in 2008, to €71 million in
2018), while revenue grew from €46 million in 2008 to €1.2 billion in the year ended December 31, 2020. This
was achieved through both organic growth and the acquisition of Tušmobil in April 2015 which provided us
with an opportunity to create a fully convergent cable, internet, fixed-line and mobile-telephony operator in
Slovenia, and allowed Slovenian customers to benefit from a convenient bundled product offering consisting
of cable Pay-TV, internet, fixed-line and mobile-telephony services from a single provider.

**_We have a track record of delivering revenue and UG Adjusted EBITDA growth and realizing cost synergies_**
**_related to our acquisitions while generating strong UG Adjusted EBITDA margins._**

Our revenues have historically proven to be resilient, even during periods of challenging economic conditions.
During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, almost all of our revenue streams have proven resilient and stable,
particularly those generated by our telecommunication business segments, such as broadband internet and
mobile-telephony. Since 2018, we have increased RGUs from 3.8 million as of December 31, 2018, to
10.9 million as of March 31, 2021, and we have delivered strong organic growth in both revenue and UG
Adjusted EBITDA during such period, significantly outperforming GDP growth in the countries in which we
operate. In addition to organic growth, we have benefitted from targeted and value accretive investments and
acquisitions of attractive cable and mobile assets, and have been successful in integrating these acquisitions


-----

and realizing synergies related to them. Our revenue increased to €439 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2021, compared to €194 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, and UG Adjusted
EBITDA increased to €179 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to €85 million for
the three months ended March 31, 2020. We have also proven our ability to generate strong adjusted EBITDA
margins. Despite investments in new ventures, we had operating profit margin of 11% and 7% for the
three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively, and maintained UG Adjusted EBITDA margins
of 44% and 41% for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively, highlighting our successful
approach to integrating new businesses and driving profitability.

**_A highly experienced management team with a proven track record of supporting and growing our business_**
**_and successfully integrating accretive, cross border acquisitions, with a highly committed Sponsor._**

Many of our key management members have been with the business since its inception, including our founder
and chairman of the advisory board, Dragan Šolak; chief executive officer and group vice president of
marketing and media, Victoriya Boklag; and group vice president of operations, Violeta Vasilijević. Our
senior management team also includes Janez Živko, group vice president of finance, who joined in March 2015
and had previously served as the chief financial officer of the Petrol Group, one of the largest companies in
Slovenia; Vladislav Ratajac, group vice president of corporate development, joined management in 2011,
having previously held positions at Mid Europa Partners and Deutsche Bank; Željko Batistić, group vice
president of technology who joined the group in 2012 as CEO of Telemach Bosnia and prior to that held a
number of technical and operational management positions in the industry; and Dragica Pilipović Chaffey,
group vice president of corporate affairs, joined the management team in 2009 and had previously held a
number of senior posts in the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Other members of our
senior management team also have substantial experience in the telecommunications, media and technology
industry, as well as in banking, private equity and corporate finance firms. Many members of our senior
management team, including our founder, have each held different positions within our business and have
shaped the direction of our development and growth within Southeastern Europe. As our operations have
become more mature, the senior management team has been positioned to leverage its significant industry
experience and corporate background and to successfully expand our business through bolt on acquisitions
and integration of cable assets and content companies. Furthermore, certain members of management hold
significant equity stakes in the business, which amount to approximately 42%. See “Principal Shareholders.”
Due in part to the significant international experience of most members of the senior management team, who
either attended university abroad or worked internationally for a prolonged period of time, we have
successfully grown our business from being a single country Pay-TV operator to being the telecommunications
and media services leader in Southeastern Europe.

We also intend to draw from the market expertise, business relationships, knowledge and experience of our
sponsor, BC Partners. BC Partners has strong telecommunications expertise and an extensive and successful
track record of investing in companies in Europe and in the telecommunications and information sectors
through portfolio companies that include:

- Advanced Computer Software Group, which is a leading UK provider of critical software to mid-sized
companies and public sector organizations;

- NAVEX Global, which is the global leader in ethics and compliance software as a service provider;

- Suddenlink Communications, which was the seventh largest cable operator by subscribers in the United
States prior to its acquisition by Altice USA in 2015, and which BC Partners fully exited in 2020;

- Com Hem, Sweden’s leading cable TV and broadband operator, which was successfully floated on the
Nasdaq Stockholm exchange in 2014 and which BC Partners fully exited in 2017; and

- Unitymedia, an integrated telecoms service provider and the second-largest cable company in Germany,
which BC Partners sold to Liberty Global in 2009 after growing the business through acquisitions and
operational improvements.

BC Partners has a strong track record of driving cost savings and improvements in margin, while at the same
time growing its portfolio companies both organically and through targeted acquisitions.

**Strategy**

Our goal is to strengthen our telecommunications and media leadership position in Southeastern Europe and
to continue our strong growth momentum by successfully integrating Vivacom, Tele2 Croatia, Forthnet,
Nova BG, Optima Telekom and other acquisitions and by leveraging our competitive strengths: well invested


-----

fixed and mobile networks, differentiated content offerings and local production capabilities and a loyal
customer base. Our focus is on continuing to provide our customers the best products and services in each of
our segments and markets, including more innovative products and features, a superior customer experience
and better value compared to competitors. In parallel, our goals are to continue to deliver exceptional revenue
growth across segments (both organically and through strategic acquisitions) and capitalize on operating
leverage and continued operating efficiencies to deliver strong profitability and cash flow growth.

In order to achieve these goals, we have identified the following strategic pillars:

**_Continued focus on our competitive market position by leveraging our advanced network, differentiated_**
**_content offerings and loyal customer base._**

We have differentiated ourselves with our customers by having superior next generation infrastructure in our
footprint. Where we believe the return on investment is appropriate, we will continue to expand the coverage
and capacity of those networks, including 5G capability. Our strategy is to continue to offer the most attractive
products in Southeastern Europe with better content choice, speed, functionality and service quality than
those of our competitors, at prices that provide a compelling value. We will continue to deliver value to our
customers based on a consistent and effective strategy that is underpinned by simplicity, value for money and
innovation. We believe that our acquisitions of Vivacom, Tele2 Croatia, Forthnet, Nova BG and Optima
Telekom are in line with a strategy of expanding coverage in Southeastern Europe and will enable the
development of our business in attractive markets.

**_Increase service penetration across the region by cross-selling products and services and up selling value adding_**
**_products to existing customers._**

We intend to continue to focus on subscriber growth opportunities in our relatively under penetrated markets.
Over time, we expect our businesses in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina to converge with Slovenia in terms
of broadband and Pay-TV penetration as well as in service penetration (measured by RGU per subscriber).

We aim to achieve an increase in triple play (and in the case of Slovenia and Bulgaria, quad-play) penetration
by continuing to shift focus in marketing and subscriber interactions from single services to bundled services
and utilizing next generation digital television services, attractive local content and high-speed broadband
services to continue to promote bundled services. We have significantly grown our mobile business and
developed our multi-play (including quad-play) offering in Slovenia, and we intend to continue to build on
that success in Bulgaria, where the Vivacom Acquisition has significantly expanded our addressable market,
and provide further opportunities for cross-selling and multi-play bundling. In particular, we intend to leverage
Vivacom’s high-quality 4G/LTE network to expand its leadership in mobile data and build on its track record
of subscriber growth. In addition, we aim to retain and grow Vivacom’s existing customer base by competing
on value, for example, by offering more add on products, incentivizing longer term contracts by offering
better pricing and subsidies for certain products, offering bundled services to decrease churn, including
premium Pay-TV services and providing FTTx solutions in larger cities to satisfy customer demand for high
broadband speeds.

We also intend to capitalize on our superior high-speed broadband capabilities to increase revenue. Specifically,
we intend to migrate our existing high-speed broadband subscribers to higher speeds, which we believe will
continue to support broadband ARPU growth and further reduce residential subscriber churn rates. In
addition, recent acquisitions have enhanced our ability to monetize premium content, cross promote and
generate compelling cost synergies.

**_Consolidate United Media as the leading media company in Southeastern Europe._**

Since inception, our strategy has been centered on differentiating our offering by producing superior and/or
exclusive Pay-TV channels for our customers. We have applied this philosophy to all of our Group companies
with great success, and we have created an attractive portfolio of full format national as well as specialized,
thematic Pay-TV channels that we believe are a must have on all regional distribution platforms. Following the
Vivacom Acquisition, with the integration of Vivacom and Nova BG into our operations, we are applying
this philosophy in Bulgaria. We intend to continue to grow our content offering by further developing our
portfolio of owned content, entering into strategic partnerships with third-party content owners and acquiring
content owners, as in the past with the acquisition of Nova TV Croatia and Direct Media/Pink.

**_Further expand our addressable market by utilizing our OTT platform and attractive content._**

Leveraging our strong brands and our attractive content, we intend to continue to develop our two OTT
content platforms, our regional OTT platform, EON, and our international OTT platform, NetTV Plus, to


-----

further expand our addressable market to areas outside our cable footprint. While our DTH Pay-TV platform
aims to deliver our content to subscribers in rural areas in our markets without cable infrastructure, our
regional OTT platform enables customers in metropolitan areas outside of our cable footprint, who have
subscribed to the broadband internet services of our competitors, to access our attractive portfolio of Pay-TV
channels and unique user interface and customer experience. Additionally, NetTV Plus allows us to provide
over 200 local language channels showing ethnic content to the entire ex-Yugoslav diaspora around the world.
By expanding our geographic reach outside of Southeastern Europe to customers in countries in Western
Europe and North America, we believe that we are positioned to further increase our RGU base and earnings
potential. We also plan to further invest in our in-house development of customer premises equipment,
including OTT TV boxes for EON, which enables video streaming to customers’ TVs and allows us to offer
services on competitors’ broadband networks.

**_Continued focus on innovation._**

We seek to continue innovating and enhancing our product offering to further strengthen our leading position
in Southeastern Europe. Our in-house technology innovation and software development center, United.Cloud,
enables us to focus on leading the introduction of next generation television and broadband internet services
by delivering to subscribers services such as EON (our next generation video delivery platform that includes
linear and non-linear digital broadcasting, over 22,000 VoD assets, CatchUp TV, a Smart TV application for
Samsung and LG and a multiscreen service for mobile, tablet and personal computer/laptop devices),
UNIFON (our proprietary VoIP application connecting customers’ fixed-line telephones outside of their
homes), our self-help application, enhanced TV features such as VoD and CatchUp TV services and many
others. We will also continue to promote the digitalization of internal and external processes to improve
customer satisfaction and profitability. In July 2020, we leveraged our position in both the broadband and
Pay-TV markets to launch Shoppster, our regional e-commerce online-shopping platform, which will initially
offer more than 20 popular product categories, including electronics, home and gardening, tools, fashion,
items for children and kitchen appliances. We intend for Shoppster to deliver the simple, reliable and secure
e-shopping experience that modern consumers expect.

**_Continue to grow customer base and operations through value accretive acquisitions._**

We have a successful track record of making acquisitions on attractive terms and successfully integrating
those acquisitions. Between 2011 and March 31, 2021, we have acquired and integrated (or are in the process
of integrating) approximately 50 cable TV operators, content platforms, media companies, mobile service
providers, B2B service providers and ISPs in Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Greece,
Croatia and Montenegro. We have also expanded our addressable market through the Vivacom Acquisition
and Nova Broadcasting Group Acquisition (in Bulgaria), the Forthnet Acquisition (in Greece) and the
Optima Telekom Acquisition (in Croatia), as well as various other recent acquisitions. Our acquisition strategy
consists of expanding our scale in a value accretive manner, enhancing our content offering, expanding our
fixed-line and mobile-telephony operations and leveraging our experience and successful acquisition history
to continue to make acquisitions that allow us to generate additional value for our operations through
increasing scale and product offerings.

We plan to continue to make value accretive acquisitions at attractive multiples to integrate regional service
providers, cable assets and fixed-line and mobile-telephony operators into the business, and we intend to
continue taking a disciplined approach to acquisitions by assessing individual opportunities on the basis of
merit, ability to integrate assets into our existing business plans and potential for value creation.

**_Continue to Focus on Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (“ESG”) Matters_**

We and our shareholders recognize that achieving a sustainable and responsible business that has a positive
social impact will be key to our future success. As we have grown our Group, we have increased our emphasis
on integrating ESG considerations into our decision-making and reporting processes. In 2020, we established
a dedicated ESG coordinator role within the Group and finalized a detailed ESG action plan and
implementation roadmap in consultation with external advisors.

To promote environmental sustainability in our operations, we are taking active steps to minimize our
environmental footprint, while also collecting and analyzing Group historical data to set future KPI targets
for reductions in carbon emissions, climate change policy, energy use and energy sourcing. We have committed
to the Science Based Targets initiative which helps to drive climate action in the private sector by enabling
companies to set emissions reduction targets with scientific data. We are committed to reducing greenhouse
gas emissions across our offices and infrastructure and we established a solar power plant in Slovenia in 2019


-----

with an annual production capacity of 254 kWh and have leveraged our experience in this project to look for
additional green energy projects which could cover a significant part of our carbon emission footprint. In
addition, we use electric vehicles in our operations where feasible, and we work to exchange old, less-energy
efficient equipment for more energy-efficient devices. In 2020, we generated approximately 128.1 thousand
tons of CO2 emissions (9.3 thousand tons of scope 1 emissions and 118.8 thousand tons of scope 2 and
3 emissions), including the contribution of acquired companies, and we intend to reduce these to
approximately 50.6 thousand tons by 2030. In 2020, we recycled 1,539 tons of network telecom equipment,
batteries, cables, paper and cardboard. We are also committed to minimizing waste and we repurpose, reuse or
recycle 100% of returned customer devices and accessories.

We actively support the communities in which we operate, and in 2020, we named a Group-level director for
corporate social responsibility to coordinate efforts in this regard among our operating companies. We have
as a Group donated €4.5 million in 2020 and €2.0 million for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, to
groups and activities dedicated to protecting the environment, education and the socially vulnerable, as well
as other donations, such as donating personal protective equipment to help fight COVID-19. We have also
engaged in multiple community engagement activities in the past few years, with a focus on using our platform
to deliver knowledge to children (including programs for online safety), students, the general public and
disadvantaged groups, by leveraging our core competencies in broadband internet and other
telecommunications. For 2021, we aim to increase the percentage of staff participating in a community
engagement activity (e.g., volunteering time or knowledge), which in 2020 stood at 7%.

We focus on building a safe, fair and inclusive working environment for our employees. To inform our diversity,
inclusion and safety targets, we collect data on our workforce, such as gender mix (55% male, 45% female),
percentage of women in management positions (30%, including our Chief Executive Officer) and percentage
of disabled employees (1%), in each case as of March 31, 2021. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2021,
staff total turnover is 12% and we have experienced 50 workplace injury incidents. We also have mandated
diversity and inclusion rules, and have documented these in employee manuals at our Group companies,
which include, among others, statutory requirements related to workers’ rights and human rights (e.g., antidiscrimination and anti-mobbing) and annual employee eNPS measurements. To facilitate further
transparency and accountability, we plan to expand our anonymous suggestion boxes already present in
certain of our Group companies and establish whistle-blowing programs as a distinct transparency function.
We also offer training programs to employees which are focused on improving job-related technical and
management skills, as well as on compliance with our internal policies.

**History**

Our founder and group executive chairman, Dragan Šolak, founded the company as a Serbian cable TV
operator in 2000. Between 2001 and 2005, we grew our business by constructing an advanced cable network
throughout Serbia. We also consolidated several sub-scale family owned cable operators and successfully
integrated them into our business. We launched our DTH services, Total TV, in Serbia in 2006 and in Slovenia,
Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro in 2007 and expanded Total TV into Croatia in 2008 (divested in
2018) and North Macedonia in 2009. In 2007, we entered into a strategic alliance with Sport Klub, and we
acquired a controlling stake in the Ultra family of Pay-TV channels in 2009. As a result of our strategic
alliances, as well as the acquisition of local language television channels, we were among the first pay-TV
providers in Southeastern Europe to provide localized regional and international content.

In 2009, we acquired Telemach Slovenia, a leading triple-play provider in Slovenia, adding 160 thousand
subscribers to our operations. During 2010, our consolidation of three cable pay-TV operators in Sarajevo,
including KT Global Net, BH Cabel Net and ELOB, led to the formation of Telemach BH. In addition, over
recent years we have amassed a comprehensive portfolio of owned pay-TV channels, covering sports, movies,
news, music, general entertainment and children’s programming, through our United Media business, which
we have grown through focused and consistent investment. We continue to leverage our position as the sole
credible consolidator in the fragmented regional markets and have successfully acquired and integrated a
number of businesses since 2010, including Maxtel in 2016, a local B2B internet provider in Slovenia, and
Ikom in 2017, a cable operator in Serbia. In addition, following the acquisition of M kabl in 2016, a cable
operator in Montenegro, we have further expanded our subscriber base in Montenegro.

Following the liberalization of the fixed-line telephone markets in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia in
2011 and 2012, respectively, we launched fixed-line telephony services in these two markets and, leveraging
our existing cable pay-TV and broadband internet subscriber base, became the second-largest Serbian fixedline telephone services provider in June 2013. We also launched our MVNO services in Slovenia in late 2012
and became an MNO upon our acquisition of Tušmobil in 2015, which allowed us to provide quad-play


-----

bundles (cable pay-TV, broadband internet, and fixed-line telephony and mobile-telephony services) to our
subscribers in Slovenia, in addition to stand-alone mobile-telephony services.

In July 2018, we acquired Nova TV d.d. from CME B.V. We believe this acquisition, which included several
popular television channels in Croatia, is helping us create a strong mainstream media platform, which further
differentiates our distribution platform, promotes our pay-TV channel portfolio, drives continued growth
and creates a strong platform for additional bolt on, accretive acquisitions. In September 2018, we acquired
Direct Media, a leading media buying agency in Serbia, which included Direct Media’s operations in Serbia,
Montenegro, North Macedonia and Albania, as well as our terrestrial TV stations Pink BiH and Pink
Montenegro, which have been rebranded Nova BH and Nova M, respectively.

On March 3, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Tele2 Croatia, the third largest telecommunications
operator in Croatia based on mobile revenues as of September 30, 2020. Tele2 Croatia seeks to offer the best
value proposition in the Croatian mobile market, for example, through its offering of unlimited mobile
services. Now trading as Telemach Croatia, the acquisition has enabled us to accelerate our growth and further
diversify our operations.

On July 31, 2020, we completed our acquisition of Vivacom, the market leading integrated
telecommunications operator in Bulgaria (based on revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020) which
offers both fixed and mobile telecommunications services, as well as broadcasting and satellite services, with
a market share of 30% in Bulgaria by revenue as of December 31, 2019, according to the CRC. Expansion in
Bulgaria increased our addressable market by approximately 35% in terms of population, and the addition of
Vivacom’s subscriber base more than doubled our existing subscriber base. Vivacom’s size, including
approximately three million mobile subscribers, 514 thousand fixed-telephony subscribers, 4 64 thousand
fixed broadband subscribers and 489 thousand pay-TV subscribers, provides us with significant additional
scale, compounding our existing leadership. We believe that the acquisition of Vivacom provides us with
greater scale and increases business diversification, expands our reach, cements our position as the industry
leader in Southeastern Europe and continues our growth.

In September 2020, we completed the acquisition of a significant minority interest in Forthnet S.A., a
prominent telecom operator and Pay-TV provider in Greece, and in November 2020, we acquired a controlling
interest in Forthnet. Forthnet provides home entertainment and communications services to nearly 1.4 million
RGUs. This marked our entry into the Greek market and strengthens our position as an industry leader in
Southeastern Europe. Forthnet is the second-largest Pay-TV operator in Greece. The Forthnet Acquisition
enables us to accelerate our growth and further diversify our Group

In January 2021, we acquired Bulgaria’s largest multi-platform media company, Nova Broadcasting Group
EOOD, providing a strong base for our content offering in Bulgaria.

In July 2021, we signed an agreement to acquire a majority interest in Croatian telecommunication operator
Optima Telekom. Optima Telekom offers a broad range of fixed broadband internet services to approximately
117 thousand subscribers and pay-TV services to approximately 57 thousand subscribers in Croatia. Upon
completion, the Optima Telekom Acquisition will allow us to further expand our presence in the Croatian
market enabling us to offer a full range of telecommunication services, including pay-TV, through our existing
infrastructure.

(1) Product brands have been rolled out in Bulgaria and Greece as of the date of this offering memorandum.

- Cable pay-TV. Our analog and digital cable pay-TV services provide our subscribers access to an attractive
portfolio of standard definition (“SD”) and high definition (“HD”) pay-TV channels that offer popular
local and regional content. As an additional service, we offer our pay-TV subscribers access to our
proprietary pay-TV content “on the go” through our TV everywhere applications for computer, tablet and
mobile devices. We offered cable and IPTV pay-TV services to approximately 1,479 thousand subscribers
across Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria and Montenegro as of March 31, 2021,
including 290 thousand subscribers through Vivacom.

- DTH Pay-TV. Our DTH pay-TV service, known as Total TV, is targeted at households outside our cable
footprint and, as of March 31, 2021, provides access to an attractive portfolio of channels to approximately
991 thousand subscribers across seven Southeastern European markets (Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and
Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Greece Montenegro and North Macedonia). In Greece, Forthnet operates a DTH
Pay-TV service.

- Regional OTT. Our regional OTT platform, which operates under the EON brand of products and services,
allows us to reach customers of our broadband internet competitors and allows these customers to access
our full digital pay-TV channel offering on their TVs, computers, tablets, mobile devices or other internet
enabled platforms. Our regional OTT platform enables us to serve residents in Serbia and Slovenia who are
currently outside of our cable footprint but have access to broadband internet connection with our pay-TV
products.

- International OTT. NetTV Plus is our OTT content platform which delivers a broad range of local and
regional content to members of the entire former Yugoslav diaspora worldwide. NetTV Plus had
102 thousand subscribers as of March 31, 2021, indicating significant future growth opportunities,
supported by the global proliferation of high-speed internet access, which makes OTT one of the most
viable platforms to access ethnic content.

- Broadband internet. We believe that we operate the largest broadband internet network in the region and
deliver among the fastest broadband connections in our markets with speeds of up to 1.0 Gbps. Our
network has been fully upgraded to EuroDOCSIS 3.0, which supports speeds of up to 1,200 Mbps. We
offered broadband internet to approximately 1,396 thousand subscribers across Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia
and Herzegovina, Bulgaria and Montenegro as of March 31, 2021, including 476 thousand subscribers
through Vivacom. We offer out-of-footprint internet services (broadband internet services provided through
a third-party network) across Greece to approximately 528 thousand subscribers through Forthnet as of
December 31, 2020. Following completion of the Optima Telekom Acquisition, we will offer boardband
internet services to approximately 117 thousand subscribers in Croatia.

- Fixed-line Telephony. We offer telephony services using voice over internet protocol technology (“VoIP”),
which allows our subscribers to make traditional fixed-line telephone calls using a standard telephone

handset. We offered fixed-line telephony to approximately 1,269 thousand subscribers across Slovenia,
Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria and Montenegro as of March 31, 2021, including 514 thousand
subscribers through Vivacom. We also offer out-of-footprint telephony services (telephony services provided
through a third-party network) across Greece to approximately 536 thousand subscribers through Forthnet
as of March 31, 2021.

- Mobile-telephony. We offer mobile-telephony services in Slovenia (through Telemach Slovenia) and Croatia
(through Telemach Croatia), where we operate as an MNO in each country. Vivacom also offers mobiletelephony services in Bulgaria as an MNO. As an MNO, we are able to provide a broad array of subscription
options, comprehensive data packages and enhanced coverage through our own mobile network. As of
March 31, 2021, we offered mobile-telephony services to approximately 2,953 thousand subscribers in
Bulgaria, 596 thousand subscribers in Slovenia and 923 thousand subscribers in Croatia.

- United Media. Our media business produces several pay-TV channels across key genres and sells them to
third-party pay-TV distribution platforms in the region. We also produce various TV formats which are
then sold to free-to-air TV channels in the region. In addition, our media business provides advertising
services and digital production and distribution. Since 2012, we have produced pay-TV channels across all
genres, including entertainment, sports, news, eSports, kids, TV series and movies. We also partner with
regional and international content owners who seek to provide their content in Southeastern Europe and
have long-term contractual relationships with several of them. In addition, we offer attractive advertising
services with desirable advertising slots which we sell to both local advertisers and clients from around the
world. We have also established a digital music production and content distribution business, and in 2018,
we bolstered our media business with the Nova TV Croatia Acquisition. In Greece, United Group acquired
rights through Forthnet to offer compelling content such as sporting events, and Forthnet also offers content
under its own Nova-branded channels and holds content rights through multi-year contracts with major
international media companies such as Sony, MGM and Warner Bros. In Bulgaria, Nova BG holds rights
to compelling content and also offers popular sports content such as English Premier League football and
Formula One racing.

- E-commerce. In July 2020, we leveraged our position in both the broadband and pay-TV markets to launch
Shoppster, our regional e-commerce online-shopping platform, which will initially offer more than 20
popular product categories, including electronics, home and gardening, tools, fashion, items for children
and kitchen appliances. Shoppster is available as an integrated online and TV shopping platform in Serbia
and Slovenia. In Serbia, Shoppster operates as a marketplace using the dropshipping operating model,
whereby it does not stock the products it sells. In Slovenia, Shoppster operates as a retailer as a result of an
acquisition that we have completed and stores the products it sells in a leased warehouse. Products sold
though Shoppster are distributed by third-party delivery couriers in both Serbia and Slovenia. Shoppster is
a unique offering which combines the convenience of online-shopping with the audience engagement of
television. Products will be presented and available for sale on the Shoppster TV channel, which will be
devoted to home-shopping. Popular TV personalities from Southeastern Europe will present offers and
products from the many companies that have joined Shoppster. We intend for Shoppster to deliver the
simple, reliable and secure e-shopping experience that modern consumers expect.

**_Pay-TV_**

We provide analog and digital cable pay-TV throughout our network in Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and
Herzegovina, Bulgaria and Montenegro. As of March 31, 2021, we provided our cable pay-TV services to
212 thousand subscribers in Slovenia through Telemach Slovenia (61% of homes passed), 736 thousand
subscribers in Serbia through SBB Serbia (65% of homes passed), and 208 thousand subscribers in Bosnia
and Herzegovina through Telemach BH (61% of homes passed). In Bulgaria, Vivacom offers DTH and IPTV
services throughout the country. As of March 31, 2021, Vivacom provided pay-TV services to approximately
521 thousand subscribers in Bulgaria. Following completion of the Optima Telekom Acquisition, we will
offer IPTV services to approximately 57 thousand subscribers in Croatia. In line with our business strategy,
we leverage our extensive cable network and distinctive cable pay-TV content to encourage our subscribers to
purchase one of our bundles, which offer the convenience of being able to receive television, broadband
internet and telephony services from a single provider. As of March 31, 2021, approximately 82% of our cable
pay-TV subscribers had purchased one of our bundles. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, our
analog and digital cable pay-TV business segment generated revenues of €51.6 million and an average ARPU
of €11.3.

We offer high-quality analog and digital pay-TV throughout our network. All of our pay-TV customers receive
our analog pay-TV service (“Basic TV”). Our Basic TV package has been standardized across our network


-----

and offers customers access to over 54 analog TV channels in Serbia, over 15 in Slovenia, and over 54 in
Bosnia and Herzegovina. In addition to Basic TV, we provide our customers with the option to subscribe to
our digital cable pay-TV services (previously offered under our D3 brand and now offered under the EON
brand of products and services), and we focus on migrating analog subscribers to digital services and on
continuing to take advantage of the cross and up selling opportunities provided by an influx of potential new
customers switching from analog to digital cable pay-TV. Our digital cable pay-TV service provides our
customers with access to between 106 and 310 digital channels depending on the particular market, including
up to approximately 88 HD channels and 162 radio stations. We offer channel line ups across a variety of
popular genres, such as sports, children’s entertainment and movies. We believe our high-quality and broad
channel and content offering allows us to take a distinctive position in the market as compared to our
competitors. In July 2020, in cooperation with Bosnian operator Trion Tel, we started offering EON bundle
packages in Republika Srpska (the Serbian part of Bosnia and Herzegovina), where we previously had no
cable presence, through the GPON of Trion Tel.

In addition to our bundles, we also offer our subscribers digital add on TV packages, each containing premium
SD and HD television channels, such as HBO, as well as bundled VoD options for subscribers who have
leased one of our digital receivers. Our digital cable pay-TV service also includes CatchUp TV and VoD
services. CatchUp TV provides subscribers with the ability to view a wide variety of television programs from
a group of popular channels at any time within seven days after the programs originally aired. VoD provides
subscribers with access to a library of over 26,000 movies and other programming titles, either on a
transactional basis or a monthly subscription contract.

In 2012, we launched our TV everywhere applications (previously offered under the D3 Go brand name and
now offered as one of our EON brand of products and services) for computer, tablet and mobile devices in
2012. Through these applications, we provide our existing cable pay-TV subscribers with access to our digital
pay-TV content “on the go.”Our TV everywhere content is also available to our mobile subscribers in Slovenia
over our mobile network.

_Telemach Slovenia_

Our Pay-TV penetration in Slovenia was 61% as of March 31, 2021. Our number of cable Pay-TV subscribers
in Slovenia increased was 212 thousand as of March 31, 2021. According to Fitch Solutions, in 2018, the total
pay-TV market (which includes cable, IPTV and DTH subscribers) in Slovenia was estimated at 649 thousand
subscribers compared to 259 thousand subscribers for Telemach Slovenia (including cable, IPTV and DTH
subscribers) as of March 31, 2021, which we believe represents significant growth potential in the pay-TV
market in Slovenia. As of March 31, 2021, 100% of our cable pay-TV customers are subscribed to digital TV.

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, Telemach Slovenia’s cable pay-TV services generated revenues of
€12.2 million and an ARPU of €18.0.

Our pay-TV penetration in Serbia was 65% as of March 31, 2021, and our number of cable pay-TV subscribers
in Serbia was 736 thousand as of March 31, 2021. According to Fitch Solutions, in 2018, the total pay-TV
market (which includes cable, IPTV and DTH subscribers) in Serbia was estimated at 1.6 million subscribers
compared to 963 thousand subscribers for SBB Serbia (including cable, IPTV and DTH subscribers) as of

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, SBB Serbia’s cable pay-TV services generated revenues of
€23.7 million and an ARPU of €10.5.

pay-TV subscribers in Bosnia and Herzegovina was 208 thousand as of March 31, 2021. According to Fitch
Solutions, in 2018, the total pay-TV market (which includes cable, IPTV and DTH subscribers) in Bosnia and
Herzegovina was estimated at 817 thousand subscribers compared to 344 thousand subscribers for Telemach
BH (including cable, IPTV and DTH subscribers) as of March 31, 2021, which we believe represents
significant growth potential in the pay-TV market in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, Telemach BH’s cable pay-TV services generated revenues of
€6.9 million and an ARPU of €10.6.

across our network.

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, Telemach MNE’s cable pay-TV services generated revenues of
€1.1 million and an ARPU of €11.5.

Vivacom offers IPTV services throughout Bulgaria which includes attractive content and user friendly
features. Vivacom’s had 290 thousand IPTV pay-TV subscribers as of March 31, 2021. Vivacom’s IPTV
offering includes over 240 channels with more than 75 HD channels, as well as the corresponding equipment.

with a number of major content providers and provides IPTV GO service to customers outside the area of
coverage of its network in Bulgaria. Vivacom also offers mobile TV under its TV GO brand. Customers can
choose between a mix of over 90 channels and sports content with DiemaXtra and MAX Sport Plus, or one

subscribers can order any content available on TV GO directly on the recently updated application with a new
UI/UX design.

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, Vivacom’s cable pay-TV services generated revenues of
€7.8 million, representing 24% of its fixed-line revenue for the same period.

_Direct to Home Pay-TV_

Our DTH, or satellite, pay-TV service, known as Total TV, is targeted at households outside our cable footprint
across Southeastern Europe. Since January 2018 we have not offered pay-TV services in Croatia, due to the
divestiture of our Total TV operations in Croatia in connection with the Nova TV Croatia Acquisition.
Following the acquisition of Forthnet, United Group also offers DTH pay-TV across Greece to approximately
313 thousand subscribers. Total TV provides subscribers with access to up to 122 channels in Serbia, 53 of
which are also available in HD format, 126 channels in Slovenia, 49 of which are also available in HD format,
and 129 channels in Bosnia and Herzegovina, 48 of which are also available in HD format. In Bulgaria,
Vivacom offers DTH pay-TV with over 160 channels, 20 of which are in HD, as well as multi-feed with over
200 additional channels. In Greece, Forthnet offers DTH pay-TV under the Nova Sports, Nova Cinema and
Nova Go brands, with 75 channels, 47 of which are in HD. As we only actively market our DTH offering in
those areas that are outside our cable footprint, there is limited to no overlap with analog and digital cable
Pay-TV offering. Additionally, there is a low risk of cable pay-TV cannibalization, due to the fact that, for a
similar price as basic DTH pay-TV services, our basic cable pay-TV services offer a better value.

As with our analog and digital cable pay-TV offering, customers can choose from a range of DTH packages
across different price points. Additionally, we have entered into partnership agreements with Telekom Slovenije
in Slovenia and Telekom Srbija in Serbia pursuant to which we offer DTH pay-TV content and re sell their
respective ADSL internet services to customers outside of our cable footprint.

As of March 31, 2021, we provided our Total TV services to approximately 992 thousand subscribers
throughout Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Greece, North Macedonia and Montenegro.
For the three months ended March 31, 2021, our DTH Pay-TV business segment generated revenues of
€37.2 million and an ARPU of €12.4.

_OTT Television_

Our two OTT content platforms: our regional OTT platform (previously branded as D3i, now operating
under the EON brand) and our international OTT platform (NetTV Plus), have enabled us to further expand
our reach:

- Regional OTT. Our EON regional OTT platform enables customers of our broadband internet competitors
within Serbia and Slovenia (but outside of our cable footprint) to access our distinctive digital content via
the internet. Unlike our DTH pay-TV platform, which aims to deliver content to subscribers in rural areas
without cable infrastructure, our regional OTT platform delivers pay-TV services to customers in
metropolitan areas. By expanding our reach beyond the traditional cable footprint using a regional OTT
platform, we are able to increase the number of subscribers to our pay-TV content.


-----

- International OTT. Our NetTV Plus platform, which we launched in 2013, provides over 300 channels in
SD, 73 channels in HD and 265 radio channels, of which more than 250 local language TV channels showing
ethnic content, including all national free-to-air channel offering, to the entire Yugoslav diaspora (estimated
at over 4 million people) around the world through the internet. As of December 31, 2020, we had
106 thousand NetTV Plus subscribers. Subscribers can access our NetTV Plus content through their TVs
using a set-top box connected to the internet, “Smart TVs” that have built in internet functionality or by
streaming content via internet enabled tablets, mobile devices and personal computers. By expanding our
geographic reach outside our region to customers in affluent countries in Western Europe and North
America, we are positioned to charge prices that are higher than the prices we are able to charge for our
pay-TV services in our other markets in Southeastern Europe.

- Forthnet OTT. Our own OTT content platform, which operates under the NOVA brand of products and
services, Novago, Novaflix, Nova on Demand. Our regional OTT platform offers our customers within the
region access to their digital Pay-TV channel offering. As a result, our NOVA subscribers can watch our
digital Pay-TV channels on their TV screens, computers, tablets and mobile devices.

**_Broadband Internet_**

We offer broadband internet in Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Montenegro and Greece.
Beginning in 2009, we upgraded our network to EuroDOCSIS 3.0, and our network is fully EuroDOCSIS 3.0
enabled. Our network offers our customers up to 1.6 Gbps download speeds. We believe that EuroDOCSIS
3.0 is superior to DSL and on par with the FttH services offered by our competitors. We currently provide
internet download speeds that we believe compare favorably to the national average with our average recorded
speeds being faster than that of the respective local incumbent by a factor of 2.7x in Slovenia, 1.5x in Serbia
and 2.9x in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as of April 16, 2021.

As our broadband internet operations provide us with very attractive margins due to little additional cost, we
leverage our attractive pay-TV offering to sell broadband internet services to existing pay-TV customers. As a
result, we do not sell our broadband internet services on a stand-alone basis and customers wishing to receive
our broadband internet services must, at a minimum, subscribe to our analog Basic TV package. As of March 31,
2021, we provided our broadband internet service to approximately 1,396 thousand subscribers across Telemach
Slovenia, SBB Serbia, Telemach BH, Vivacom Bulgaria and Telemach MNE. For the three months ended
March 31, 2021, our broadband internet business generated revenues of €73.9 million and an ARPU of €9.6.

In addition, we offer out-of-footprint internet services (broadband internet services provided through a thirdparty network) across Greece to approximately 528 thousand subscribers through Forthnet as of
December 31, 2020.

Following completion of the Optima Telekom Acquisition, we will offer boardband internet services to
approximately 117 thousand subscribers in Croatia.

_Telemach Slovenia_

Within Slovenia, in a large portion of our cable footprint, our competitors offer DSL services offered by
competitors, and not fiber, enabling us to provide the fastest broadband speed available within those areas.
Our EuroDOCSIS 3.0 enabled network allows us to compete effectively in the remainder of our cable
footprint, which is covered by our competitors’FttH network as it can match speeds offered by FttH operators
in these overbuilt areas. We only offer broadband in Slovenia as part of a double, triple, or quad-play package
with our cable pay-TV subscriptions. We offer our subscribers several for broadband internet service options,
varying in price according to download capacity and speed, and range from a minimum download speed of
50 Mbps to a maximum speed of up to 1,000 Mbps. As of March 31, 2021, Telemach Slovenia provided
broadband internet to approximately 189 thousand subscribers.

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, Telemach Slovenia’s broadband internet business generated
revenues of €11.2 million and an ARPU of €18.2.

According to Fitch Solutions, in 2018, the total broadband market (which includes cable, FttH, DSL and
other subscribers) in Slovenia was estimated at 613 thousand subscribers compared to 189 thousand
subscribers for Telemach Slovenia (including ADSL subscribers) as of March 31, 2021, which we believe
represents significant growth potential in the broadband market in Slovenia.

In 2018, cable-based broadband accounted for 29% of the broadband services in Slovenia based on number
of households, while FttH, DSL and others (which primarily includes wireless, Ethernet, LAD and fixed
wireless access) accounted for 71%. As of December 31, 2020, our total broadband market share in Slovenia


-----

was 31%. Our fixed broadband penetration in Slovenia was 54% as of December 31, 2020 (estimated). As of
December 31, 2020, 96% of our customers in Slovenia received broadband speeds greater than 70 Mbps.

_SBB Serbia_

We are the leading cable broadband internet provider in Serbia with our network, passing approximately
1,137 thousand households across the country as of March 31, 2021. Within Serbia, our subscribers benefit
from our extensive fully two way enabled and EuroDOCSIS 3.0 upgraded network, with our current maximum
commercial offering speed of 1,024/50 Mbps. As of December 31, 2020, the minimum broadband delivery
speed we offer to new customers is 75 Mbps. We believe this compares favorably to the minimum broadband
internet delivery speed offered by our competitors in Serbia.

We offer broadband in Serbia to our existing TV customers and increasingly as part of a multi-play package
with our cable Pay-TV. We offer customers several options of broadband internet services varying in download
capacity and speed at various price points.

As of March 31, 2021, we provided broadband internet to approximately 537 thousand subscribers. For the
three months ended March 31, 2021, SBB Serbia’s broadband internet business generated revenues of
€19.8 million and an ARPU of €10.6.

According to Fitch Solutions, in 2018, the total broadband market (which includes cable, FttH, DSL and
other subscribers) in Serbia was estimated at 1.5 million subscribers compared to 537 thousand subscribers
for SBB Serbia (including ADSL subscribers) as of March 31, 2021, which we believe represents significant
growth potential in the broadband market in Serbia.

In 2018, cable-based broadband accounted for 44% of the broadband services in Serbia based on number of
households, while FttH, DSL and others (which primarily includes wireless, Ethernet, LAD and fixed wireless
access) accounted for 56%. As of December 31, 2020, our total broadband market share in Serbia was 32%.
Our fixed broadband penetration in Serbia was 47% as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, 86%
of our customers in Serbia received broadband speeds greater than 50 Mbps.

_Telemach BH_

Within Bosnia and Herzegovina, our subscribers benefit from our fully two way enabled and EuroDOCSIS
3.0 upgraded network which extends approximately 4,591 kilometers across the country and allows network
broadband internet speeds of up to 400/15 Mbps.

We offer broadband in Bosnia and Herzegovina to our existing TV customers primarily as part of a multiplay package bundled with our digital cable pay-TV. Alternatively, we offer customers several tiers of
broadband internet services with our analog TV service. These internet services are available with various
download capacities and speeds and at varying price points. Higher broadband internet speeds are available
when our internet services are purchased as part of a bundle with our digital pay-TV as compared to the
internet services offered as a bundle with our analog pay-TV. As of March 31, 2021, we provided broadband
internet to approximately 169 thousand subscribers.

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, Telemach BH’s broadband internet business generated revenues
of €5.6 million and an ARPU of €9.5.

According to Fitch Solutions, in 2018, the total broadband market (which includes cable, FttH, DSL and
other subscribers) in Bosnia and Herzegovina was estimated at 694 thousand subscribers compared to
169 thousand subscribers for Telemach BH as of March 31, 2021, which we believe represents significant
growth potential in the broadband market in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

In 2018, cable-based broadband accounted for 33% of the broadband services in Bosnia and Herzegovina
based on number of households, while FttH, DSL and others (which primarily includes wireless, Ethernet,
LAD and fixed wireless access) accounted for 67%. As of December 31, 2020, our total broadband market
share in Bosnia and Herzegovina as of December 31, 2019 was 22%. Our fixed broadband penetration in
Bosnia and Herzegovina was 49% as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, 85% of our customers
in Bosnia and Herzegovina received broadband speeds higher than 30 Mbps. While Bosnia and Herzegovina
is generally not yet making use of high-speed broadband higher than or equal to 30 Mbps, we believe Bosnia
and Herzegovina displays clear trends of acceleration.


-----

_Telemach MNE_

Within Montenegro, our subscribers benefit from a fully two way enabled and EuroDOCSIS 3.0 upgraded
network. We offer cable broadband internet in Montenegro to our existing TV customers primarily as part of
a multi-play package with our digital cable pay-TV.

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, Telemach MNE’s broadband internet business generated
revenues of €0.6 million and an ARPU of €8.3.

_Vivacom_

Vivacom provides an array of fixed broadband services over ADSL, VDSL and FTTx connections to both
residential and business customers in Bulgaria as well as other data services such as the sale of CPEs, VPN
and MAN services and associated complex solutions. All of Vivacom’s offerings include a variety of tariff
plans to suit each subscriber’s usage levels.

Vivacom has focused on the build out of its fiber network in targeted areas, the retention of its current ADSL
subscriber base and migration to VDSL and FTTx and seeks to provide customers with comprehensive after
sales services. Vivacom began its FTTx roll out in 2011 in Sofia and Varna and has since achieved significant
progress, with 1,292 thousand fiber homes passed as of March 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2020, United
Group’s total broadband market share in Bulgaria was 25%.

Vivacom maintains a disciplined approach to expanding its fiber network in carefully selected areas and
adhering to stringent project acceptance criteria. Vivacom believes its low build out costs are attributable to
its ownership of the telecom ducts and the low-cost of labor in Bulgaria, allowing for an attractive return on
investments in fiber. In addition, Vivacom bundles fixed-telephony and fixed broadband services, as its fixed
broadband plan requires a fixed-telephony subscription and includes a free Wi Fi modem.

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, Vivacom’s fixed broadband services generated revenues of
€14.2 million and an ARPU of €5.2. Vivacom had approximately 476 thousand fixed broadband subscribers
as of March 31, 2021.

**_Fixed-line Telephony_**

We offer fixed-line telephony services in Serbia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria and Montenegro.
We intend to leverage on our existing customer base and our extensive network and high-quality pay-TV
content to cross-sell telephony products and bundled products to new and existing customers. Accordingly,
other than in Bulgaria, our fixed-line telephony services are only available to our existing cable pay-TV
customers. Through Forthnet, United Group also offers out-of-footprint telephony services (telephony
provided through a third-party network) across Greece.

According to Fitch Solutions, the total fixed-line telephony market in 2018 was estimated at 665 thousand
subscribers in Slovenia, 2,430 thousand subscribers in Serbia and 740 thousand subscribers in Bosnia and
Herzegovina. Since we had 191 thousand subscribers for Telemach Slovenia, 442 thousand subscribers for
SBB Serbia and 105 thousand subscribers for Telemach BH, each as of March 31, 2021, we believe there is
significant growth potential in such broadband markets. In Bulgaria, the total fixed-line telephony market in
2019 was estimated at 868 thousand subscribers (compared to 514 thousand subscribers for Vivacom as of
March 31, 2021). The total fixed-line telephony market in 2020 was estimated at 4,852 thousand subscribers
in Greece (compared to 536 thousand out-of-footprint subscribers for Forthnet as of March 31, 2021).

Our “Basic Package”in Serbia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro offers free calls within the
Group network and only an analog touchtone phone is required to use our service. In addition to our Basic
Package, we offer our subscribers various other packages, which include free calls to customers of other
regional fixed-line telephony providers. Despite the relatively recent launch of our fixed-line telephony
operations in Serbia, we believe it is the second-largest provider of fixed-line telephony services in Serbia
behind the incumbent Telekom Srbija. We are the largest provider of fixed-line telephony operations in
Bulgaria through Vivacom.

As of March 31, 2021, we provided our fixed-line telephony services to 1,269 thousand subscribers (including
Vivacom). For the three months ended March 31, 2021, our fixed-line telephony services generated revenues
of €29.1 million and an ARPU of €4.3.

**_Mobile-telephony_**

_Telemach Slovenia_

We provide mobile voice, messaging and data to consumers and small businesses on a contract and prepaid
basis, together with an attractive suite of fixed mobile convergence services in Slovenia, which we believe has
contributed to lower churn rates relative to our competitors. Since 2015, we have been the fastest growing
mobile operator in Slovenia following our acquisition of Tušmobil. As a result of consistent growth, as of
December 31, 2020, we hold a 24% market share in the Slovenian mobile market (as compared to 14% at the
end of 2015) and cross-sell mobile services to more than 50% of our fixed-telephony subscriber base. Our
growth over the last five years was largely underpinned by continuous investments in our mobile and fixedtelephony network. In August 2020, we received, for the second year in a row, the “Best in Test” award for
both our mobile and fixed-telephony network by Umlaut (formerly P3 Group), an independent research
agency. According to the Ipsos Brand Tracking Report 2017, our “top of mind” recognition as a mobile
provider in Slovenia was 21% in 2017, but by September 2020, it had increased to 30%. Similarly, after the
integration of Tušmobil, a higher percentage of customers chose Telemach Slovenia as their first choice for
mobile products in Slovenia, while our primary competitors have experienced decreases or stagnation in this
metric during the same period from 2017 to 2020. The following chart shows the evolution of customers’ first
choice of brand:

Our mobile network provides coverage to almost all of Slovenia’s population through our extensive 2G/
3G/4G and as of June 2021 5G networks. Licenses for use of spectrum for 2G are valid through 2031, while
spectrum for 3G is valid through 2021 (5 MHz on the 2100 band), 2023 (another 5 MHz on the 2100 band)
and 2031 (5 MHz on the 900 band). In 2016, Telemach acquired additional spectrum in the 1800 MHz and
2100 MHz bands. This acquired spectrum allowed United Group to expand our 3G and 4G networks. Use of
frequencies in the LTE network currently includes 2x10 MHz in the 800 MHz spectrum band and 2x10 MHz
in 1800 MHz spectrum band (which is the key spectrum band used for LTE services). These licenses are valid
through 2029 (800 MHz) and 2031 (1800 MHz). We are capable of providing 4G (LTE) coverage to
approximately 99% of the Slovenian population and 4G+ (LTE-A) coverage to approximately 98% of the
Slovenian population. In addition, we have successfully tested and are rolling out next generation 5G networks
across our mobile-telephony footprint. In April 2021, Telemach Slovenia secured 15-year spectrum licenses in
Slovenia for 5G frequencies, and commenced deployment and commercial launch of 5G 3600 MHz in
Slovenia in June 2021.

As of March 31, 2021, we had 596 thousand subscribers for our post-paid and prepaid mobile services. During
each month of the first three months of 2021, Telemach Slovenia achieved 34% of gross additions in the
mobile market, as compared to 32% during each month of 2020 and 31% during each month of 2019. Our
principal focus is post-paid subscribers, who generate significantly higher ARPU and generally have lower


-----

churn rates than prepaid subscribers, and as of March 31, 2021, contract subscribers accounted for 83% of
our subscriber base. According to Fitch Solutions, in 2018, the total mobile-telephony market in Slovenia was
estimated at 2.5 million subscribers compared to 596 thousand subscribers for Telemach Slovenia as of
March 31, 2021, which we believe represents significant growth potential in the mobile-telephony market in
Slovenia.

In April 2017, we updated our mobile packages, with more data, more calls and more text messaging, and
introduced our UNIFI Travel Wi Fi roaming application, providing access to more than 70 million Wi Fi
hotspots around the world. All products include free on net calls with unlimited off net national calls in
medium and high end packages, and with the introduction of new EU roaming regulations which took effect
on June 15, 2017, customers can now utilize their text message and voice minute allotments across the EU
with no roaming charges.

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, Telemach Slovenia’s mobile-telephony services generated
revenues of €21.3 million and an ARPU of €10.9.

_Telemach Croatia_

We provide mobile-telephony services in Croatia through Telemach Croatia, the third largest
telecommunications operator in Croatia based on mobile revenues as of December 31, 2020, after Croatian
Telekom and A1. In the post-paid mobile segment, Telemach Croatia seeks to offer the best value proposition
in the Croatian mobile market, for example through its offering of unlimited mobile services.

Telemach Croatia has an extensive 2G/3G/4G mobile network covering all major cities and important roads
in Croatia. In February and March 2019, Telemach Croatia acquired 2100 MHz and 2600 MHz frequencies,
enhancing spectrum capacity. Telemach Croatia is participating in a 5G spectrum auction in Croatia this year.

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, our mobile-telephony services in Croatia generated revenues of
€32.2 million and an ARPU of €12.1.

_Vivacom_

Vivacom is among the market leaders in offering mobile services in Bulgaria. Vivacom offers mobile voice
and data services and products over GSM/GPRS/EDGE and UMTS/HSPA+/LTE networks, on either a
post-paid or pre-paid basis, through multiple volume based and flat rate offerings, each with multiple tariff
options, and we believe that Vivacom’s mobile post-paid offerings are some of the most comprehensive in the
Bulgarian telecommunications market. Vivacom offers other mobile services and products, including the sale
of mobile handsets and accessories. Such services include unlimited mobile data, roaming voice and mobile
data packages (within the European Union or within neighboring countries), SMS and MMS and
international calls to both fixed and mobile lines. In all of its post-paid tariffs, Vivacom bundles mobile TV
services under the TV GO brand with over 90 channels, as well as music streaming (Tidal) and cloud storage
with mobile subscriptions. In addition, all of Vivacom’s customers have access to a digital wallet (Pay by
VIVACOM) that is currently free of charge. On September 21, 2020, we announced the commercial launch of
our 5G network in Bulgaria, and to that end in May 2021, we secured a 20-year license for 100 MHz spectrum
frequencies in the 3.6 GHz band.

Vivacom is also a leading provider of a full suite of telecommunications solutions for the corporate segment,
with a portfolio of services suitable for all business sizes. All business mobile plans include national and
international minutes, mobile data and a range of other features that support companies in running their
businesses. For large business customers, the approach is to offer customized services tailored to their specific
needs. For small and medium sized companies, we offer more standardized products, such as all-inclusive
tariff plans that have a set amount of minutes (national and international) and data for a fixed monthly fee.

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, Vivacom’s mobile operations generated revenues of €64.0 million,
representing 49% of its total revenue in the same period. Vivacom had approximately 3.0 million mobile
subscribers as of March 31, 2021, of which approximately 88% were post-paid subscribers and approximately
12% were pre-paid subscribers. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, blended mobile ARPU was €7.3.

**_United Media_**

Through focused and consistent investment over the last few years, and by a combination of our investment in
developing owned pay-TV content and in entering into strategic partnerships with regional and international


-----

third-party content owners, we have built a comprehensive content offering, covering sports, movies, news
and children’s content.

_Owned Content Business_

Through our owned-content business we directly own many of the region’s popular pay-TV channels. In 2006,
we acquired Sport Klub, the most popular sports channels in the region, and in 2012, we added Cinemania, a
popular movie channel, to our content portfolio. We strive to continually improve these offerings. For example,
in collaboration with notable studios in the United States, we have improved Cinemania’s movie content helping
to establish Cinemania as a leading movie channel in the region. We have also continued to improve the content
we offer through our leading Sport Klub channel by adding popular sporting events to its content portfolio. We
have introduced localized feeds for Sport Klub channels, in both HD and SD. Furthermore, we organize and
produce eSports events, which we broadcasts via Fortuna eSports. In April 2017, we acquired Fight Channel, a
Croatian channel with premium content focused on Ultimate Fighting Championship, and IDJ Digital Holding
Limited, a digital distributor of music and online video content in Malta.

In 2014, we launched N1, an independent 24/7 regional news channel affiliated with CNN, with studios in
Belgrade, Zagreb and Sarajevo and a large network of reporters and journalists reporting on regional events,
and which is now available to subscribers in all of United Group’s geographic markets. In addition, we have
sold distribution rights for this channel to all major operators in the region. In 2020, we signed an exclusive
partnership with NewsMax International and launched NewsMax Adria, a 24/7 cable news channel. Since
the beginning of 2015, we have utilized our majority stake in Grand Production, a leading Serbian music and
TV production house with a long history of broadcasting popular shows in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina
and North Macedonia (formerly Macedonia) to introduce a 24/7 local music and entertainment channel
called Grand. In 2016, we launched the Grand 2 channel, expanding our music channels portfolio with new
content offered to our subscribers. In March 2021, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 49% of
Grand Production.

We have also been successful in broadening the distribution reach of our other pay-TV channels. For example,
during 2015, we sold distribution rights for N1 and certain Grand Production channels to other major cable
operators in the region. We have extended the distribution scope for Orlando Kids and Bambino (which have
been rebranded as Pikaboo and Vavoom, respectively), popular channels geared towards children that
complement our Ultra family of pay-TV channels, to include Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia,
Montenegro and Serbia, as well as Croatia and Slovenia, where those offerings were already present. We have
also increased revenues from our Sport Klub channels by successfully extending our existing contracts with
third-party pay-TV distributors while maintaining access to premium content. We have also extended the
production of the most popular entertainment shows for national TV stations in Serbia, Bosnia and
Herzegovina, Croatia, and North Macedonia, such as Your Face Sounds Familiar, Grand Stars, Never too
Late and Practical Woman, which became among the most watched shows in their respective markets.

In July 2018, we acquired Nova Croatia that features several popular television channels in Croatia. We believe
this acquisition will help us to create a strong mainstream media platform that will further differentiate our
distribution platform, promote our pay-TV channel portfolio, drive continued growth and create a strong
platform for additional bolt-on, accretive acquisitions.

In September 2018, we acquired Direct Media, a leading media-buying agency in Serbia, enabling us to deliver
targeted solutions to advertisers, for both television (national and pay-TV) and digital, product placements
and sponsorships. The transaction included Direct Media’s operations in Serbia, Montenegro, North
Macedonia (formerly Macedonia) and Albania, as well as the company’s terrestrial TV stations Pink BiH and
Pink Montenegro. In October 2018, we rebranded these channels as Nova BH and Nova M, respectively, to
facilitate synergies with the existing brand equity of Nova in Croatia.

In March 2019, we launched Nova S in Serbia, a channel fully exclusive to our SBB Serbia, Total TV and
EON platforms. Nova S offers high-quality, locally produced series as well as sports and talk shows. Recently,
we have significantly increased viewership in most of our channels, particularly Nova S, which has become
one of the most popular TV channels in Serbia.

In January 2021, we acquired Nova Broadcasting Group, Bulgaria’s largest multi-platform media company,
which operates 10 television channels, including Nova TV, and Bulgaria’s largest online platform. Forthnet
also produces its own media and content for the Greek market.

We believe that the attractiveness of our content platform across key pay-TV genres supports the sustainable
leadership position of our distribution platform. While a significant part of our content business’s revenue


-----

consists of carriage fees charged to our own distribution platforms (Telemach Slovenia, SBB Serbia, Telemach
BH and Total TV), we also generate revenues through carriage fees paid by third-party distribution platforms,
such as Telekom Slovenije, Hrvatski Telekom, T2 and A1 (formerly Si.Mobil), sales of advertising and the
sublicensing of some of the sports rights we acquire to regional free-to-air broadcasters or to TV operators in
Kosovo, where the Group does not have any operations.

Our Sport Klub sports TV channels are by far the most in-demand channels of its content business, followed
by N1 and Nova S.

The following table sets forth the main sports broadcasting rights United Group held through its TV channels
as at December 31, 2020. United Group has historically been successful in renewing these contracts on
comparable terms.

We secured regional rights for certain other major football and basketball competitions, including qualifiers

-----

The variety that we offer in our content business allows us to tailor our approach for each individual country
and market in which we operate. We plan to continue to review our content offering and will continue to
develop our own distinctive content. We continue to view content differentiation as the cornerstone of our
strategy and to drive the attractiveness of our content offerings relative to those of our competitors.

_Third-party Content_

In addition to our owned content offerings, our pay-TV distribution platforms typically license the rights for
the distribution of our channels, as well as third-party owned channels, typically for a period of three to
five years.

As the prominent pan-regional operator, we have been able to negotiate contracts with third-party providers
that we believe are beneficial. For example, we have been able to lock in flat-rate contracts for content that
provide for terms spanning multiple years, which benefits our profit margins as our number of subscribers
increases because we are able to retain the benefits of increases in our subscriber base, and thereby increase
our margins. We also pay royalties based on our subscribers’ usage of our VoD content. We generally pay such
license fees on a “per subscriber”basis. For on-demand content purchased by subscribers (transactional VoD),
we generally pay a revenue share of the retail price. For packaged on-demand content, we pay on a “persubscriber”basis (subscription VoD), often subject to fixed minimum guarantees. If necessary, we also license
third-party copyrights through various collective rights associations. We generally seek to negotiate fixed-fee
contracts and attempt to move away from per- subscriber agreements. We expect that our content costs (above
the minimum amounts) will generally increase in line with increased revenues from digital pay-TV and ondemand content and continued investment in high-quality content to differentiate our platform from our
competitors. We negotiate our contracts for content and other third-party rights on a Group-wide basis, so
that we are able to maximize the benefits of our scale and best practices across the Group, and we have
historically been successful at renewing these contracts on comparable terms. We plan to acquire additional
broadcasting rights in the future to further enhance our content offering.

**_Wi Fi_**

Since 2011, we have been expanding our Wi Fi hotspot service in Serbia, Slovenia, and Bosnia and
Herzegovina, and the service is currently offered under our UNIFI brand. To increase our brand recognition,
we currently offer the service for free, and we believe that this product is steadily gaining significant popularity.
We intend to utilize UNIFI to complement our bundled offering and reduce customer churn as well as to


-----

incentivize the use of our products by potentially offering UNIFI free to only our subscribers. Moreover, we
believe this service offers further monetization potential from users that are not our customers.

In 2017, SBB Serbia and Telemach Slovenia launched UNIFI Travel, a Wi Fi service which is available in
120 countries, through more than 70 million hotspots. Telemach BH launched the same Wi Fi service in 2019.

**_Multi-Play Services_**

One of our primary areas of focus is to provide bundled services, which consist of a package of two or more
of the following services: pay-TV, broadband internet services, fixed-line telephony and mobile-telephony.
This enables our customers to subscribe to these services in a convenient “one stop shop”manner at attractive
prices that are lower when bundled than the sum of the stand-alone services of similar value. We believe that
the several bundled options we have introduced allow our customers to tailor their packages according to
their requirements and offer them greater value for money compared to similar services offered by our
competitors. As of March 31, 2021, approximately 81% of our cable customers subscribed to our multi-play
packages. In Bulgaria, Vivacom also offers multi-play service bundles and as of March 31, 2021, approximately
48% of Vivacom’s customers in Bulgaria are subscribed to a multi-play package. Our multi-play packages
have allowed us to increase our total RGUs for cable-based services to approximately 10.6 million RGUs as of
March 31, 2021.

Our straightforward and unified triple-play offering, which includes pay television, broadband internet
services and fixed-line telephony, accounts for a significant percentage of our total new sales, comprising 89%
of our gross additions in Slovenia, 60% of our gross additions in Serbia, and 24% of our gross additions in
Bosnia and Herzegovina, in each case for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Our best-selling triple-play
packages (each based on the number of triple-play gross additions in the first three months of 2021) are: EON
Light in Slovenia (accounting for 62% of triple-play gross additions in Slovenia); EON Full in Serbia
(accounting for 47% of triple-play gross additions in Serbia); and EON Light in Bosnia and Herzegovina
(accounting for 53% of triple-play gross additions in Bosnia and Herzegovina). We have upgraded our tripleplay offering consistently for both new and existing customers, which has allowed us to raise prices over time.
The following chart compares our triple-play packages in Slovenia, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina at the
time of launch to the offerings as of March 31, 2021 with green colored fields indicating areas where our triple
play package has offered increased value to customers since launch:

**Business Product Offerings**

We utilize our existing fixed-line network in Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro to
offer a range of business products including virtual private networks, Wi Fi hotspots, managed services and
network capacity leases to telecommunications operators, financial institutions, public service customers and
multinational companies. We are the first CISCO certified partner for B2B services in the region, and we aim


-----

to continually improve the service portfolio of our business products by providing innovative and high-quality
solutions along with dedicated customer care. We offer tailor made solutions for modern businesses across
various industry segments, as well as to carrier clients.

One of our key customers in the region is Telekom Austria. We provide network connection services for
Telekom Austria’s mobile phone towers as well as ‘last mile’ connection services for Telekom Austria’s B2B
clients. Other key international partners include Romtelecom, Tele2, Telia Company, Pantel Technologies,
Inteliquent, Interoute, Level 3 and PCCW.

**Subscribers**

We sell our TV, broadband internet and fixed-line and mobile-telephony services, either on an individual
service subscription basis or on a bundled basis, to residential customers and business customers. Our basic
pay-TV subscription serves as a basis for cross-selling and up selling and, with the exception of subscribers in
Slovenia who generally prefer to subscribe only to our mobile-telephony service, every subscriber needs at
least a subscription for our basic pay-TV package to have access to our other services. Consumer subscriptions
account for most of our revenues. Within the consumer market, we market our services directly to subscribers
in single dwelling units and multi-dwelling units, such as apartment buildings. We provide our services
pursuant to standard form fixed contracts lasting for 12 or 24 months.

Our business subscribers typically purchase our broadband internet and voice and other data services, and we
generally target small to mid-size businesses in metropolitan regions. Business subscriber contracts usually
extend over a period of 24 months and cannot be prematurely cancelled free of charge.

We believe that we have a loyal customer base, which is the result of low churn rates due to our high-quality
content, extensive network coverage and high-quality customer service.

Additionally, as our network covers the most affluent regions in Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Montenegro, Croatia (following the completion of the Tele2 Croatia Acquisition), Bulgaria (following the
completion of the Vivacom Acquisition) and Greece (following completion of the Forthnet Acquisition), our
business benefits from low rates of services termination due to customers’ inability to pay.

**Innovation**

United.Cloud is our technology innovation and software development center which we established in 2016
with offices in Serbia and Slovenia. The centralization of our research and development team within
United.Cloud provides a significant improvement in time to market for our quality and innovative products,
with a high degree of customization and flexibility to ensure new product launches are in line with our
corporate strategy. We can create unified multi-service solutions to apply across all our markets, such as EON,
with the ability to enter new markets quickly due to technological autonomy without a need to rely on outside
developers, and our customers benefit from an improved user experience across our products. We regularly
introduce new products and continue to develop our existing technology. Starting with D3 GO as a multiscreen
option included in packages, we have added additional features such as UNIFON, UNIFI and UNIFI Travel.
Our continuous focus on product innovation has led to a strong track record of in-house development, as
shown in the following chart.

We also continue to invest in our network infrastructure. For example, Slovenia is a GIGA country. Novi Sad,
Subotica and Gornji Milanovac in Serbia are GIGA cities, while our plans for Belgrade are nearly complete,
with Kragujevac in Serbia planned to be next. Sarajevo in Bosnia and Herzegovina is planned to be a GIGA
city in 2021.

**_EON_**

EON is our next generation video delivery platform that allows customers to watch their favorite channels on
a range of devices, including set-top boxes smartphones, tablets, laptops, and Smart TVs, with the ability to
seamlessly “hand off” and resume watching from one device to the next. EON is the first platform in the
region to allow viewers to watch TV through an application on a Smart TV. In establishing EON, which
developed out of the prior D3 platform, we have prioritized user customization, through the introduction of
user inputs such as reminders, favorites and search functions. The home screen includes editorial content
within a modern and intuitive user interface. The VoD component is extensive, with a CatchUp feature
allowing viewers to access content broadcasted within the previous seven days, totaling over 15 thousand
hours of content available at any given time. EON gives users access to over 502 TV channels, 163 radio
channels, and more than 25,000 VoD assets. We have also ensured that EON utilizes the latest media
encryption technology in order to protect against digital piracy. We have an additional stream of game
changing updates to be introduced to EON over the next two years, including cloud DVR, “download to go”
and improved connectivity with third-party devices and services. Our partnership with Google will help us
release the 4K Ultra HD set-top box, which will fully integrate Google platforms such as YouTube and Google
Play Store.

**_Digital Platform_**

Our digital platform provides a sustainable channel to future proof our platforms and to address evolving
customer habits around access to media, digital content and advertising consumption.

_Telecommunications_

Our digital platform is an important element of our user experience, and we have recently focused on
innovations in our self-help platform, web portals and e-commerce. Our self-help platform allows users to
personalize their dashboards and access offers, pay their bills and receive assistance. We also utilize our web
portals as a central hub for all marketing activity and offer access to support services and the ability to order
products online.

_Media_

We have grown our media content offerings on our digital platform. Our most successful digital media
offerings are regional news and sport portals N1 and Sport Klub, as well as DNEVNIK.hr in Croatia and


-----

Nova.rs in Serbia. N1 is a fully independent, stand-alone platform with automated content exchange. During
the first three months of 2021, N1 had over 140 million page views, an increase of 9.5% compared to the same
period in 2020, and over 20.6 million unique users (an increase of 29%) who spent approximately 2 minutes on
average on the platform. In the same period, N1 recorded more than 41.8 million screen views on its mobile
application. Our regional sports news platform, Sport Klub, is split across three separate web portals and a
dedicated mobile application for iOS and Android. In the three months ended March 31, 2021, Sport Klub
had over 4.2 million users, an increase of 29% compared to the same period in 2020, more than 20.8 million
page views and over 7.8 million screen views on mobile devices.

Launched on February 29, 2020, Nova.rs in Serbia is the latest portal in our portfolio. In a few months, it
became one of the most influential portals in Serbia. As of March 31, 2021, the portal had 13.4 million users,
151.4 million page views and 71 million screen views on the application. In Croatia, our portal DNEVNIK.hr,
with approximately 2,078 thousand real users in March 2021, an increase of 5% compared to the same period
in 2020, is the most visited web portal in Croatia, according to Gemius ratings.

**_E-commerce_**

In July 2020, we leveraged our position in both the broadband and pay-TV markets to launch Shoppster, our
regional e-commerce online-shopping platform, which will initially offer more than 20 popular product
categories, including electronics, home and gardening, tools, fashion, items for children and kitchen
appliances. Shoppster is available as an integrated online and TV shopping platform in Serbia and Slovenia.
In Serbia, Shoppster operates as a marketplace using the dropshipping operating model, whereby it does not
stock the products it sells. In Slovenia, Shoppster operates as a retailer as a result of an acquisition that we
have completed and stores the products it sells in a leased warehouse. Products sold though Shoppster are
distributed by third-party delivery couriers in both Serbia and Slovenia. Shoppster is a unique offering which
combines the convenience of online-shopping with the audience engagement of television. Products will be
presented and available for sale on the Shoppster TV channel, which will be devoted to home-shopping.
Popular TV personalities from Southeastern Europe will present offers and products from the many
companies that have joined Shoppster. We intend for Shoppster to deliver the simple, reliable and secure
e-shopping experience that modern consumers expect.

**Customer Services**

Along with content differentiation, customer service is a key pillar of our offering, and we believe that we
offer subscribers high-quality customer service that is in line with Western European standards. Our customer
service operations are responsible for all customer care activities, including technical support as well as
handling queries and complaints from our customers. We operate dedicated customer contact centers in
Ljubljana, Belgrade, Sarajevo, Podgorica, Sofia and Pleven. As of March 31, 2021, our customer service team
employed approximately 837 employees (793 full-time equivalent). Vivacom also provides an additional service
to high-value business customers who require proactive technical support. In addition to call center services,
customers also have at their disposal a variety of self-service channels, such as an interactive voice response
system, Unstructured Supplementary Service Data on Vivacom’s mobile network and the My Vivacom
application, which was launched in 2018, and provides customers with 24/7 access to information about their
services, customer data and current consumption, and notifications as to billing information. Forthnet also
provides customer services to its customers in Greece.

All customer service agents are regularly trained in soft skills and educated on new product offerings and
advertising campaigns. As is common in Western Europe, we constantly measure our team’s response times
and offer our subscribers the option to provide feedback on our service immediately following the call.
Additionally, we have a customer service team focusing on business retention, which reaches out to existing
subscribers prior to the expiration of such subscribers’ service contracts to extend the service contract and
advertise our products through various initiatives, including, for example, Vivacom’s provision of mobile
handset and tablet subsidies in order to grow its mobile subscriber base and complimentary installations for
certain business customers. We also have a specialized team for sales and customer care in relation to our
business services.

We believe our customer service representatives are trained in accordance with Western European customer
service standards, and we receive consistently high scores in our subscriber satisfaction surveys.

**Marketing and Sales**

Our marketing, sales and customer care department is responsible for designing and promoting new products
and services to customers, as well as building a high-quality customer experience throughout the entire “life


-----

cycle” of a customer relationship. In this regard, we are able to leverage our owned content channels to cross
promote our other products and services to our customers, because we can advertise those other products and
services on our channels. We also market and sell our products using a broad range of sales outlets, including
through our leased retail stores which are located in attractive parts of town in our key regions and markets,
including in Ljubljana, Belgrade, Sarajevo and Sofia, third-party stores, telesales and our partners’ websites.
As of March 31, 2021, our marketing, sales and customer care teams comprised 5,070 employees (4,555
full-time equivalent).

To strengthen our brand recognition, we have entered into a number of sponsorship agreements with local,
regional and national sports associations. Additionally, we give donations to social institutions, such as youth
organizations, across the region.

Vivacom works to provide a consistent image as a provider of “best in class”services and customer experience
and high-quality subscriber experience in the key areas that subscribers value. Vivacom markets its products
primarily through focused television advertising, with billboards, press, radio and the internet as additional
advertising outlets. Vivacom sells services and products through direct channels, such as Vivacom owned
stores and indirect channels and a smaller number of third-party retail distributors. Its distribution network is
further supported by remote channels such as e-commerce platforms. To strengthen its brand image, Vivacom
partners with well-known mobile handset brands, and in 2020, Vivacom launched its official partnership with
Apple.

**Network**

We employ a variety of network technologies to deliver our products and services to our customers, and the
following chart provides an overview of our network technologies as well as the markets in which such network
technologies are currently deployed. Approximately 92% of our core network to be DOCSIS 3.1 was ready by

the Middle East and Africa. Our cable network covers approximately 3.7 million homes passed as of March 31,
2021 and generally covers the most affluent areas in our key markets. Specifically, as of March 31, 2021, our
network passed approximately 350 thousand homes, or approximately 47% of all households, in Slovenia,
1,137 thousand homes, or approximately 47% of all households, in Serbia, 344 thousand homes, or
approximately 30% of all households, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, 97 thousand homes, or approximately 49%
of all households, in Montenegro and 1,797 thousand homes, or approximately 63% of all households, in
Bulgaria.

Our network generally offers better capacity, speed and quality advantages compared to copper-based DSL
networks. In particular, an HFC cable network offers larger bandwidth than ordinary copper cable and, unlike
the latter, it is not significantly affected by attenuation (a reduction in the strength of the signal) or distortion
(reduction in quality of the signal) when the signal is carried over a long distance. We also offer significantly
more bandwidth capacity than the average broadband customer uses. While broadband data consumption
has increased across Slovenia (from 48 Gbps in 2015 to 311 Gbps in the year ended December 31, 2020),
Serbia (from 97 Gbps in 2015 to 800Gbps in the year ended December 31, 2020), and Bosnia and Herzegovina
(from 45 Gbps in 2015 to 238 Gbps in the year ended December 31, 2020), installed capacity is higher than the
average used capacity by a significant margin, as shown in the charts below.

Q1

Our HFC network is fully bi-directional in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina and approximately 98% of
HFC homes passed in Slovenia are bi-directional as of March 31, 2021. Our bi-directional network enables us
to deliver broadband internet, fixed-line telephony, and other interactive services such as VoD, to our
customers throughout our cable network, in addition to regular digital and analog television services.

Our cable network is EuroDOCSIS 3.0 enabled, covering our cable broadband internet RGUs in Slovenia,
Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, enabling which allows us to offer theoretical maximum speed levels of up
to 1,600 Mbps with 32 allocated frequency channels. In Montenegro, we continue to upgrade the network to
Group standards following our acquisitions. We believe we offer one of the highest available speeds in our
cable footprint, ranging between 100-1,000 Mbps. We also have industry leading node density. A lower node
density mitigates the risk of network congestion and related reductions in quality of service. As of March 31,
2021, Telemach Slovenia had a node density of 1,178, Telemach BH of 1,482 and SBB Serbia of 5,212.

As of March 31, 2021, our HFC network has homes passed per fiber optics node ratios of approximately
257:1 in Slovenia, approximately 208:1 in Serbia, approximately 228:1 in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and
approximately 126:1 in Montenegro, which we believe is unrivalled in Southeastern Europe and compares
favorably to Central and Eastern European cable benchmarks. This means our fiber optic nodes typically only
extend a very short distance from subscribers’ homes and offices, with only the last few hundred meters
connected through coaxial cables. This allows us to provide high broadband internet access speeds and
advanced services to subscribers.

We operate one of the most extensive backbone networks across the region with a national backbone
consisting of approximately 21,236 kilometers (as of March 31, 2021, including Vivacom and Forthnet) owned
and leased dense wavelength division multiplexing fiber links that extend across Southeastern Europe with


-----

international optical interconnections to Vienna, Frankfurt, Amsterdam and London. Such extensive fiber
rich backbone not only supports our HFC cable network but also makes us a partner of choice for regional
telecoms and other business customers. e rent ducts and poles from third-parties as a part of our network.

FttH is our technology of choice for greenfield expansion and new buildings in adjacent areas. As of
March 31, 2021, we passed 950 thousand homes with FttH and had 216 thousand active users across Serbia,
Slovenia, Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro. In addition to FttH greenfield expansion,
during the third quarter of 2018, we introduced Gigabit speeds in areas where digitalization of analog TV
signals was completed.

We complement our cable network with DTH and mobile offerings. We contract for satellite services with
EUTELSAT, which transmits our satellite programming over their satellite networks to our customers. Data
streams are sent to satellites that transmit the signal to local satellite receivers. Our transponder allotment
agreements with EUTELSAT are valid until December 31, 2024. Pursuant to a services agreement entered
into with EUTELSAT in December 2014, SBB Serbia agreed to replace all our subscriber reception boxes in
order to permit the reception of HD and MPEG 4 transmissions to our subscribers via the transponders
currently allocated to SBB Serbia on the EUTELSAT 16A satellite. The replacement of such subscriber
reception boxes affected approximately 340,000 households. EUTELSAT agreed to assist SBB Serbia in the
replacement of such equipment in order to facilitate migration to MPEG 4 technology from MPEG 2
technology. The installation of the equipment commenced in February 2015 and has since been completed.
Subject to certain milestones being met, EUTELSAT has agreed to participate in the costs incurred by SBB
Serbia in connection with the replacement of the equipment. Furthermore, EUTELSAT has also agreed to
provide SBB Serbia with certain discounts and also provide a certain amount of free additional satellite
capacity from the MPEG 4 launch date until 2024.

Vivacom

We believe that Vivacom’s fixed-line network is the largest in Bulgaria, and comprises an extensive copper
infrastructure and a fiber network that passes 1,292 thousand FTTx homes and 505 thousand VDSL homes
as of March 31, 2021. This network provides for a fully digitalized fixed-telephony services and ADSL, VDSL
and fiber services that offer commercially available speeds of up to 20 Mbps, 50 Mbps and 1,000 Mbps,
respectively. Vivacom also has a fully owned fiber backbone network that includes a Dense Wavelength
Division Multiplexing fiber network that allows for easy capacity extension and is able to route all backbone
traffic via this infrastructure.

Vivacom began its FTTx roll out in 2011 in Sofia and Varna and has since achieved significant progress from
402 thousand fiber homes passed in 2012 to 1,292 thousand fiber homes passed with a 27% take-up rate as of
March 31, 2021. Vivacom’s fiber build out was performed in carefully selected areas based on specific return
on investment criteria. We believe that Vivacom incurs low build out costs allowing for a higher return on
investment in fiber, due to ownership of the ducts and the low-cost of labor in Bulgaria. Vivacom’s FTTx
build out consists of a mix of FTTB and FTTH technology. The technology that is ultimately implemented
depends on economics and density of the area.

In addition, Vivacom owns and operates one of the biggest and most modern facilities for satellite
communications in the region—Plana Teleport, which is able to deliver transmission and connectivity even to
very remote points, including orbital positions in Europe, Africa, Middle East and Asia. Since 2014, Plana
Teleport is a member of the World Teleport Association and in 2017 achieved full Tier 3 certification, making
it among the most modern facilities of its kind.

Software is incorporated into virtually every element of Vivacom’s network. Apart from operations and
maintenance software provided by equipment vendors, Vivacom also has a range of specialized tools for
network planning. Vivacom is in the process of implementing industry standardized IT solutions rather than
customized solutions for key systems.

Vivacom provides satellite services, including uplink and downlink of radio and TV channels, playout
solutions, fixed and mobile VSAT data connectivity, collocation of satellite equipment and other services. In
addition, Vivacom is a third-party teleport of EUTELSAT and also partners with Intelsat, SES, Gazprom,
Azercosmos and Hellas Sat. Vivacom has a license for the provision of satellite services.

Vivacom’s satellite services offering includes video uplink services on various satellites, Playout Solution as a
Service (PSS), a cloud based service including playout hardware located at Vivacom technical facilities and an
IP based tool for content management, VSAT data links, which use the latest DVB S2x technology ensuring
higher data rates, optimized cost for the customer, better flexibility and reliability, and are mainly targeted at


-----

the maritime business, as well as fixed VSAT links for corporate networks, in rural areas and as a backup
solution and satellite collocation services.

Vivacom also operates a microwave IP based network connecting main sites in Bulgaria. Vivacom uses a
microwave network for delivery of DTT signal and Bulgarian national radio channels to the main TV towers.
The microwave network is monitored and controlled 24/7 by the National Operations Center.

Forthnet

Forthnet operates and maintains a fiber optic network extending 5,927 kilometers across Greece that provides
its site interconnection and backbone capacities. The services provided by Forthnet are based mainly on
xDSL technologies, and Forthnet also holds a regulated local loop unbundling agreement with the incumbent
telecommunications provider in Greece. As of March 31, 2021, Forthnet was able to serve 82% (93% in NGA
eligible fixed lines) of the Greek population through its colocations in local exchanges and interconnections
with wholesale providers.

_Mobile_

Telemach Slovenia commenced a modernization program for Tušmobil’s mobile network immediately after
its acquisition in April 2015. Within four months of the acquisition, the radio network on 560 mobile sites
was modernized with a swap of complete 2G and 3G technology. Additionally, a 4G network was implemented
alongside the existing network and prepared for a commercial launch in June 2015. By the end of 2015, the
modernization of the microwave transport network was completed.

Our mobile network in Slovenia is fully IP enabled, with SRAN (single radio access network technology)
providing full services on 2G, 3G and 4G networks.

We currently provide 4G (LTE) and 4G+ (LTE-A) coverage to approximately 99% and 97%, respectively, of
the Slovenian population. In 2020, we added 54 additional mobile sites to our footprint. In 2021, Telemach
Slovenia expects to launch a total of 55 new sites, which we expect will lead to 4G (LTE) and 4G+ (LTE-A)
coverage for approximately 99% of the Slovenian population. The technology upgrades and new sites are
expected to increase Telemach Slovenia’s coverage, amplify our network capacity and enhance customer
experience. In April 2021, Telemach Slovenia secured 15-year spectrum licenses in Slovenia for 5G frequency
bands and commenced commercial deployment of 5G in Slovenia in June 2021.

Telemach Croatia, having successfully launched its 4G service, covers all major cities and important roads in
Croatia. Telemach Croatia has also acquired 2100MHz and 2600MHz frequencies to support spectrum
capacity. Telemach Croatia is participating in a 5G spectrum auction in Croatia this year.

Vivacom

Vivacom offers mobile services through its integrated 2G, 3G and 4G/LTE network. In 2018, Vivacom
launched a 4G voice service (Voice over LTE) and Wi Fi calling services, which enable Vivacom’s customers to
benefit from high definition voice services. On September 21, 2020, Vivacom announced the commercial
launch of its 5G network in Bulgaria, and to that end in May 2021, Vivacom secured a 20-year license for 100
MHz spectrum frequencies in the 3.6 GHz band. To scale the development of its 5G network quickly, Vivacom
uses dynamic spectrum sharing on its existing 4G network, enabling it to provide 5G coverage to all 27 district
cities in Bulgaria. Other than its 5G network, Vivacom’s network is based on: GSM/EDGE (2G technologies),
UMTS/HSPA+ (3G technologies) and LTE/LTE-Advanced (4G/4.5G technologies).

As of March 31, 2021, Vivacom’s GSM mobile network covered 99.99% of the Bulgarian population, its
UMTS mobile network covered 99.99% of the Bulgarian population, and its LTE network covered 99.94% of
the Bulgarian population. Vivacom’s licenses allow it to use 2x11.2 MHz on the 900 MHz spectrum band,
2x15MHz on the 1800 MHz spectrum band and 2x15MHz on the 2100 MHz spectrum band.

As of March 31, 2021, Vivacom’s mobile network is supported by a portfolio of 3,675 tower sites across
Bulgaria, of which 42% have fiber backhauling.

Vivacom covers over 681 networks by roaming agreements with other Bulgarian and international operators
around the world as of March 31, 2021.

Mobile Network Evolution

During 2021, we entered into two global framework agreements for the provision of equipment and services
for our mobile networks in Bulgaria, Croatia and Slovenia that are material to the evolution and upkeep of
our mobile networks, including commercial implementation of next generation 5G capabilities.


-----

- Mobile Radio Network Equipment Agreement

We entered into a global frame agreement with Huawei International Co. Limited (“Huawei”) for the supply
of radio network equipment for our mobile networks, which was effective as of April 16, 2021. The duration
of the contract is 5 years, subject to renewal and extension. Pursuant to the terms of the contract, we agreed
to purchase, and with the assistance of Huawei install and operate, certain radio equipment, receive spare
parts, reuse certain legacy equipment and use or license certain other items from Huawei upon certain agreed

existing work with Huawei, which we believe we have at all times conducted in compliance with relevant laws
and regulations.

- Mobile Core Network Elements Agreement

As part of a strategy to consolidate our core network vendors, we also entered into a global frame agreement
with Nokia Solutions and Networks Oy as of June 17, 2021, for the supply, installation, commissioning,
migration, support and network evolution of mobile core network elements for our mobile networks. The
contract has a duration of 5 years, subject to renewal and extension. The contract sets out the terms and
conditions pursuant to which the agreed equipment and services will be supplied during duration of the
contract.

- Network Maintenance

We introduced a new preventative maintenance platform in 2016 to monitor our network by categorizing and
ranking the nodes across our network and providing guidance about which system maintenance works are
most needed, which has improved both our network quality and customer satisfaction experience.
Furthermore, our internal maintenance regime is also stricter than industry standards.

Vivacom has made significant investments into its network over the last few years, and it plans to continue the
build out of its fiber network in carefully selected areas based on specific return on investment criteria. We
also intend to invest further in Vivacom’s fixed network, including MPLS and Metro networks, and the fixed
access network, as well as the mobile core and access networks supported by new spectrum frequencies and
microwave licenses for transmission.

**Licenses and Permits**

We believe that we hold substantially all necessary authorization and licenses to provide our services. The
descriptions below summarize the licensing and permit framework for each of our seven operating
jurisdictions.

_Telemach Slovenia._ To be authorized to operate as media and telecommunications service provider in
Slovenia, Telemach Slovenia notified AKOS by providing a short description of its public communication

_Telemach Croatia._ Telemach Croatia holds all necessary permits to operate its business. In particular, it
holds licenses for the use of mobile radio frequency spectrum and the provision of mobile services, which will
expire in 2024. Telemach Croatia is participating in a 5G spectrum frequencies auction in 2021.

**Information Technology**

We operate a modern information technology (“IT”) infrastructure in order to support our business. Our IT
systems are generally managed in house, and also receive external support from manufacturers and suppliers.

Our IT system consists of the following key segments: our operations support system (“OSS”), which supports
our back office activities, including the operation of our network and provision and maintenance of our
customer service; our business support system (“BSS”), which supports our customer facing activities such as
billing, order management and our call center; and our mediation and provisioning system which monitors
and facilitates subscribers’ network access rights and privileges to ensure the security of our resources and
user privacy.

In early 2017, Telemach Slovenia implemented SAP platforms, joining SBB Serbia and Telemach BH which
had already implemented SAP platforms, and thus further facilitating integration. Our OSS applications in
Slovenia are currently managed in house. We are also in the process of implementing a third-party platform in
Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Our mediation and provisioning systems are currently managed in house
with Telemach Slovenia using a different system from the other Group companies.

We have established our own security operations center (“SOC”) team, which is fully equipped in terms of
necessary technology and consists of trained operators to monitor and triage incidents at all times, while
further incident response is performed by engineers and cybersecurity analysts. We will continue to focus on
integrating and streamlining the different IT systems to standardize and further improve our IT solutions.

Vivacom has a well-developed and growing IT environment with a focus on automation and digital presence.
Its IT systems are an integral part of the business process which provide high levels of automation for the
majority of the business in both BSS and OSS and are the main pillar in the digitalization process. The BSS
stack has been transformed to boost Vivacom’s omni channel strategy. Applications supporting online
channels, physical shops, distant sales channels and third-party integration capabilities are integrated with
single product and offer catalog and order management. All channels are powered by big data analytics and
real time marketing offerings. The OSS stack architecture is built to enable an end-to-end service fulfillment
process, working together with the BSS stack. It supports automated provisioning and assurance processes
for mass services including B2C mobile voice and data, fixed voice and data, IPTV and satellite TV and also
combined services.


-----

Forthnet’s IT infrastructure consists of technologies for designing, developing and creating tools to support
the business operations of Forthnet, including virtualization, and modern hardware such as data storage,
servers, security systems and network equipment from vendors such as HP, IBM and Dell. Forthnet also uses
software that is open-source or commercial for monitoring and managing its OSS systems. Forthnet also uses
applications for supporting BSS systems, either developed in-house or purchased through leading software
vendors such as SAP and Oracle.

**Competition**

We face competition from established market participants as well as new market entrants. The nature and
level of the competition we face varies for each of the products and services we offer and for each country in
which we operate. Despite regional differences in the intensity of competition, we compete in each case on the
basis of network quality, content advantage, product and service portfolio specifications, value for money
proposition, marketing, installation speeds and customer care.

Our competitors include, but are not limited to, providers of television, broadband internet, fixed-telephony
services using DSL or fiber connections and mobile-telephony operators, including Telekom Slovenije,
Telekom Austria and T2 in Slovenia, Telekom Srbija, Super Nova and Pošta Srbije in Serbia, A1 Bulgaria,
Telenor Bulgaria and Bulsatcom in Bulgaria, BH Telecom, HT Eronet and Mtel in Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Cosmote, Vodafone and Wind in Greece and M Tel and Crnogorski Telekom in Montenegro. We also compete
against DTH providers, including Digi and Polaris, and DTT providers in Slovenia. Furthermore, we face
competition from providers of television services using alternative and emerging digital technologies such as
IPTV and OTT television. Our Shoppster e-commerce offering also competes with, among others, e-commerce
platforms such as E Kupi in Serbia and Mimovrste, EnaA, Big Bang, Merkur and Piazz (recently launched by
Telekom Slovenije) in Slovenia, as well as traditional retail stores such as Gigatron and Tehnomanija in Serbia.
We also compete with other sources of news, information and entertainment such as social media platforms,
newspapers, movie theatres, live sporting and music events, computer games and home video products. Please
also see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—The cable television, broadband internet,
_DTH and telephony markets in the regions in which we operate are highly competitive.”_

**Property and Equipment**

Our principal asset is our network, which consists of numerous cables, telecommunications installations,
including exchanges of various sizes and transmission equipment.

We lease the headquarters of SBB Serbia in Belgrade, Serbia, as well as SBB Serbia’s technical center in
Belgrade and several other office spaces throughout the country. We also lease the headquarters of Telemach
BH and other minor offices and sales facilities throughout the markets in which we operate. Additionally, we
own most of the equipment needed for our core operations, including the sites housing network hubs. In
Slovenia, we purchased Tušmobil’s headquarters in 2015 and relocated most of our operations to this location.

Vivacom owns or leases property essential for its business operations. Vivacom owns, leases or has other
rights to use or construct on the sites where its mobile and fixed-line telecommunications network equipment
is installed. Vivacom also owns and leases administrative facilities, operational network facilities and retail
facilities throughout Bulgaria.

Forthnet owns an office building in Kallithea and another in Athens and leases two other office buildings in
Athens, one of which serves as the headquarters of Forthnet. It also leases or has other rights to use or
construct on the sites where its fixed-line telecommunications network equipment is installed

We believe that our properties and equipment are in good condition and are suitable and adequate for our
business operations. None of our significant properties are subject to material easements or other third-party
proprietary interests that prevent or restrict the current business activities or that are believed to require major
investments or costs going forward.

**Focus on Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (“ESG”) Matters**

As we have grown our Group, we have increased our emphasis on integrating ESG considerations into our
decision-making and reporting processes. To that end, in 2020, we established a dedicated ESG coordinator
role within the Group. We have also established a multi-disciplinary team of senior executives who, together
with independent consultants, finalized in 2020 a detailed ESG action plan and implementation roadmap.
While more than half of our Group (by revenue) already produces ESG reports, we are working to expand
our current reporting, procedures, products and activities to better identify and address ESG considerations


-----

using, among other standards, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) materiality matrix
for telecommunications and media. Our main goal is to provide fast and reliable connections to information,
knowledge and entertainment, which in itself represents the infrastructure of the modern world on which
many of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals are based.

As part of our continued development in this area, the following are key focus areas and associated KPIs,
which we are using to improve upon existing practices and set and exceed new goals for ESG matters.

- Environmental sustainability. To promote environmental sustainability in our operations, we are taking
active steps to minimize our environmental footprint, while also collecting and analyzing Group historical
data to set future KPI targets for reductions in carbon emissions, climate change policy, energy use and
energy sourcing. We have committed to the Science Based Targets initiative which helps to drive climate
action in the private sector by enabling companies to set emissions reduction targets with scientific data and
to that end we have also submitted a net-zero target in line with a “1.5° future.” During our data gathering,
we determined that electricity represents the greatest source (approximately 86%) and opportunity for the
reduction of carbon emissions by switching to clean energy. We focus on promoting environmental
sustainability through the use of renewable energy, reducing scrap waste, recycling and other strategies. We
are committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions across our offices and infrastructure and we
established a solar power plant in Slovenia in 2019 with an annual production capacity of 254 kWh and
have leveraged our experience in this project to look for additional green energy projects which could cover
a significant part of our carbon emission footprint. In 2020, we consumed 295.5 MWh of energy generated
from all sources and we generated 232.6 MWh of renewable energy from our solar plant in Slovenia. In
addition, we use electric vehicles in our operations where feasible, and we work to exchange old, less-energy
efficient equipment for more energy efficient devices. In 2020, we generated approximately 128.1 thousand
tons of CO2 emissions (9.3 thousand tons of scope 1 emissions and 118.8 thousand tons of scope 2 and
3 emissions), including the contribution of acquired companies, and we target to reduce these to
approximately 50.6 thousand tons by 2030. We are also committed to reducing the climate footprint of our
customers by facilitating access to information, connectivity and entertainment by means of our high speed
network, which provides an incentive to reduce their need to travel. Furthermore, as the rapid development
of broadband, television and IT technology necessitates the continual replacement of legacy network
elements and the upgrading of our networks to accommodate increased bandwidth requirements and new
services, we have introduced waste management procedures, and we regularly recycle obsolete equipment.
In 2020, we recycled 1,539 tons of network telecom equipment, batteries, cables, paper and cardboard. We
are also committed to minimizing waste and we repurpose, reuse or recycle 100% of returned customer
devices and accessories. Certain of our larger telecommunications operations either have achieved or are
pursuing ISO 14001:2015 certification, a global standard for environmental management. We also recognize
the importance of responsible procurement and supply chain management, and to that end, we have
developed Group-level procurement policies to align procurement activities across Group companies,
including adding environmental factors in our request for proposals when engaging with new suppliers. Our
procurement procedure includes multiple checks and verification requirements, such as international
sanctions and reputation risk evaluation.

To promote environmental sustainability in our operations, we expect each of our operating company to
(i) comply with all applicable legal requirements and group-wide environmental policy, (ii) implement
appropriate control, including specific environmental procedures, (iii) implement an environment-focused
management structure, (iv) commit to reduce energy and fuel consumption, as well as business travel and
associated greenhouse gas emissions, (v) commit to the efficient use of resources and materials used for
packaging and products to reduce waste, (vi) commit to a circular economic model, and (viii) provide
selected employees with the relevant environmental management traiining to undertake their duties and
responsibilities effectively.

- Community engagement. We actively support the communities in which we operate, and in 2020, we named
a Group-level director for corporate social responsibility to coordinate efforts in this regard among our
operating companies. At an operational level, our Group companies exercise significant control over their
own community engagement projects due to the particularities of each company, country and culture. We
have as a Group donated €4.5 million in 2020 and €2.6 million for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021,
to groups and activities dedicated to protecting the environment, education and the socially vulnerable, as
well as other donations, such as donating personal protective equipment to help fight COVID-19. We have
also fostered digital inclusivity by engaging in multiple community engagement activities in the past
few years, with a focus on using our platform to deliver knowledge to children (including programs for
online safety), students, the general public and disadvantaged groups, by leveraging our core competencies
in broadband internet and other telecommunications. For 2021, we aim to increase the percentage of staff


-----

participating in a community engagement activity (e.g., volunteering time or knowledge), which in 2020
stood at 7%. As part of our obligations to protect customer data, we are aligning our Group data protection
policies to standardize processes and continue our track record of no fines since GDPR came into force.
We do this via regular training programs, penetration testing and vulnerability scanning of our IT systems,
with some of our Group companies having obtained ISO/IEC 27001:2013 certification as well.

- Corporate and employee responsibility. We focus on building a safe, fair and inclusive working environment
for our employees. To inform our social management targets, we collect data on our workforce, such as
gender mix (55% male, 45% female), percentage of women in management positions (30%, including our
Chief Executive Officer) and percentage of disabled employees (1%), in each case, as of March 31, 2021.
For the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, staff total turnover is 12% and we have experienced
50 workplace injury incidents. We aim to improve these metrics throughout 2021. In particular, we track
gender equality KPIs with the aim of ensuring women’s full and effective participation and equal
opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision making in political, economic and public life. We also
have mandated diversity and inclusion rules and have documented these in employee manuals at our Group
companies, which include, among others, statutory requirements related to workers’ rights and human
rights (e.g., anti-discrimination and anti-mobbing) and annual employee Net Promoter Score (“eNPS”)
measurements. To facilitate further transparency and accountability, we plan to expand our anonymous
suggestion boxes already present in certain of our Group companies and establish whistle-blowing programs
as a distinct transparency function. We also offer training programs to employees which are focused on
improving job-related technical and management skills, as well as on compliance with our internal policies.
We have established internal training centers which manage the entire training process from on-boarding to
organizing advanced technical and management education provided by external experts. In 2020, we began
an ambitious eNPS training program, which we plan to continue in 2021. During this period, we invested
approximately 40 hours of training per employee for new hires and 10 hours per existing employee across
our telecommunication operating companies. Our eNPS training efforts and other initiatives contributed
to a significant increase of 46 points in eNPS score from 2019 to 2020, and it currently averages at +10. In
addition, we have developed a specific supplier code of conduct, which includes elements related to labor
standards, particularly to health and safety and relevant International Labour Organisation standards. We
expect to introduce our supplier code of conduct across all of our companies in the second half of 2021, in
order to harmonize the existing processes and standards already in place at some of our group companies.

- Shareholder support for ESG development. As we continue to make progress in ESG matters, we are wholly
supported in our efforts by our majority shareholder, BC Partners. BC Partners is a primary signatory to
the United Nations’ Principles of Responsible Investments, adopting these principles in 2009. BC Partners
has formalized its commitment to increased standards in its own ESG strategy, and takes an active role in
improving ESG awareness, performance and compliance with us and its other portfolio companies.

**Employees**

As of March 31, 2021, we employed 12,738 employees (11,918 full-time equivalent) across the Netherlands
Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Bulgaria, Greece, North Macedonia and Montenegro.
The following table shows the number of full-time equivalent employees as of March 31, 2021, by category:

-----

We believe that our relationship with our employees is satisfactory. During the last three years, we have not
experienced any strikes or work outages, and currently we know of 637 of our employees are members of a
labor union (the Forthnet Labour union does not provide us with access to their lists of registered members).

**Insurance**

Our fixed assets such as technical and office equipment in our network operating centers, network hubs, head
ends and office locations are protected by insurance policies covering damage from fire and other catastrophes.
We also have separate insurance covering losses from machinery breakdown and insurance for interruption
and operating costs. While we have no insurance against the risk of failure by subscribers to pay, we have
alternative controls to mitigate this risk, including collection processes and arrangements with collections
agencies. We provide directors’ and officers’ liability insurance for all members of our board of directors, as
well as certain other persons within our Group.

We believe that our existing insurance coverage, including the amounts of coverage and the conditions thereto,
provides reasonable protection, taking into account the costs for the insurance coverage and the potential
risks to business operations. However, we cannot guarantee that no losses will be incurred or that claims that
go beyond the type and scope of the existing insurance coverage will not be filed against it.

**Legal Proceedings**

We are involved in a number of legal proceedings. Other than as discussed below, we do not expect the legal
proceedings in which we are involved or with which we have been threatened to have a material adverse effect
on our financial position or profitability. The outcome of legal proceedings, however, can be extremely difficult
to predict with certainty, and no assurance can be offered in this regard.

**_Litigation Matters Relating to Telemach Slovenia (as successor to Tušmobil)_**

_Administrative Matters_

A block of spectrum that we were granted and use for part of Telemach Slovenia’s 3G mobile network may be
subject to a renewed tender or other regulatory action.

The grant of this block of 2x5 MHz of spectrum in the 2100 MHz band in 2008 to Tušmobil (which in
April 2015 was acquired by, and later merged into, Telemach Slovenia) was successfully challenged before the
Slovenian administrative court. This block of spectrum is valid through 2023 and is used to operate part of
Telemach Slovenia’s 3G mobile network. The grant of this block of spectrum was challenged by certain
competitors on the grounds that Tušmobil obtained the spectrum (i) without satisfying certain requirements
of a public tender and (ii) as a consequence of Tušmobil participating in the tender as the only interested
party, obtaining such spectrum free of charge. The case arising from this challenge has been through various
levels of reviews and decisions by AKOS, the Slovenian administrative court, the Slovenian Supreme Court
and the Slovenian constitutional court. Some of these decisions reaffirmed the initial grant of this block of
spectrum. However, the Slovenian administrative court ordered in November 2017 that the tender process be
renewed and that Telekom Slovenije (a Slovenian competitor of Telemach Slovenia) be allowed to participate
in the renewed grant process. This order has become final.

On May 31, 2019, following the Slovenian Administrative Court’s final ruling in November 2017, AKOS
issued a new decision by which it rejected Tušmobil’s request from January 30, 2008 (as amended on April 3,
2008) for allocation of spectrum in the 2100 MHz band and reversed its 2008 decision with effect from
September 30, 2019. On June 30, 2019, we filed a lawsuit challenging AKOS’ May 31, 2019 decision together
with a motion to issue an interim injunction to stay AKOS’ decision until the Slovenian Administrative Court
reaches a final decision. On July 11, 2019, the Slovenian Administrative Court issued an interim injunction
staying AKOS’ decision pending a final decision on the lawsuit, and therefore Telemach Slovenia remained
entitled to use such spectrum. On July 5, 2021, the Slovenian administrative court ruled in our favor reversing
AKOS’ May 31, 2019 decision and sent the matter back to AKOS to undertake a new determination process.

Notwithstanding such recent ruling by the Slovenian administrative court, we cannot eliminate the possibility
that we may not be successful in a renewed tender or that a charge may be imposed by AKOS for the past use
of the spectrum or that we may need to pay a fee or rent for use of the spectrum. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Relating to Our Business and Industry—We have made and may make acquisitions or enter into transactions_
_that may present unforeseen risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated_
_at the time of any transaction and, additionally, there are risks associated with the integration of any_
_acquisitions.”_


-----

In 2016, Telemach Slovenia was successful in acquiring additional 2100 MHZ (valid through September 2021)
and 1800 MHz (valid through January 2031) spectrum licenses. In April 2021, a spectrum auction for all
available mobile spectrum bands was held in Slovenia, and Telemach Slovenia was successful in bidding for
2x10 MHz in the 700 MHz band, 20 MHz in the 1500 MHz band, 2x15 MHz in the 2100 MHz band, 30 MHz
in 2300 MHZ band, 140 MHz in the 3600 MHz band and 200 MHz in the 26 GHz band. These licenses are
valid for 15 years. Courts have so far dismissed on procedural grounds two challenges brought by one of the
operators against the auctions results. As of the date of this offering memorandum, the deadline in which an
interested person could challenge the decision on allocation of such frequencies before the administrative
court has passed, and we have not been served with any such challenge. However, the absence of such challenge
could not yet be officially confirmed.

We believe that these additional frequencies granted in 2016 (and currently used by Telemach Slovenia) and
frequencies acquired in 2021 mitigate the impact of any potential loss of the block of 2x5 MHz of spectrum
in the 2100 MHz band that was granted to Tušmobil in 2008 and which will expire in 2023, after which they
will be assigned to another bidder who secures them for the period after 2023.

_Criminal Matters_

Certain criminal matters were initiated in Slovenia against Telemach Slovenia (as successor to Tušmobil)
which are still pending against Tušmobil’s former owner Mirko Tuš and Tomaž Simonič (the former head of
AKOS). Pursuant to a bill of indictment that was filed in March 2015 (and amended in May 2019) by the
public prosecutor in connection with these criminal matters, which were initially instigated by Tušmobil’s
competitors in 2008, it is alleged that, among other things, Tušmobil and Mirko Tuš made illegal payments to
Tomaž Simonič, a former head of AKOS, to obtain the grant of a block of 2x5 MHz of spectrum in the 2100
MHz band in 2008. The bill of indictment filed by the public prosecutor also challenges AKOS’ decision in
2006 to allow Tušmobil to exchange a certain radio frequency band (1,800 MHz) for another band (900 MHz)
at no charge and without obtaining the views of other interested parties. It is also alleged that Tušmobil and
Mirko Tuš made illegal payments to the former head of AKOS to obtain the exchange of frequencies at no
cost. Due to the expiration of the statute of limitations, Telemach Slovenia as a legal entity has been found
free of criminal liability (with the effect of finality) and related exposure to penalties or fines. However, as a
beneficiary of the frequencies grant, Telemach Slovenia may be jointly and severally liable with other
defendants (against which proceedings are still pending) for indemnification of the allegedly illegally gained
benefit if any of the remaining defendants are found guilty. In February 2020, the first instance court acquitted
Mr. Simonič of the charges in the amended bill of indictment (misuse of the public positions or rights). In
December 2020, upon the public prosecutor’s appeal, the Higher Court of Ljubljana annulled this judgment
and returned the case to the first instance court for retrial. The criminal proceedings against Mirko Tuš have
been from time to time separated from the other trials and may be conducted separately.

In a related development, in January 2016, the Republic of Slovenia made a claim against Mirko Tuš and
Telemach Slovenia for indemnification in an amount of €7.2 million. During the pre-trial hearings, Telemach
Slovenia contested the grounds for, and challenged the amount of, this claim. While the bill of indictment
filed by the public prosecutor in March 2015 had indicated that Tušmobil allegedly illegally gained benefit in
an amount of approximately €7.2 million, representing a valuation of the potential charge for the frequency
bands under challenge, which had been estimated by an expert appointed by the court for such purpose,
Telemach Slovenia has contested and opposed, and intends to continue to contest and oppose this valuation.

Furthermore, if either of the two remaining defendants is found guilty in any of these criminal matters,
AKOS could in turn review, whether upon its own initiative or if ordered to do so by a competent authority,
the grant of the block of 2x5 MHz of spectrum in the 2100 MHz band to Tušmobil and potentially annul its
prior allotment decision and initiate new proceedings for the allotment of the block of spectrum.

If any payment obligation is imposed against Telemach Slovenia or the criminal procedure is closed with any
negative impact in these matters, we, in turn, could seek to recover these amounts from Tušmobil’s seller based
on certain provisions set forth in the transaction documents that we have entered into with Tušmobil’s seller.
For instance, under the share sale and purchase agreement, we have recourse to up to €168 million in
indemnification from the seller for losses arising from breaches of warranties related to financial crime, which
we could seek to claim against in the event of a final, non-appealable judgment requiring Tušmobil to pay
monetary fines or in the case of a negative impact to the conduct of business, reputation and assets of
Telemach Slovenia resulting from the criminal procedure (which indemnification is not available for the
separate AKOS proceeding described under “—Administrative Matters”). However, we may not be successful
in any actions to claim indemnity or damages from Tušmobil’s seller in a timely manner or at all, and the
indemnifying party may not have sufficient funds to fulfil its indemnification obligations. See “Risk Factors—


-----

_Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—We have made and may make acquisitions or enter into_
_transactions that may present unforeseen risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were_
_contemplated at the time of any transaction and, additionally, there are risks associated with the integration of_
_any acquisitions.”_

The AKOS administrative action and the criminal proceedings described above relate to the block of spectrum
obtained by Tušmobil in 2008 (and the exchange of certain frequency bands in 2006), and do not affect the
ownership or validity of the spectrum used for 4G/LTE and legacy 2G that Tušmobil was awarded in 2014
(for the period from 2014 to 2029) or the ownership or validity of the additional 3G and 4G/LTE frequencies
allotted to Telemach Slovenia in 2016 (for periods until 2021 and 2031) or the recently acquired spectrum at
the auction in April 2021. Nevertheless, if the AKOS action or the pending criminal proceedings are
determined in a manner adverse to Telemach Slovenia, and Telemach Slovenia is required to lease such block
of spectrum in the future, or is required to pay a material amount as part of an indemnity, and Telemach
Slovenia is not able to recover such amounts from the Tušmobil seller, such developments could have a material
adverse effect on our financial position and profitability.

**_Investment Arbitration with Serbia_**

On October 6, 2020, we, together with two of our affiliates, served the Republic of Serbia with a Notice of
Dispute under the agreement on encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments between the
Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Serbia (“BIT”). In such Notice of Dispute, it was asserted
that Serbia breached several obligations under the BIT, including, among others, the obligation to accord fair
and equitable treatment, national treatment and most constant protection and security. We argued that,
beginning in 2014, we have been a target of a series of arbitrary, unlawful measures taken by various Serbian
authorities and entities as part of a widespread, orchestrated campaign to reduce SBB Serbia’s market
presence and to promote the interests of Telekom Srbija.

The Republic of Serbia failed to respond to the Notice of Dispute within the three-month deadline established
by the BIT. On January 7, 2021, we submitted a Request for Arbitration to the International Centre for
Settlement of Investment Disputes. The parties have appointed arbitrators, and we have until September 3,
2021, to make a detailed written submission.

**_Investigation by the Serbian Tax Authority_**

On December 27, 2018, the Serbian Tax Authority notified us that it had begun a tax investigation of SBB
Serbia for the year ended December 31, 2012. In March 2019, the Serbian Tax Authority issued a decision
that it had recharacterized interest payments made by SBB Serbia under an intragroup loan agreement (and
certain other transactions) as dividends, the payments of which would have been subject to a 5% withholding
tax. The total contingent liability under this decision amounts to €21 million, including late interest. We have
assessed these matters internally and through external consultants, and it is our view that there is no basis for
the Serbian Tax Authority’s decision. We have appealed to the Serbian Ministry of Finance and received a
prolongation of our obligation to pay any amounts until resolution of the appeal. We have also submitted a
request for a mutual agreement procedure (“MAP”) for our Dutch entities to the Dutch Ministry of Finance
on the basis that the Serbian taxation decision is not in compliance with the double taxation treaty between
the Netherlands and Serbia. The Dutch Ministry of Finance has notified the Serbian Tax Authority of the
MAP procedure. The Dutch Ministry of Finance has also submitted a letter to the Serbian Ministry of
Finance stating that Serbia has misclassified the interest payments and is in breach of the bilateral double
taxation treaty. On October 12, 2020, the Serbian Ministry of Finance annulled the Serbian Tax Authority’s
decision and instructed the Serbian Tax Authority to restart the procedure, taking into account the arguments
provided in SBB Serbia’s appeal.

The Serbian Tax Authority also informed SBB Serbia that it is opening a tax review for the years 2013 through
2016. SBB Serbia intends to continue contesting the Serbian Tax Authority’s findings. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—We may be adversely affected by changes to tax legislation or its_
_interpretation or increases in effective tax rates in the jurisdictions in which it operates, or challenges to our tax_
_position.”_

**_Dispute with Minority Shareholders of KATV HS d.o.o. and HKB net d.o.o._**

We assumed a number of legal disputes in connection with our acquisition of KATV HS d.o.o. (“HS”), HKB
net d.o.o. (“HKB”) and M&H Company d.o.o. (“M&H”) as part of the Bosnian Acquisitions in 2015.
Specifically, we assumed certain claims brought by the minority shareholder of both HS and HKB, most of


-----

which claims have been brought against HS and HKB, as well as their former majority shareholders and
former management. These include certain claims asserted in a civil lawsuit brought in the period from 2013
to 2015 seeking damages relating to alleged breaches of contractual and/or statutory duties by HS, HKB,
M&H, the former majority shareholder and the former management of these companies. The aggregate
amount claimed by the minority shareholder in these cases is approximately €12.2 million, plus interest and
costs of the proceedings. These claims are in the preliminary stages of litigation, and no final, enforceable
decision will be rendered until the claims have been adjudicated by both the court of first instance and (if
appealed) the secondary appellate court. It is difficult to estimate the final amount of damages (which will, in
due course, be subject to valuation by an expert appointed by the court) and when such adjudication would be
completed.

In June 2015, the minority shareholder of HS and HKB also brought a civil lawsuit seeking to annul Telemach
BH’s purchase of HS and HKB. Specifically, the former minority shareholder contended that it was not
provided with sufficient information to allow it to determine whether to exercise its statutory right of first
refusal relating to the sale of HS and HKB. This claim is still in the preliminary stages. The aggregate purchase
price paid for the acquisition of HS and HKB as approximately €7 million. The minority shareholder has also
brought a number of additional claims against Telemach BH and, in the alternative, HS, HKB and M&H
relating to the corporate decision by which certain business opportunities were transferred to M&H from HS
and HKB, allegedly undertaken by the former majority shareholder of these companies. While we do not
believe that these claims are well-founded, we have nonetheless out of an abundance of caution suspended the
contracts for which these claims were initiated.

The minority shareholder has also filed a criminal complaint with the office of the public prosecutor in Bosnia
and Herzegovina alleging criminal wrongdoing by the former majority shareholder and former management
of these companies. This proceeding is still in the investigative phase, and no indictment or other criminal
charge has been filed. The status of, and information relating to, criminal investigations generally in Bosnia
and Herzegovina is not publicly available.

**_Disputes with SAZAS Relating to Infringement of Copyrights_**

Since 2012, we have been involved in numerous court procedures regarding payment of copyright fees for
cable retransmission of musical copyright works on retransmitted TV and radio channels, to the Slovenian
Association of Composers and Authors (“SAZAS”), the collective copyrights protection organization, in the
aggregate amount of approximately €4.6 million, plus late payment interest and legal costs.

The proceedings are at different stages, as the proceedings that began in 2012 and 2016, and some of the
proceedings that began in 2018 and 2019, are currently being considered by the Constitutional Court, while
some of the proceedings that were initiated in 2018, 2019 and 2020 are pending before either the first instance
court or the Higher Court. In all of the pending cases, United Group has filed legal challenges to any adverse
decisions of the courts. Where the court decisions issued in the respective proceedings have already become
final, we have paid the amounts adjudicated by the courts, while in July 2021 we have also paid the most
commonly adjudicated amount per user for the period 2016 to mitigate the accrual of the late payment interest.

On March 4, 2021, the Copyright Board in Slovenia issued its decision setting a tariff for the use of musical
works at €0.24 per subscriber per month for retransmission of up to 100 television and 60 radio channels, and
€0.27 per subscriber per month for retransmission of more than 100 television and 60 radio channels. The
Association of cable operators in Slovenia (an economic interest association of which we are a member) is
challenging the Copyright Board decision in court.

**_Dispute with Copyright Institute_**

On April 28, 2021, the Copyright Institute, an organization representing four Slovenian broadcasters
(NovaTV24.si d.d., Pro TV d.o.o., TV 3 d.o.o. and Topstream d.o.o.), filed a claim against Telemach Slovenia
for €9.7 million in allegedly unpaid license fees for broadcasting their TV channels, increased by civil penalty
and late interest. The plaintiff argues that under Slovenian law, Telemach Slovenia is required to carry the
relevant channels and must pay them fees proportional to those that it pays to other channels. We consider
this claim to be unfounded and against EU rules applicable to “must-carry” programming. This case is
pending.

**_Dispute with BS Group d.o.o., Brus in Regard to Producer’s Rights_**

In 2016, BS GROUP DOO BRUS (“BS”) initiated legal proceedings against SBB Serbia before the
Commercial Court in Belgrade, claiming damages in the amount of approximately €25 million. BS claims that


-----

SBB Serbia violated BS’s producer rights in respect of certain of its television series and films by broadcasting
them outside of Serbia. SBB Serbia has responded to the claims. Subsequently, a court expert report dated as
of December 6, 2019, concluded that broadcasts had occurred outside of Serbia. SBB Serbia submitted
comments made by its own expert challenging the court expert’s report. The next hearing in this case is
scheduled for September 8, 2021.

**_Sport Klub Divestiture Ruling and Investigation of Alleged Abuse of Dominant Position_**

On September 4, 2018, the Slovenian Competition Protection Agency ruled that our acquisition of United
Media Distribution (then known as IKO Balkan) in 2012 was incompatible with Slovenian competition rules.
The Slovenian Competition Protection Agency also ordered us to divest the activity of broadcasting the Sport
Klub (SK) TV channels within six months and imposed a ban prohibiting us from broadcasting sports TV
channels in Slovenia (with the exception of the existing Fight Channel) for the period of three years from the
day we transfer the Sport Klub (SK) TV channels to a suitable buyer. The activity of broadcasting Sport Klub
(SK) TV channels includes purchasing rights for transmitting audiovisual sport TV content for Sport Klub
(SK) TV channels, producing Sport Klub (SK) TV channels and offering Sport Klub (SK) TV channels to
operators in the wholesale TV channel market, in each case, limited to the territory of Slovenia. The Slovenian
Supreme Court has stayed the implementation of the Slovenian Competition Protection Authority’s
divestment decision until a final decision on the merits of this case is issued. With a judgment dated May 21,
2020, the administrative court annulled the decision of the Competition Protection Agency and ordered the
Agency to restart the concentration assessment procedure. The Agency is now required to reexamine the
transaction and adopt a new decision. Although the decision on divestiture only relates to Slovenia, it may
have negative consequences for us in other markets, including on our reputation, brand equity and perceived
value proposition, which could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.

In relation to this proceeding, the Slovenian Competition Protection Authority in a separate (misdemeanor)
proceeding imposed on United Media Limited a fine of €3.7 million for delayed merger control filing. We
challenged this fine before the administrative court. On January 11, 2021, the administrative court ruled that
the fine should be reduced to €1.56 million. We appealed this ruling and requested a further reduction in the
amount of the fine.

Moreover, independently from any final decision related to the merger approval, in addition to an obligation
to comply with the decision, a fine of up to a legal maximum of 10% of our annual revenue could be imposed
on us in a separate misdemeanor proceeding for not having obtained merger clearance prior to operating IKO
Balkan. In previous decisions when the Slovenian Competition Protection Agency has, following or in parallel
with granting merger clearance, levied fines against companies for exercising control prior to obtaining merger
clearance, the percentage of the fine has been materially less than 10% of the overall group revenue, and in an
unrelated recent case, the Slovenian Competition Protection Agency fined an undertaking for failure to
provide notification of a concentration in the amount of approximately €54 million, which, according to
publicly available sources, amounted to approximately 1% of the relevant group’s revenue, whereby such fine
was later reduced by the County Court of Ljubljana to €1,000,000.

In February 2015, the Slovenian Competition Protection Agency initiated an investigation regarding alleged
abuse of dominant position by United Media Limited, former company IKO Balkan (now United Media
Distribution) and its former Slovenian subsidiary IKO Media PRO d.o.o. in the wholesale market for the
supply of pay-TV sports channels in Slovenia for a period beginning around August 2012. This proceeding is
currently pending as no statement of objections has been issued by the Slovenian Competition Protection
Agency. Possible impacts of a decision adverse to us include: (i) an obligation to cease the infringement (if
any); (ii) imposition of measures to remedy any proven abuse of dominant position; (iii) imposition of a
monetary fine of up to 10% of the annual turnover of United Media Limited and United Media Distribution
in the preceding business year; (iv) the imposition of a criminal charge; and (v) damages claims from third
parties. We cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding, and we can offer no assurances as to the effects of
a decision adverse to us.

**_RTS_**

RTS, the plaintiff, requested judicial determination of whether a breach of their rights as the broadcasting
manufacturer of certain RTS channels (RTS 1, RTS 2, RTS 3 and RTS HD) had occurred due to distribution
of these channels via EON. RTS claimed approximately €1.5 million in damages and a temporary injunction
seeking to prohibit SBB Serbia from broadcasting the plaintiff’s programs. The Serbian Law on Electronic
Media categorizes RTS programs as “must carry” channels which all media operators in Serbia are obligated
to carry, regardless of what platforms operators employ in their distribution. On February 26, 2019, the trial


-----

court determined a breach of RTS’rights as the broadcasting manufacturer had occurred and prohibited SBB
Serbia from distributing RTS programs via EON but denied the claim for damages. The trial court also
dismissed SBB Serbia’s counterclaim for a determination that SBB Serbia is permitted to broadcast and
distribute RTS channels. On January 28, 2021, the Commercial Appellate Court annulled the first instance
decision and returned the case for retrial. The re-trial was concluded on June 1, 2021. However, on June 21,
2021, the court decided to re-open the main hearing in order to supplement evidentiary proceedings. The next
hearing is scheduled for October 14, 2021.

RTS filed a further claim against SBB Serbia for distribution of the channels through Total TV, Net TV Plus,
Telemach Montenegro, Telemach Slovenia and Telemach Bosnia and Herzegovina without an appropriate
contract and without paying contributions. RTS claimed approximately €1 million in damages. This case is
pending and a preliminary hearing is scheduled for November 4, 2021.

**_Beogradske Elektrane_**

Beogradske Elektrane, a public utility company responsible for Belgrade’s power plants, and the City of
Belgrade (collectively, the “BE Plaintiffs”) have filed a claim against SBB Serbia for €10 million, claiming
unjust enrichment based on unauthorized use of their utility ducts for the installation of fiber optics
infrastructure. The BE Plaintiffs have also petitioned the court to declare SBB Serbia’s optical fiber network
an asset of common interest owned by the City of Belgrade. They also seek to impose an obligation on SBB
Serbia to remove the network or to pay the BE Plaintiffs a fee in the amount of €100 million which represents
an amount designated by the BE Plaintiffs and, as such, should not be directly enforceable against SBB Serbia
(even in the event the court rules in favor of the BE Plaintiffs) as the payment thereof represents only an
alternative option for SBB Serbia to be allowed to maintain the network in case the court rules that the
network should be removed. This case is currently pending and a preparatory hearing is scheduled for
September 16, 2021.

**_EPS (Serbian Electricity Utility Company)_**

For the construction and maintenance of its network, SBB Serbia entered into contracts with the Serbian
Electricity Utility Company (“EPS”) on the placement of its network infrastructure on utility poles in different
cities in Serbia. Generally, the relevant agreements are entered into for up to one year. The price under these
agreements was initially €10-12.2 per pole per year. However, in late 2018, EPS increased prices to €20-25 per
pole per year. EPS did not provide an adequate reasoning for such a substantial price increase. In January 2019,
SBB Serbia submitted a complaint against these pricing practices to the Serbian Competition Authority. In
June 2019, SBB Serbia submitted a request for joint usage of EPS infrastructure to RATEL. In October 2019,
RATEL granted SBB Serbia the right to jointly use EPS infrastructure but left the question of pricing open,
claiming that if the price offered by EPS is regulated differently the operators that already signed contracts
under such commercial terms would end up in an unequal position. Both EPS and SBB Serbia challenged
RATEL’s decision before the Administrative Court, and this case is currently pending.

In February 2020, EPS brought a claim against SBB Serbia before the Belgrade Commercial Court for
€1.18 million allegedly due by SBB Serbia for the usage of EPS’s infrastructure. EPS also asked the Court to
order SBB Serbia to remove its equipment from EPS infrastructure. A preliminary hearing was held on
October 14, 2020. At the hearing, SBB Serbia challenged the Court’s jurisdiction and the Court announced
that it would issue a separate ruling on this issue. On November 4, 2020, SBB Serbia received the Court’s
ruling rejecting SBB Serbia’s objections to the Court’s jurisdiction; SBB Serbia appealed this ruling. The
Court has not yet scheduled a hearing on the merits.

**_Slobodna Televizija_**

In January 2020, Slobodna Televizija, the plaintiff, requested a judicial determination of a breach of
competition rules, including the alleged abuse of dominant position by SBB Serbia, and the alleged collusion
of SBB Serbia and Adria News DOO based on the alleged unlawful prevention of the TV channel, Slobodna
Televizija, from being made available in the SBB Serbia media distribution system. Slobodna Televizija
claimed approximately € 2.8 million in damages and asked the court to order SBB Serbia to enter into a
distribution agreement with Slobodna Televizija, specifying the terms and conditions of the distribution of
the Slobodna Televizija TV channel. On February 14, 2020, SBB Serbia and Adria News DOO submitted
their response to the lawsuit, arguing that the court is not authorized to determine the breach of competition
rules due to the fact that the case falls under the exclusive authority of the Serbian Competition Protection
Commission. Furthermore, SBB and Adria News DOO claimed that the lawsuit does not fulfill the basic


-----

procedural requirements, and it is unsubstantiated. The trial was concluded on June 7, 2021 and the trial court
dismissed the plaintiff’s claim.

**_Litigation relating to Grand Production_**

In October 2020, Saša Mirković, a producer of the Serbian singer, Aleksandar Vuksanović, sued Grand
Production (a subsidiary of United Media) for € 9 million. The plaintiff claims that he entered into an
exclusivity agreement with Mr. Vuksanović and that Grand Production violated that agreement by making
Mr. Vuksanović appear on one of its shows. On October 29, 2020, Grand Production filed its response to the
lawsuit. On April 13, 2021, the court dismissed the plaintiff’s claim and rejected the plaintiff's request for a
preliminary measure filed with the aim to freeze Grand Production’s assets. The plaintiff appealed this ruling,
and the case is now pending in the court of appeals.

**_Unfair competition claims by Telekom Srbija_**

In 2020, Telekom Srbija initiated proceedings before the Belgrade Commercial Court and Zurich Commercial
Court against several entities belonging to United Group in relation to alleged acts of unfair competition
against the plaintiff. In both proceedings, Telekom Srbija argued that it suffered harm as a result of defamatory
statements allegedly made by the defendants in relation to Telekom Srbija’s business operations. In its
proceedings before the Belgrade Commercial Court, Telekom Srbija is suing SBB Serbia, United Media Digital
d.o.o. Beograd, Adria News S.à r.l. and United Group B.V., and is claiming damages of approximately
€80 million. In its proceedings before the Zurich Commercial Court, the plaintiff is suing United Media
Network AG, United Group B.V., United Media S.à r.l. and Adria News S.à r.l., and is claiming damages of
approximately CHF 1.35 million. We consider that neither of these courts has jurisdiction to review these
claims and that, in any event, these claims are without merit and are not supported by any evidence. The
proceedings before both courts are ongoing. Preliminary hearings in the proceedings before the Belgrade
Commercial Court are scheduled for October 12, 2021.

**_Elins Panic_**

In February 2018, Elins Panic KEP d.o.o., submitted a claim against Telemach BH, as successor of BHB
Cable TV d.o.o. Lukavac (“BHB”), which was acquired by Telemach BH in 2014. The plaintiff has asked the
court to determine the validity of the acquisition agreement between Telemach and BHB and to determine
whether an asset purchase agreement between the plaintiff as seller and BHB as buyer of the entire cable
infrastructure of a district, which was a major part of the cable infrastructure shown as the property of BHB.
The proceeding is pending.

**_Litigation Matters Relating to Tele2 Croatia (now trading as Telemach Croatia)_**

In the ordinary course of its business, Tele2 Croatia (which we acquired in March 2020) entered into factoring
agreements with Raiffeisen factoring d.o.o., Zagreb, whereby Tele2 Croatia assigned some of its accounts
receivables relating to one of its main distributors. The assignment was made on a recourse basis, with Tele2
Croatia bearing the risk towards the distributor that was part of the corporate group facing solvency problems.
In April 2017, Raiffeisen factoring d.o.o., Zagreb, initiated a lawsuit against Tele2 Croatia for approximately
€5.6 million based on such recourse agreements. Tele2 Croatia has disputed the claims and has filed a
counterclaim against the plaintiff in the amount of approximately €5.6 million. The plaintiff was merged with
Raiffeisenbank Austria d.d., Zagreb, and therefore Raiffeisenbank Austria d.d., Zagreb is its legal successor/
successor in title and the counterparty in court case. This case is pending before the Commercial Court of
Zagreb.

**_Viva Telecom Bulgaria EOOD’s previous Shareholder Litigation_**

On July 31, 2020, United Group Bulgaria EOOD (“United Group Bulgaria”) acquired the entire share capital
of Viva Telecom Bulgaria EOOD (“Viva Telecom”) from InterV Investment S.à r.l (“InterV” or the “Viva
Telecom Former Shareholder”) pursuant to the terms and conditions of the sale and purchase agreement
between United Group Bulgaria and InterV, dated November 7, 2019, as amended from time to time (the
“Vivacom Acquisition Agreement”, and the acquisition pursuant to the Vivacom Acquisition Agreement,
hereafter referred to as the “Vivacom Acquisition”).

InterV was purchased by its former shareholders by way of private sale closed in August 2016 from its creditors
following a sale process run by Ernst & Young after an enforcement of security over its shares by such
creditors. Certain previous direct and indirect shareholders of the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder have


-----

initiated legal proceedings in the United Kingdom and Luxembourg which relate to the ownership of shares
in the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder. Certain other legal proceedings in relation to Vivacom and its
previous share ownership and obligations in Bulgaria have been resolved. The following is a description of
ongoing legal proceedings in relation to these matters.

_United Kingdom Litigation_

Certain previous direct and indirect shareholders of the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder initiated legal
proceedings in the United Kingdom in 2016, alleging that the auction pursuant to which the Viva Telecom
Former Shareholder’s current shareholders acquired the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder was a sham and
part of a fraudulent conspiracy, and seeking an order that the 2016 sale be unwound and/or that damages be
awarded. In February 2018, the courts in the United Kingdom dismissed all claims aimed at unwinding the
sale and dismissed a claim for damages in respect of the alleged loss of the indirect interest in the Viva Telecom
Former Shareholder by its previous indirect shareholders. New claims were brought on behalf of the previous
direct shareholder of the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder, which were struck out by the UK courts in
July 2019 for lack of authority and on jurisdictional grounds.

Currently, the only outstanding claim in the United Kingdom is a damages claim between certain indirect
former shareholders of the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder against (among others) former shareholders
and former creditors of the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder for the alleged loss of opportunity to
participate in the 2016 auction and acquire control over the Vivacom Group. The outstanding English
proceedings were stayed in January 2020 (and remain so) pending the outcome of the Main Luxembourg
Proceedings (as defined below). Such damages claim relates to matters as between certain indirect former
shareholders of the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder and former shareholders and creditors of the Viva
Telecom Former Shareholder and therefore does not relate to Vivacom or us as the claim has no relation to
the Vivacom Acquisition.

_Luxembourg Litigation_

- Main Luxembourg Proceedings

After dismissal in February 2018 and July 2019 of the claims in relation to the unwinding of the 2016 sale in
the United Kingdom, the complainants (previous direct and indirect shareholders of the Viva Telecom Former
Shareholder acting through managers of its indirect shareholder) re-instated their claims in Luxembourg in
July 2019 (the “Main Luxembourg Proceedings”). Similarly to the proceedings in the United Kingdom, the
complainants are seeking to unwind the 2016 sale of the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder and/or to receive
damages.

While the outcome of the Main Luxembourg Proceedings cannot be determined, we believe that, on the basis
of the information and documents we possess, it is likely a Luxembourg judge will rule in a similar manner as
the UK courts. Even if a Luxembourg judge did agree with the complainants, we believe that the most likely
remedy would be the payment of damages by the former direct and/or indirect owners of the Viva Telecom
Former Shareholder (or other persons/entities involved in the 2016 sale) to previous owners of the Viva
Telecom Former Shareholder, rather than any remedy involving Vivacom or us.

Further, an outcome favorable to the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder’s previous direct and indirect
shareholders is unlikely to have an adverse impact on us or the Vivacom Group. Other than in respect of the
Vivacom Acquisition Agreement, neither we nor United Group Bulgaria have a direct or indirect relationship
with the former direct or indirect shareholders of the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder. Moreover, United
Group Bulgaria acquired Viva Telecom’s shares (and not the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder shares) in an
arm’s length transaction for fair market value pursuant to a public auction process organized by a reputable
financial advisor.

The Main Luxembourg Proceedings are ongoing and are expected to continue for at least the next two to
three years. Although we have been summoned to join the Main Luxembourg Proceedings (as described
below), the Main Luxembourg Proceedings and the Intervention Proceedings (as defined below) are currently
managed separately by the Luxembourg Court, so that we are currently not requested to actively participate
in the Main Luxembourg Proceedings.

- Intervention Proceedings

Following signing of the Vivacom Acquisition Agreement, we have been summoned to be joined to the Main
Luxembourg Proceedings (the “Intervention Proceedings”) for purposes of putting us on notice of the Main


-----

Luxembourg Proceedings. No claims have been made against us in the Intervention Proceedings and the
Intervention Proceedings are still ongoing. The complainants in the Main Luxembourg Proceedings have in
the meantime withdrawn their intervention claim. However, as we have raised doubts as to the formal
procedural validity of this withdrawal, the parties are currently in the process of filing briefs on the withdrawal
(among other issues).

- Second Luxembourg Proceedings

In March and April 2020, previous direct and indirect shareholders of the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder
initiated new proceedings in Luxembourg (the “Second Luxembourg Proceedings”). Similar to the Main
Luxembourg Proceedings, the claimants argue that the 2016 sale of the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder
should be unwound, and as a consequence, any subsequent event resulting from that sale, including the
Vivacom Acquisition should also be unwound.

The parties are currently exchanging written submissions, and given the large number of defendants, the
proceedings in Luxembourg are expected to continue for at least the next two to three years.

**_Acquisitions of local broadband and television operators in Bulgaria_**

On April 29, 2021, Vivacom acquired local broadband and television operators Net 1 EOOD, ComNet Sofia
EAD and Digital Cable Television EOOD. These transactions were approved by the Bulgarian Commission
on Protection of Competition (“CPC”). On April 29, 2021, Telenor Bulgaria challenged the CPC’s approval
relating to these transactions before the Administrative Court—Sofia District. Vivacom has intervened in
support of the CPC’s decision. We believe that the CPC’s decisions were well-reasoned and consistent with
Bulgarian competition law. These appeals did not suspend the acquisitions and Vivacom has proceeded with
integrating the acquired operators. If the Administrative Court—Sofia District annuls the CPC’s approvals,
and the annulment is upheld by the Supreme Administrative Court, the CPC will re-examine the transactions.

**_Bulgarian tax audits_**

Both Viva Telecom and Vivacom are subject to several tax audits. These tax audits and related proceedings are
being carried out in a variety of venues and are being challenged as appropriate. The companies have already
paid the amounts ascertained by the tax audits, and in the case respective challenges are successful, an amount
of up to BGN 12.5 million and associated interest could be recovered.

**Regulatory Framework**

**_Slovenia_**

Telecommunications operations in Slovenia are subject to the EU framework on telecommunications
regulation. The act governing telecommunications in Slovenia is the Electronic Communications Act (Zakon
o elektronskih komunikacijah—ZEKom-1), which came into force on January 15, 2013 (as amended). The
principal objectives of ZEKom-1 include promoting the development of electronic communications networks
and services, including encouraging investment by lowering construction and set up costs of such networks
and the development of services in the Republic of Slovenia alongside economic and social development, the
establishment of effective competition on the electronic communications market, and consumer protection.
The act aims to achieve these objectives principally by governing the conditions for the provision of electronic
communication networks and services, effective construction and set up of such networks and shared use of
existing physical infrastructure, ensuring competition, determining users’ rights, regulating the security and
operation of networks and services in emergency situations, the protection of secrecy and confidentiality of
electronic communications and setting forth the responsibilities and tasks of AKOS, which is an independent
body that, among other things, regulates and supervises the electronic communications market.

_Becoming an Operator_

A legal entity seeking to become an operator is required to notify AKOS about its intent to operate public
communication networks or to provide public communication services prior to the beginning of the
performance of its activities. The notification must include the required general information about the legal
entity (such as the name and address, legal representatives etc.), a short description of the public
communication networks or public communication services, as well as a description of the network, network
elements, links and the planned date of the beginning of the operation of public communication networks or
the provision of public communication services.


-----

Within seven days from receipt of the complete notification, AKOS registers the operator in its official register
and submits a confirmation notice to the operator (such confirmation is not an administrative decision and
does not itself create rights and obligations under the ZEKom-1).

Foreign operators that wish to acquire the status of an operator have two options: they can either establish a
subsidiary in Slovenia or acquire a Slovenian tax number.

_Required Notifications_

An operator must notify AKOS about:

- changes to the company’s name, address or headquarters, legal representatives, network or services; AKOS
must be notified about these changes within 30 days from their occurrence;

- changes to the starting date of the operation of public communication networks or the provision of public
communication services or changes to the geographic area in which the network is operated or the services
are provided; AKOS must be notified about these changes prior to their occurrence; and

- the termination of the operation of public communication networks or the termination of the provision of
public communication services; AKOS must be informed in writing and at least 90 days prior to the planned
termination.

_Annual Fee_

All operators must pay an annual fee to AKOS. The amount of the annual fee under the ZEKom-1 is based on
the operator’s revenue that results from the provision of public communication networks or public
communication services and is calculated by AKOS. In its decision, the Slovenian Constitutional Court ruled
that basing the calculation of the annual fee on revenue is unconstitutional.

_Radio Frequency Spectrum_

On the basis of a public tender AKOS, issues decisions on the award of radio frequencies for provision of
public communication services to end-users. AKOS issues the decision on award of radio frequencies for a
limited time period, taking into account appropriate time for amortization of investment, however not longer
than 15 years. The validity of a decision on award of radio frequencies for provision of public communication
services to end-users may not be prolonged. The holder of the decision on award of radio frequencies may
transfer its right to use such radio frequency to a third-party with a prior consent of AKOS.

Operators may not accumulate radio frequencies with the objective of limiting competition on the radio
communication market. Such accumulation may be established by the fact that the operator is not using the
radio frequency as determined under the award decision or if it is otherwise apparent from the operator’s
actions that it acquired the radio frequency with the purpose of limiting competition on the market.

AKOS may ex officio change the decision on award of radio frequency in order to ensure effective use of
radio frequency spectrum for the public good or for certain other causes as prescribed by law. AKOS may,
among other things, annul the decision of awarding radio frequency if the award was acquired on the basis of
untrue data, if the holder no longer complies with the requirements laid down in the relevant legislation or the
decision itself, does not begin to use the radio frequency within the prescribed time period, transfers the right
to a third-party, or if the fee for the use of radio frequency or the fee for effective use of finite commodity have
not been paid.

The holder of a decision on award of radio frequency must pay an annual usage fee to AKOS. The amount of
the annual fee is based on the coverage and density of population; however, it may not restrict or hinder
competition or market entry. In order to ensure optimal use of radio frequencies, holders of decisions on
award of radio frequencies for provision of public communication services must also pay a fee for effective use
of finite commodity. The minimal amount of such payment and terms of payment shall be determined in the
decision on the initiation of the public tender procedure on the basis of demand for tendered frequencies,
development of the market or amount of payment in other EU member states. The fee should not, however,
unduly hinder the provision of innovative services and competition.

_Numbering Plan_

AKOS adopts the numbering plan with a general act that determines the type, length, and structure of the
numbering elements, their intended use, and manner of use, including numbers for emergency calls and


-----

numbers the use of which is harmonized based on EU regulations. This general act must also support number
portability and the introduction of new electronic communication services.

The operator’s application for the allocation of numbering elements must include:

- the company’s name and address, its VAT identification number and the name of its legal representatives;

- evidence that the company has the right to be allocated numbering elements;

- data on the type and quantity of the numbering elements it wishes to acquire and their intended use;

- a project plan and an assessment of needs for the following three years, if the applicant requires a larger
block of numbering elements; and

- justifications on the basis of which the applicant proves that it will use the allocated quantity of numbering
elements in three years.

AKOS must reach a decision on the allocation of numbering elements within 21 days from the beginning of
the proceedings, provided that a public tender was not carried out. AKOS uses a public invitation to tender
procedure only when it is established that efficient use of specific numbering elements (e.g., short numbers)
can only be ensured by restricting the number of decisions issued allocating numbering elements. Operators
that may allocate the numbering elements they acquire for use to their users under equal, cost oriented and
transparent conditions may take part in a public invitation to tender procedure. Other natural person or legal
entities may only take part if they can prove that they require numbering resources in order to perform an
activity for the public benefit under the relevant legislation or EU regulations. AKOS shall decide on tenders
by issuing one or more decisions on allocation of numbering elements, which it must in this case issue and
deliver within 42 days of the expiry of the deadline for the submission of tenders.

A holder of a decision on allocation of numbering elements must pay an annual fee to AKOS. The amount of
the annual fee is based on quantity, length and type of numbering elements; however the amount should not
restrict or hinder competition or market entry. Additionally, in the case of numbering elements awarded on
the basis of a public tender, payment of a fee for effective use of a finite commodity is also required. The
minimal amount of such payment and terms of payment shall be determined in the decision on the initiation
of the public tender procedure.

_Operators with Significant Market Power_

To prevent operators with significant market power (“OSMP”) from potentially abusing their market power
on a relevant market (in particular, the market for public communication networks and the market for public
communication services), AKOS may issue decisions designating operators as OSMPs and impose on them
suitable measures or regulatory obligations (ex-ante regulation). The purpose of these measures is to regulate
the relevant OSMP’s actions vis à vis other operators. The measures or obligations that may be imposed on an
OSMP are set forth in ZEKom-1 and include the obligation to ensure transparency and equal treatment, the
obligation to ensure operator access to and the use of specific network facilities, price control and cost
accounting obligations, the obligation to separate accounting records, the obligation to regulate retail services,
etc. The most severe measure envisaged by ZEKom-1 is a functional separation, which means that a vertically
integrated OSMP must perform its activities related to operator access in a separate and independent business
unit.

Under ZEKom-1, an operator is deemed to have significant market power if it itself or together with other
undertakings on a relevant market holds a dominant position, i.e., such economic influence as to enable it to
exercise a considerable degree of independence in respect of its competitors, users and consumers. In assessing
whether an operator has significant market power AKOS, among other things, considers the following criteria:

- the market share of the operator on the relevant market and the variation of its market share on the relevant
market over a longer period of time;

- the existence of barriers to entry and their effect on the potential competition on that market;

- the impact of large users on the power of the operator (countervailing purchasing power);

- the elasticity of demand;

- the stage of development of the relevant market;

- technological advantages;

- the development of sales and distribution networks;


-----

- the achievement of scale or economies of integration;

- the level of vertical integration;

- the level of product differentiation;

- the possibility of access to financial resources;

- the control of infrastructure that may not easily be duplicated; and

- the interconnection of services.

The relevant markets are determined by AKOS taking into account principles of competition law and taking
into account the valid European Commission recommendation on relevant product and service markets. The
relevant markets listed in the valid European Commission recommendation of October 9, 2014 on relevant
product and service markets within the electronic communications sector susceptible to ex-ante regulation in
accordance with Directive 2002/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the European Council on a
common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services (2014/710/EU) are:

Market 1: Wholesale call termination on individual public telephone networks provided at a fixed
location;
Market 2: Wholesale voice call termination on individual mobile networks;
Market 3a: Wholesale local access provided at a fixed location;
Market 3b: Wholesale central access provided at a fixed location for mass market products; and
Market 4: Wholesale high-quality access provided at a fixed location.

In December 2020, the European Commission adopted a revised version of the recommendation on relevant
product and service markets within the electronic communications sector susceptible to ex-ante regulation,
replacing the European Commission recommendation on relevant products and service markets of October 9,
2014, as required by the European Electronic Communications Code. The new recommendation sets out a
revised list of markets, which still warrant ex-ante regulation at the EU level, including two wholesale
connectivity markets, i.e., Market 1: Wholesale local access provided at a fixed location and Market 2:
Wholesale dedicated capacity. Other (previously listed as recommended) markets for wholesale central access
as well as fixed and mobile voice call termination (listed in the preceding paragraph as Market 1, Market 2
and Market 3b) are no longer listed as markets susceptible to ex-ante regulation, however national regulatory
authorities can always regulate these markets based on national circumstances and provided that the following
test is met: (i) high and non-transitory barriers to entry, (ii) a structure that does not tend towards effective
competition and (iii) competition law alone is insufficient to adequately address the identified market failures.
It has not yet been publicly disclosed whether AKOS will impose ex-ante regulation measures only on the two
listed markets, but we have received unofficial indication that AKOS intends to continue imposing ex-ante
regulation on other markets as well.

_Media Act_

The Media Act (Zakon o medijih—ZMed), which came into force on May 26, 2001 (as amended), prohibits a
telecommunications operator from carrying out activities of a TV or radio broadcaster or advertiser, unless it
has obtained an approval to perform TV and/or radio broadcasting activities from AKOS. In practice this
means that entities engaging in telecommunication operations and entities carrying out activities of a TV or
radio broadcaster or advertiser must be structurally separated (but may be under common control).

**_Serbia_**

_General_

Under the Serbian Electronic Communication Act (“ECA”), the main piece of legislation regulating the
performance of electronic communication activities and the operation of the networks thereof in Serbia, a
company’s general authorization to conduct its business is in most cases sufficient to provide electronic
communication services. A sector-specific license is required only if the business involves the exploitation of
scarce resources, such as phone numbers or radio frequencies. Therefore, when a company takes up an activity
under the general authorization regime, all it needs to do (subject to fulfillment of the imposed general
conditions (technical and certain others) and payment of the prescribed fees) is to notify RATEL within
15-days of doing so. In addition, the company is required to act in compliance with general conditions during
its operations and to notify RATEL of any important changes in its activities, as well as of their termination.


-----

_Significant Market Power Under the ECA_

Under the ECA, an operator is considered to have significant market power (“SMP”), if it has, alone or
together with other operators, a dominant position, i.e., a position that enables it to a significant degree to act
independently from its competitors, subscribers and customers. Pursuant to the ECA, if RATEL finds the
absence of effective competition in a relevant market (and a closely related market), it will designate the
operator who, individually or jointly with other operators, has SMP on that market, by taking into account
different market conditions.

If RATEL reaches a decision designating one or more operators as having SMP, RATEL may impose at least
one of the following obligations on the respective entities:

- an obligation to publish data from accounting records, technical specifications, network characteristics,
terms and conditions for supply and use or validity periods of the offer and prices;

- an obligation to only engage in non-discriminatory conduct;

- an obligation to keep separate accounts for interconnection and access services;

- an obligation to provide access and use of parts of its network infrastructure and associated facilities to
third parties;

- price controls and cost-based accounting;

- an obligation to make available a minimum set of leased lines;

- an obligation to offer operator selection and operator pre-selection services; and

- regulation of the respective operators’ retail services, including an obligation to unbundle products and
services.

_Tariffs_

As a general matter, each operator is free to set its own tariffs. However, if RATEL finds an operator to have
SMP in a relevant market, the operator may become subject to various restrictions, including price controls,
as noted above. If an operator becomes subject to price controls, it must adopt a cost based accounting system
for the provision of specific types of interconnection and/or access services. These controls are imposed if, in
particular, RATEL determines that the absence of effective competition enables the operator to charge
exceedingly high prices or resort to price squeezes to the detriment of end-users.

While RATEL has some flexibility in imposing these restrictions, it must take into consideration the previous
investments made by the operator while imposing the aforesaid measures, it must encourage further
investments and it must allow for a reasonable rate of return on investment in view of the risks involved.

The burden of proof that an operator’s prices comply with the above-mentioned restrictions is on the relevant
operator. Upon RATEL’s request, the operator in question is required to provide a detailed account of its
pricing policy.

A description of the operator’s price calculations must be made publicly available and reviewed annually by
an independent auditor.

_Law on Electronic Media_

Provision of audiovisual media services via electronic communication networks is subject to a license by the
media regulator REM. Such license is valid for a period of eight calendar years and may be extended. In order
to extend the term of the license, the licensee must submit a request for the extension of the license at least
six months before its expiration. The holder of the license must notify REM of any change in its direct or
indirect ownership structure for REM’s verification as to whether the change of control may lead to violation
of the rules on media concentration (concentration of ownership or management rights in two or more
electronic media publishers, or acquisition of more than 50% of share of daily news publishers with circulation
of more than 50,000 copies annually, and audio and AVM service providers). Failure to abide by media
concentration rules may lead to license revocation.

**_Bosnia and Herzegovina_**

_Telecommunications Services_

The Bosnian Law on Communications regulates telecommunications, radio, broadcasting (including cable
television) and associated services and facilities in Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as the establishment and
the activities of the Bosnian Communications Regulatory Agency (“CRA”).


-----

The CRA was established on March 2, 2001 and assumed the competences of the Independent Media
Commission and the Telecommunications Regulatory Agency. The CRA is responsible for developing rules
in the telecommunications and broadcasting sectors, the licensing of operators in these sectors, the planning,
management and allocation of the frequency spectrum, the implementation of technical and quality standards
and the determination and maintenance of license fees.

Telecommunications services through fixed-line and mobile networks or internet services may only be offered
if the relevant operator holds a license. A telecommunications operator is required to:

- enter into written subscription contracts with its subscribers;

- provide (free of charge) a brief and plain summary of the tariffs applicable to its subscribers;

- deliver, at the request of the CRA, within a reasonable period of time, business data, network data and
traffic data including confidential data;

- ensure the proper functioning and good working condition of its system and the timely removal of
interferences and failures and notify the CRA without any undue delay of any significant interruption in
the telecommunications connections;

- set up conditions of operation, a description of services and specify the relevant tariffs, all of which must be
presented to the CRA and published in a suitable form; the operator must also publish any changes to the
conditions of operations and tariffs at least one month prior to their effective date in a suitable form; any
change to the content of a contract entitles the contracting party to terminate its contract with the
telecommunications operator within a period of four weeks from the publication of the change; and

- offer interconnection services to other operators upon their request; if the relevant parties cannot reach an
agreement within a period of six weeks from receipt of the request, each of them may petition the CRA to
mediate the dispute.

The CRA decides upon the grant of a telecommunications license within two months of receiving an
appropriate application. In the event of competitive or comparative selection procedures the CRA may extend
the evaluation period for up to four months to ensure that such procedures are fair, reasonable, open, nondiscriminatory and transparent to all interested parties. The CRA will grant a license if the applicant possesses
the necessary technical competence and if there is no reason to assume that the applicant will not provide the
relevant services in accordance with the license, in particular as regards quality and supply. In reaching its
decision, the CRA takes into consideration the applicant’s financial strength, its experience in the
telecommunications sector and related sectors as well as its relevant expertise. A licensee may transfer its
license in whole or in part only with the consent of the CRA, which defines the conditions for the transfer of
the license.

_Operators with Significant Market Power_

A telecommunications operator with significant market power must allow third parties to access its public
telecommunications network or unbundled parts of such network. The obligation related to interconnection
does not apply if the CRA determines, based on evidence provided by the telecommunications operator, that
it would be inappropriate to require the operator to open its network. A telecommunications operator with
significant market power requires the CRA’s approval to provide (i) voice telephony services via a fixed-line or
mobile network and (ii) leased lines. In addition, a telecommunications operator with significant market
power in the telecommunications market is required to provide to its competitors open and non-discriminatory
access to its services, establish a cost accounting system that assigns costs to all of its services and permits
subsequent audits of this system in compliance with the CRA rules and the provisions set out in the licenses,
and provide a minimum set of lines for lease to third parties. Such an operator is also prohibited from cross
subsidizing services and is subject to accounting separation of interconnection activities.

In addition, a provider of public fixed-line telephony services that has been designated as an operator of
telecommunications with significant market power on the market of fixed-line public telephony services must
enable unbundled access to the local loop and related facilities on the basis of the following principles:
objectivity, transparency, non-discrimination and cost orientation and is subject to price control.

_Audiovisual Media Services_

The provision of audiovisual media services is subject to a license by the CRA. Such services must be provided
on a non-discriminatory basis and in accordance with the law and the terms of the license. A licensee may not
restrict access to subscribers based on their nationality, religious beliefs, financial strength or any other


-----

grounds nor is it entitled to make a selection of programs in a manner that favors the interests of only one
national or religious community in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The licensee is required to offer the services to all
citizens in the technical coverage zone and each person that accepts the single and non-discriminatory
conditions is entitled to enter into a subscription contract. Prior to the inclusion of any audiovisual media
service or a radio media service into a service package, the licensee is required to obtain written consents from
the owners of the program content or their authorized representatives. The distribution of such services
cannot be launched before the relevant consents have been obtained.

A license for the provision of audiovisual media services is valid for a period of ten calendar years and may be
extended. In order to extend the term of the license, the licensee must submit a request for extension of the
license at least three-months before its expiration.

_General_

Following the occurrence of certain change of control events, each holder of Existing Notes will have the
right to require United Group B.V. to repurchase all or a portion of that holder’s Existing Notes at a purchase
price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Existing Notes repurchased, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and certain additional amounts, if any, on the Existing Notes repurchased to the date of
purchase, unless such Notes are redeemed.

In connection with certain tender offers or offers to purchase all of a series of the Existing Notes (except that
this provision only applies to the Existing 2024 SSNs in connection with a Change of Control Offer (as


-----

defined in the 2017 Indenture)), in the event that holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal
amount of the applicable series of the then outstanding Existing Notes validly tender and do not validly
withdraw such Existing Notes in such tender offer or offer to purchase the Issuer will have the right to redeem
all (but not less than all) of such series of the Existing Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase
at a redemption price in cash equal to the price offered to other holders (or, in the case of the Existing 2024
SSNs, 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Existing 2024 SSNs), plus accrued and unpaid interest,
if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the date of such redemption.

In addition, in the event that United Group B.V. or any Guarantor becomes obligated to pay Additional
Amounts (as defined in the applicable Indentures) to holders of the applicable series of Existing Notes as a
result of certain changes affecting taxes applicable to payments on the applicable series of Existing Notes, it
may redeem the applicable series of Existing Notes in whole but not in part at any time at 100% of the
principal amount of the applicable series of Existing Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption
date.

**_Covenants_**

The Indentures contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Company and its
subsidiaries to:

- incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;

- layer debt;

- make restricted payments, including dividends or other distributions;

- prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity;

- make certain investments;

- create or permit to exist certain liens;

- transfer, lease or sell certain assets;

- enter into arrangements that impose restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or make
other payments;

- engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

- consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis;

- impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the applicable series of Existing Notes; and

- amend certain documents.

These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions.

**_Events of Default_**

The Indentures contain customary events of default, including, among others, the non-payment of principal
or interest on the applicable series of Existing Notes, certain failures to perform or observe any other
obligation under the Indentures or the security documents, as applicable, the failure to pay certain principal
amounts of indebtedness when due or judgments and the bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company, the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that constitute individually, or taken
together as a group would constitute, a Significant Subsidiary (as defined Indentures, as applicable). The
occurrence of any of the events of default would permit or result in the acceleration of all obligations
outstanding under such Existing Notes.

**Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement**

**_Overview and Structure_**

On July 13, 2017, the Parent and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a super senior revolving credit facility
agreement (the “Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement”) with, among others, UniCredit Bank AG,
London Branch as facility agent, UniCredit Bank AG, London Branch as English security agent, UniCredit
Bank Serbia JSC Belgrade as Serbian security agent, UniCredit Bank Serbia JSC Belgrade as payment agent
and the financial institutions named therein as arrangers and lenders. In connection with the 2019


-----

Refinancing, pursuant to an additional facility notice dated May 3, 2019, the Company received additional
commitments from certain Existing Revolving Credit Facility Lenders in an aggregate amount equal to €
100 million in relation to the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, increasing the commitments under the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility from €100 million to €200 million with effect from May 14, 2019. Pursuant
to an amendment and restatement agreement to the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement dated 31
July 2020 (with an effective date of 5 August 2020), among other things, (a) the maturity of the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility was extended to July 15, 2025 (with such maturity automatically being reduced to
(i) February 1, 2024, if the Existing 2024 SSNs are not fully refinanced by such date or (ii) February 15, 2025,
if the Existing Floating Rate Notes are not fully refinanced by such date) and (b) the commitments under the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement were increased to €250. On or about the Issue Date, the
Company expects to receive additional commitments from certain lenders in respect of the Existing Revolving
Credit Facility in an aggregate amount up to €75 million, increasing the total commitments under the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility from €250 million to up to €325 million, in connection with the Existing Revolving
Credit Facility 2021 Increase. The facilities under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement are
referred to as the “Existing Revolving Credit Facility.”

The Existing Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized by any current or future borrower thereunder in euros,
U.S. dollars and (other than in respect of loans by a Serbian Lender (as defined below)), Sterling or any other
currency which is readily available and freely convertible into euro, by the drawing of cash advances, the
issuance of letters of credit, bank guarantees and/or the establishment of ancillary facilities. The Existing
Revolving Credit Facility may be used for (directly or indirectly) financing or refinancing the general corporate
purposes and/or working capital requirements of the Group (including, for the avoidance of doubt, capital
expenditure and/or acquisitions).

In addition to the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
includes the ability to incur additional facilities either as new facilities or additional tranches of the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility subject to certain conditions being met.

Due to Serbian foreign exchange regulations and the National Bank of Serbia registration requirements, the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for (i) loans to borrowers incorporated in Serbia (or
its affiliates) (“Serbian Borrowers”) to be made only by a bank duly incorporated under the Serbian banking
and company laws and lending out of an office in Serbia (“Serbian Lender”) and (ii) loans to borrowers which
are not Serbian Borrowers to be made only by banks or entities which are not Serbian Lenders. Payments
between such Serbian Lenders and Serbian Borrowers shall be made through a payment agent.

The final maturity date of the Existing Revolving Credit Facility following the Existing Revolving Credit
Facility Extension and 2020 Increase is July 15, 2025 (with such maturity automatically being reduced to
(i) February 1, 2024, if the Existing 2024 SSNs are not fully refinanced by such date or (ii) February 15, 2025,
if the Existing Floating Rate Notes are not fully refinanced by such date) (the “Maturity Date”), and the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized until the date falling one month prior to the Maturity Date.

**_Interest and Fees_**

Loans under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will initially bear interest at rates per annum
equal to LIBOR or, for loans denominated in euro, EURIBOR, plus a margin of 3.50% per annum (which is
subject to reduction in accordance with a ratchet linked to the leverage ratio). Loans made by a Serbian
Lender to a Serbian Borrower will bear an additional margin of 1.10% per annum.

A commitment fee is payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the Existing Revolving
Credit Facility until the end of the availability period for the Existing Revolving Credit Facility at a rate of
35% of the margin applicable to the Existing Revolving Credit Facility from time to time. Default interest is
calculated as an additional 1% on the overdue amount.

**_Guarantees and Security_**

The Existing Revolving Credit Facility is required to be guaranteed by each Material Subsidiary (defined to
include any member of the Group with more than 5% of the consolidated EBITDA calculated on a last
twelve months basis or gross assets of the Group) and additional members of the Group required to ensure
that guarantors represent at least 80% of the consolidated EBITDA of the Group calculated on a last
twelve months basis and 80% of the gross assets of the Group subject to and in accordance with the agreed
security principles set out in the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.


-----

The Existing Revolving Credit Facility is secured by certain material assets of such guarantors subject to and
in accordance with the agreed security principles set out in the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

The agreed security principles in the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provide that certain assets
will not be pledged (or the liens not perfected):

- if providing such security would be prohibited by general statutory limitations, financial assistance, capital
maintenance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, “earnings stripping,” “controlled foreign
corporation” or “thin capitalization” rules, tax restrictions, retention of title claims and similar matters or
providing security would be outside the applicable pledgor’s capacity or conflict with fiduciary duties of
directors or cause material risk of personal or criminal liability after the use of reasonable endeavors to
overcome such obstacle;

- if the cost of providing security is not proportionate to the benefit accruing to the lenders;

- if there is material incremental cost involved in creating security over all assets of the entity in question (the
“Relevant Entity”) in a particular category of assets, only the material assets in that category will be subject
to security;

- if certain security may be provided by the Relevant Entity granting a promise to pledge coupled with an
irrevocable power of attorney as opposed to a definitive legal mortgage or pledge over the relevant asset;

- if it is expressly acknowledged that it may be either impossible or impractical to create security over certain
categories of assets, security will not be taken over such assets;

- if providing such security requires consent before such assets may be secured or where providing such
security would give a third-party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or
obligations of the borrower, guarantors or any of its subsidiaries in respect of those assets or require any of
them to take any action materially adverse to their interests and where (subject to certain conditions being
met) such consent cannot be obtained after the use of reasonable endeavors;

- if providing such security would have a material adverse effect (as reasonably determined in good faith by
such subsidiary) on the ability of such subsidiary to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary
course as otherwise permitted by the indenture and any requirement under the agreed security principles to
seek consent of any person or take or not take any other action shall be subject to this principle;

- if the aggregate of notarial costs and all registration and like taxes relating to the provision of security
exceeds an agreed amount;

- if the assets are, or the relevant member of the Group is, located outside the security jurisdictions, which are
Croatia, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Netherlands and Luxembourg;

- in the case of security from or over, or over assets of, any joint venture or similar arrangement, any minority
interest or any entity that is not wholly-owned; and

- in the case of assets subject to security in favor of a third-party.

**_Representations and Warranties_**

The Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties
(subject to customary qualifications and with certain representations and warranties being repeated).

**_Covenants_**

The Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain of the incurrence covenants and related
definitions (with certain adjustments) that are set forth in the indenture governing the Existing Notes. In
addition, the Existing Revolving Facility Agreement requires the Group to comply with a springing financial
covenant consisting of a maximum Leverage Ratio.

**_Events of Default_**

The Existing Revolving Credit Facility contains events of default which are, with certain adjustments, the
same as those applicable to the New Notes and set forth in the section entitled “Description of the New
_Notes—Events of Default.” These events of default (which are subject to certain materiality exceptions and_
cure periods) entitle the Majority Lenders (as defined therein) to accelerate all or part of the utilization and
terminate their commitments and to enforce the guarantees and security under or in relation to the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility.


-----

**Bilateral Facilities**

From time to time, we enter into bilateral facilities with certain of our local lenders. Following the United
Group Acquisition, the following bilateral facilities have remained in place.

**_Serbian Revolving Facility—€20,000,000_**

SBB Serbia entered into a €20 million Serbian law governed revolving credit facility agreement (the
“€20 million Serbian Revolving Credit Facility Agreement”) dated May 9, 2016 and as amended on March 7,
2017, January 28, 2019 and September 9, 2020 (and as amended and/or amended and restated from time to
time) with Raiffeisen banka a.d. Beograd (“Raiffeisen”). As support for this loan, SBB Serbia delivered to
Raiffeisen five blank bills of exchange accompanied by authorizations for collecting under these bills of
exchange. Pursuant to the loan agreement, the Company also issued a corporate guarantee in the amount of
€20 million which covers SBB Serbia’s liabilities towards Raiffeisen which will remain valid until the full
settlement of all of SBB Serbia’s obligations under the loan agreement. The loan provides for additional
support to be delivered upon request.

The revolving facility made available pursuant to the €20 million Serbian Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
(the “€20 million Serbian Revolving Credit Facility”) may be utilized either in foreign currency or in euro (or
in the Serbian dinar equivalent of euro). The € 20 million Serbian Revolving Credit Facility may be used for
the financing of general corporate and working capital purposes. The €20 million Serbian Revolving Credit
Facility’s maturity date is September 29, 2023, upon which date SBB Serbia is required to repay the loan in full
by way of a bullet payment.

Loans under the €20 million Serbian Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to
one month EURIBOR plus a margin of 2.45%, or at a rate per annum equal to one month BELIBOR plus a
margin of 1.2%. The election between fixed and variable interest rate is to be specified by the SBB Serbia in
each drawdown notice. Interest is payable monthly.

The €20 million Serbian Revolving Credit Facility Agreement allows for voluntary repayments of outstanding
borrowings subject to the delivery of a prepayment notice three business days prior to the date of such
repayment. A prepayment fee of 1% of the prepayment amount applies if the requisite prepayment notice is
not provided.

The €20 million Serbian Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain customary representations
(subject to certain exceptions and qualifications and with certain representations being repeated), including,
but not limited to, status and incorporation, capacity and authority, authorizations, consents and third-party
claims and provides for certain customary events of default including cross defaults.

The €20 million Serbian Revolving Credit Facility Agreement requires SBB Serbia to maintain certain bank
accounts in specified currencies. SBB Serbia is also required, among other things, to provide annual reports;
allow access to its business books following a request from Raiffeisen; allow representatives of Raiffeisen to
perform specified control procedures with respect to any utilization of the €20 million Serbian Revolving
Credit Facility in order to determine whether it has been used for intended purposes; and to comply with
certain intercompany subordination obligations.

Without the prior consent of Raiffeisen, SBB Serbia is restricted from, among other things, entering into any
other loan facility, creating any encumbrance on its present or future assets in Serbia, changing (directly or
indirectly) its existing ownership structure and acquiring stakes or shares in other companies.

**_UniCredit Facility—€10,000,000_**

SBB Serbia entered into a €10 million facility with UniCredit Bank Serbia JSC Belgrade on January 24, 2019
(the “UniCredit Revolving Credit Facility”). This facility is available as a revolving line and is approved in
euros, however payment and repayment may be made in Euros (in cases permitted under applicable FX
regulations) or in Serbian dinars in which case applying the middle exchange rate of the National Bank of
Serbia on the date of payment or repayment, as applicable. Credit under the facility will be available until
January 23, 2022. The availability period may be extended based on written application made 15-days prior
the expiration of the facility agreement. If the extension is approved, SBB Serbia is obligated to pay a fee of
0.10% of the entire amount under the facility agreement.

This facility may be used for general corporate purposes including working capital financing and mergers and
acquisitions. As security under this facility agreement, SBB Serbia provided five signed blank bills of exchange


-----

and a corporate guarantee issued in favor of UniCredit Bank Serbia JSC Belgrade by Adria Midco. The
interest rate of this facility is equal to the six month Euribor rate plus 2.50% per annum paid monthly. SBB

(b) over any charged property subject to Relevant Original Transaction Security to secure any New Debt
Financing,

it being understood that the Secured Parties which are beneficiaries of Supplemental Security will have all the
rights of a Secured Party under the Intercreditor Agreement (including under the provisions set out under the
caption “—Application of Proceeds”) regardless of the ranking of the security stated in the Security Document
creating the Supplemental Security or the chronological order in which such security is granted.

**_Debt Refinancing_**

The Intercreditor Agreement permits any of the liabilities under the debt documents to be refinanced,
replaced, increased or otherwise restructured in whole or in part including by way of Permitted Senior
Financing Debt, Second Lien Debt, Permitted Second Lien Financing Debt and/or Permitted Parent
Financing Debt or the issue of additional Senior Notes and the introduction of a “super senior”credit facility
(the “Priority Facility”) or the establishment of new or additional Operating Facilities (each a “Debt
Refinancing”).

Each party to the Intercreditor Agreement shall be required to enter into any amendment to or replacement
of the then current Secured Debt Documents and/or take such other action as is required by the Parent in
order to facilitate such a Debt Refinancing including changes to, the taking of, or release and retake of any
guarantee or security, subject to certain conditions. At the option of the Parent, a Debt Refinancing may be
made available on a basis which is senior to, pari passu with or junior to any of the other liabilities, shall be
entitled to benefit from all or any of the security, may be made available on a secured or unsecured basis
(subject to certain restrictions) and may be effected in whole or in part by way of a debt exchange, non-cash
rollover or other similar or equivalent transaction, in each case unless otherwise prohibited by the Debt
Financing Agreements.

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement each agent, each Secured Party and each Primary Creditor
agrees that it shall co-operate with the Parent, each other member of the Group and each agent in order to
facilitate any Debt Refinancing (including by way of, at the request and cost of the Parent, executing any
document or agreement and/or giving instructions to any person).


-----

In the event of any refinancing or replacement of all or any part of the Senior Lender Liabilities (or any such
refinancing or replacement indebtedness from time to time), the Parent shall be entitled to require that the
definition of Instructing Group (as defined herein) is amended such that the relevant refinancing or
replacement indebtedness is treated in the same manner as the Senior Facilities (meaning that for the purpose
of calculating the voting entitlement of any person, at the option of the Parent all or any part of the relevant
refinancing or replacement indebtedness may be treated as Senior Secured Credit Participations of the Senior
Creditors and not Senior Notes/Permitted Financing Credit Participations).

In the event that any Priority Facility becomes subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the
Parent shall be entitled to require that all or any part of the liabilities in relation to Hedging Liabilities and/or
the Operating Facility Liabilities shall rank in right and priority of payment pari passu with that Priority
Facility (which, for the avoidance of doubt, may result in such Hedging Liabilities and/or, as the case may be,
Operating Facility Liabilities ranking ahead of the Senior Notes liabilities, the Permitted Senior Financing
Liabilities, the Senior Parent Notes Liabilities and/or the Permitted Parent Financing Liabilities) in each case
unless otherwise prohibited by the Debt Financing Agreements.

Any Priority Facility implemented pursuant to a Debt Refinancing shall comply with, among others, the
following limitations:

_Ranking of a Priority Facility_

No liabilities or obligations in respect of any Priority Facility may rank in right and priority of payment
ahead of the Senior Lender Liabilities (other than amounts of the type set out in paragraphs (i) and (ii) under
the caption “—Application of Proceeds.”).

Subject to the paragraph above and to the extent not otherwise prohibited by the Debt Financing Agreements,
any Priority Facility shall rank in right and priority of payment as determined by the Parent.

_Enforcement: Priority Facility_

The right of the lenders or other creditors in respect of a Priority Facility to:

(a) instruct the Security Agent to enforce the security;

(b) give or refrain from giving instructions to the Security Agent to enforce or refrain from enforcing the
security as they see fit; and/or

(c) otherwise provide instructions as, or as part of, an Instructing Group,

shall be generally consistent with, or otherwise not materially less favorable to the other Secured Parties than,
those customary for facilities of a similar nature to that Priority Facility (if any), in each case as at the date
such Priority Facility is contractually committed by the relevant member(s) of the Group and as determined
by the Parent (with any such determination to be conclusive).

_Option to Purchase_

(a) The Senior Notes Creditors and the Permitted Senior Financing Creditors shall be provided with an
‘option to purchase’ right in relation to any liabilities in respect of a Priority Facility consistent in all
material respects with the ‘option to purchase’ right provided in relation to the Senior Lender Liabilities
as set out under the caption “—Restrictions Relating to Senior Secured Liabilities—Option to Purchase:
_Senior Notes Creditors and Permitted Senior Financing Creditors.”_

(b) The Senior Parent Notes Trustee and any Senior Parent Creditor Representative(s) shall be provided
with an ‘option to purchase’right in relation to any liabilities in respect of a Priority Facility consistent in
all material respects with the ‘option to purchase’ right as set out under the paragraph captioned
“—Permitted Senior Parent Enforcement—Option to Purchase: Senior Parent Creditors.”

_Supplemental Security_

Without prejudice to the provisions set out under the caption “—Ranking and Priority”and “—Application of
_Proceeds” and the other rights of the Debtors under the Intercreditor Agreement and the debt documents, if_
any member of the Group enters into any hedging agreement or Operating Facility Document at any time
after the date of the Intercreditor Agreement (which is not already secured by the Relevant Original
Transaction Security), any Debtor may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, at any time grant


-----

to the relevant Hedge Counterparty or, as the case may be, Operating Facility Lender Supplemental Security
securing all or any Hedging Liabilities arising under the relevant hedging agreement or, as the case may be, all
or any Operating Facility Liabilities arising under the relevant Operating Facility Document. A Debtor may
grant Supplemental Security to any secured creditor in connection with all or any part of any New Debt
Financing.

The Relevant Original Transaction Security Beneficiaries agree that Supplemental Security may be granted by
any Debtor in order to secure all or any part of any Hedging Liabilities, any Operating Facility Liabilities
and/or any New Debt Financing.

For the avoidance of doubt, nothing set out this caption shall:

(a) restrict the rights of the Relevant Original Transaction Security Beneficiaries to enforce and/or to release
all or any part of the Relevant Original Transaction Security in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement and the other Debt Documents; or

(b) restrict, limit or prejudice the rights and other benefits of the Debtors or any member of the Group
under the Intercreditor Agreement or any other Debt Document.

Each of the Secured Parties agrees not to take any action to challenge the validity or enforceability of the
Supplemental Security by reason of it being expressed to be second ranking (or any other lower ranking).

**_Ranking and Priority_**

_Priority of Debts_

Subject to the provisions set out under the caption “—Senior Parent Liabilities and Security” below, the
Intercreditor Agreement provides that the liabilities owed by the Debtors (other than any Senior Parent Debt
Issuer to the extent relating to liabilities in respect of Senior Parent Notes and/or Permitted Parent Financing
Debt where that Senior Parent Debt Issuer is the issuer or the borrower) to the Primary Creditors and the
Operating Facility Lenders shall rank in right and priority of payment in the following order and are
postponed and subordinated to any prior ranking liabilities as follows:

(a) _first, the Senior Lender Liabilities, the Senior Notes Liabilities, the Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities,_
the Hedging Liabilities, the Operating Facility Liabilities, the Second Lien Lender Liabilities, the
Permitted Second Lien Financing Liabilities, the Senior Arranger Liabilities, the Second Lien Arranger
Liabilities, the Senior Agent Liabilities, amounts due to the Senior Notes Trustee, the Second Lien Agent
Liabilities and amounts due to the Senior Parent Notes Trustee pari passu and without any preference
amongst them; and

(b) second, the Senior Parent Notes Liabilities and the Permitted Parent Financing Liabilities pari passu and
without any preference amongst them,

The liabilities owed by any Senior Parent Debt Issuer (to the extent relating to Liabilities in respect of Senior
Parent Notes and/or Permitted Parent Financing Debt where that Senior Parent Debt Issuer is the issuer or
the borrower) to the Primary Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders shall rank pari passu in right and
priority of payment without any preference amongst them.

_Priority of Security_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the security shall secure the liabilities (but only to the extent that
such security is expressed to secure those liabilities) in the following order:

(a) _first, the Senior Lender Liabilities, the Senior Notes Liabilities, the Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities,_
the Hedging Liabilities, the Operating Facility Liabilities, the Senior Arranger Liabilities, the Senior
Agent Liabilities, amounts due to the Senior Notes Trustee, the Second Lien Agent Liabilities and
amounts due to the Senior Parent Notes Trustee pari passu and without any preference amongst them;

(b) second, the Second Lien Lender Liabilities, the Permitted Second Lien Financing Liabilities and the
Second Lien Arranger Liabilities pari passu and without any preference amongst them; and

(c) _third, the Senior Parent Notes Liabilities and the Permitted Parent Financing Liabilities pari passu and_
without any preference amongst them.


-----

_Senior Parent Liabilities and Security_

The Senior Parent Notes liabilities and the Permitted Parent Financing Liabilities owed by a Senior Parent
Debt Issuer (to the extent relating to Liabilities in respect of Senior Parent Notes and/or Permitted Parent
Financing Debt where that Senior Parent Debt Issuer is the issuer or, as the case may be, the borrower) are
senior obligations of that Senior Parent Debt Issuer. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Senior
Parent Notes Creditors and the Permitted Parent Financing Creditors agree that, until the First/Second Lien
Discharge Date, they may not take any steps subject to the Security Documents in connection with any
Enforcement Action, other than as expressly permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement.

For the avoidance of doubt, the restrictions set out in the preceding paragraph shall not impair the right of
the Senior Parent Creditors and/or the Permitted Parent Financing Creditors to institute suit for the recovery
of any payment due by a Senior Parent Debt Issuer in respect of the Senior Parent Liabilities and/or the
Permitted Parent Financing Liabilities (in each case to the extent relating to liabilities in respect of Senior
Parent Notes and/or Permitted Parent Financing Debt where that Senior Parent Debt Issuer is the issuer or,
as the case may be, the borrower).

_Intra-Group Liabilities and Investor Liabilities_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the intra-group liabilities and the liabilities of the Group to an
investor are postponed and subordinated to the liabilities owed by the Debtors to the Primary Creditors and
the Operating Facility Lenders, but does not purport to rank any of those liabilities as between themselves.

_Additional and/or Refinancing Debt_

The Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders acknowledge in the Intercreditor Agreement that the
Debtors (or any of them) may wish to incur incremental borrowing liabilities (including guarantees of such
liabilities) or refinance or replace borrowing liabilities (including incurring guarantee liabilities in respect of
such refinancing or replacement). Such liabilities are intended to rank pari passu with any other liabilities
and/or share pari passu in any security and/or to rank behind any other liabilities and/or to share in any
security behind any such other liabilities.

The Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders undertake in the Intercreditor Agreement (at the cost of the
Debtors) to co-operate with the Parent and the Debtors with a view to enabling and facilitating such financing,
refinancing or replacement and such sharing in the security (provided it is not prohibited by the terms of the
Debt Financing Agreements at such time) to take place in a timely manner. In particular, but without
limitation, each of the secured parties authorizes and directs each of its respective agents and the Security
Agent to execute any amendment to or replacement of the Intercreditor Agreement and such other debt
documents and/or (subject to certain pre-conditions) release and retake of security required by the Parent to
reflect, enable and/or facilitate any such arrangements (including, as regards the ranking of any such
arrangements).

If a Debtor incurs any new, additional or increased liabilities under any Secured Debt Document and/or in
connection with any Debt Refinancing, at the option of the Parent, the relevant Debtor may (but subject to
the relevant Debt Financing being elected to be secured in accordance with the applicable terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement and subject to the agreed security principles) grant to the relevant Secured Parties in
respect of all or any part of such Debt Financing additional security by executing additional security
documents which will benefit from the order of priority and ranking set out in the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Restrictions Relating to Senior Secured Liabilities_**

The Parent and the Debtors may make payments of the Senior Liabilities at any time.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Senior Secured Creditors, the Operating Facility Lenders, the
Parent and the Debtors may at any time amend or waive the terms of the finance documents in relation to the
Senior Facilities (the “Senior Facilities Finance Documents”), the Senior Notes, the Permitted Senior
Financing Debt, the Second Lien Facility (the “Second Lien Facility Finance Documents”), the Permitted
Second Lien Financing Documents and/or any Operating Facility in accordance with their respective terms
from time to time (and subject only to any consent required under them).

_Security and Guarantees: Senior Secured Creditors_

The Senior Secured Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders may take, accept or receive the benefit of:


-----

(a) any security from any member of the Group in respect of any of the Senior Liabilities in addition to the
shared security provided that, to the extent legally possible and subject to certain agreed security
principles:

(i) the security provider becomes party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Debtor (if not already a
party in that capacity);

(ii) all amounts actually received or recovered by any Senior Secured Creditor or Operating Facility
Lender with respect to any such security shall immediately be paid to the Security Agent and applied
in accordance with the provisions set out under the caption “—Application of Proceeds”; and

“—Enforcement of Security—Security Held by Other Creditors”;

(b) any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss from any member of the Group regarding any
of the Senior Liabilities in addition to those in:

(i) the Senior Facilities Agreement, any Senior Notes Indenture, any Permitted Senior Financing
Document, the Second Lien Facility Agreement, any Permitted Second Lien Financing Document
or any Operating Facility Document;

(ii) the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(iii) any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of any of the liabilities, the
benefit of which (however conferred) is, to the extent legally possible and subject to certain agreed
security principles, given to, or expressed to be given to, all the senior secured parties in respect of
their senior secured liabilities, provided that (except for any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance
against loss permitted to be given to any ancillary lender or issuing bank), to the extent legally
possible, and subject to certain agreed security principles:

(A) the guarantee provider becomes party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Debtor (if not
already a party in that capacity); and

(B) such guarantee, indemnity or assurance against loss is expressed to be subject to the
Intercreditor Agreement.

(c) any security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss from any member of the Group in
connection with:

(i) any escrow or similar or equivalent arrangements entered into in respect of amounts which are
being held (or will be held) by a person which is not a member of the Group prior to release of those
amounts to a member of the Group; or

(ii) any actual or proposed defeasance, redemption, prepayment, repayment, purchase or other
discharge of any Senior Lender Liabilities, Operating Facility Liabilities, Senior Notes liabilities,
Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities and/or Second Lien Liabilities (in each case provided that
such defeasance, redemption, prepayment, repayment, purchase or other discharge is not prohibited
by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement).

All amounts actually received or recovered by any Senior Secured Creditor or Operating Facility Lender with
respect to any such security shall immediately be paid to the Security Agent and applied in accordance with
the provisions set out under the caption “—Application of Proceeds.”

Any such Security may only be enforced in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement which
relate to security held by someone other than the Security Agent.

Any such guarantee, indemnity or assurance against loss is expressed to be subject to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

_Restriction on Enforcement: Senior Lenders, Operating Facility Lenders, Senior Notes Creditors and Permitted_
_Senior Financing Creditors_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that no Senior Lender, Operating Facility Lender, Senior Notes
Creditor or Permitted Senior Financing Creditor may take certain Enforcement Action without the prior
written consent of an Instructing Group (as defined below).


-----

Notwithstanding the above restriction or anything to the contrary in the Intercreditor Agreement, after the
occurrence of certain specified insolvency events (an “Insolvency Event”) in relation to the Parent or a Debtor,
each Senior Lender, Operating Facility Lender, Senior Notes Creditor and/or Permitted Senior Financing
Creditor may, to the extent it is permitted to do so under the relevant Debt Documents, take certain
Enforcement Action and/or claim in the winding up, dissolution, administration, reorganization or similar
insolvency event or process in relation to that Debtor for liabilities owing to it (but no Senior Secured Creditor
or Operating Facility Lender may direct the Security Agent to enforce the common security in any manner).

_Option to Purchase: Senior Notes Creditors and Permitted Senior Financing Creditors_

Senior Notes Creditors holding at least a simple majority of the Senior Notes liabilities or Permitted Senior
Financing Creditors holding at least a simple majority of the Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities (the
“Senior Secured Acquiring Creditors”) may, after the occurrence of an acceleration event which is continuing,
by giving not less than ten (10) days’ notice to the Security Agent (with the first notice to prevail in the event
that more than one set of Creditors serves such a notice), require the transfer to them (or to a nominee or
nominees), in accordance with the applicable transfer provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, of all, but
not part, of the rights, benefits and obligations in respect of the Senior Lender Liabilities and the Operating
Facility Liabilities (a “Senior Liabilities Transfer”) if:

Facilities Agreement and the Operating Facility Documents;

(ii) any conditions relating to such a transfer contained in the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Operating
Facility Documents are complied with, other than:

(viii)the Senior Parent Creditors have not exercised their rights to purchase as described under the
provisions set out in the paragraph captioned “—Option to Purchase: Senior Parent Creditors”or having
exercised such rights, have not failed to complete the acquisition of the relevant Senior Secured Liabilities
in accordance with such provisions.

Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Secured Acquiring Creditors may only require a Senior
Liabilities Transfer if, at the same time, they require a transfer of the Hedging Liabilities in accordance with
the Intercreditor Agreement and if, for any reason, such transfer cannot be made in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement, no Senior Liabilities Transfer may be required to be made.

At the request of a Senior Agent (on behalf of the Senior Secured Acquiring Creditors), the Senior Facility

connection with such transfer.

(i) the date falling 120 days after delivery of that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice;

(ii) in relation to payments of Second Lien Liabilities, if a Second Lien Standstill Period is in effect at
any time after delivery of that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice, the date on which that Second
Lien Standstill Period expires;

(iii) the date on which the relevant Material Event of Default has been remedied or waived in accordance
with the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Notes Indenture or any Permitted Senior Financing
Agreement (as applicable);

(iv) the date on which the Senior Agent which delivered the relevant Second Lien Payment Stop Notice
delivers a notice to the Parent, the Security Agent and the Second Lien Agents cancelling the Second
Lien Payment Stop Notice;

(v) the Senior Discharge Date; and

(vi) the date on which the Security Agent or a Second Lien Agent takes Enforcement Action permitted
under the Intercreditor Agreement against a Debtor.

Unless each of the Second Lien Agents waives this requirement, (i) a new Second Lien Payment Stop Notice
may not be delivered unless and until 360 days have elapsed since the delivery of the immediately prior Second
Lien Payment Stop Notice; and (ii) no Second Lien Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by a Senior Agent
in reliance on a Material Event of Default more than 75 days after the date that Senior Agent received notice
of that Material Event of Default.

The Senior Agents may only serve one Second Lien Payment Stop Notice with respect to the same event or set
of circumstances. Subject to the immediately preceding paragraph, this shall not affect the right of the Agents
to issue a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice in respect of any other event or set of circumstances. No Second
Lien Payment Stop Notice may be served by an Agent in respect of a Material Event of Default which had
been notified to the Agents at the time at which an earlier Second Lien Payment Stop Notice was issued.

Any failure to make a payment due under the Second Lien Debt Documents as a result of the issue of a
Second Lien Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Payment Default shall not prevent (i) the
occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined under a Second Lien Financing Agreement) as a consequence
of that failure to make a payment in relation to the relevant Second Lien Debt Document; or (ii) the issue of
a Second Lien Enforcement Notice (as defined below) on behalf of the Second Lien Secured Creditors.

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

No Debtor shall be released from the liability to make any payment (including of default interest, which shall
continue to accrue) under any Second Lien Debt Document by the operation of the provisions set out under
each section above under the caption “—Restrictions Relating to Second Lien Secured Creditors and Second
_Lien Liabilities” even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time by the terms of any of_
those provisions.

The accrual and capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with the Second Lien Debt Documents shall
continue notwithstanding the issue of a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice.

_Cure of Payment Stop—Second Lien Secured Creditors_

If:

(i) at any time following the issue of a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior
Payment Default, that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice ceases to be outstanding and/or, as the case
may be, the Senior Payment Default ceases to be continuing; and

(ii) any Debtor then promptly pays to the Second Lien Secured Creditors an amount equal to any Payments
which had accrued under the Second Lien Debt Documents and which would have been Permitted
Second Lien Payments but for that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice or Senior Payment Default,


-----

then any Event of Default (including any cross default or similar provision under any other Debt Document)
which may have occurred as a result of that suspension of Payments shall be waived and any Second Lien
Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result of that Event of Default shall be waived, in each
case without any further action being required on the part of the Second Lien Secured Creditors or any other
Creditor or Operating Facility Lender.

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Second Lien Secured Creditors_

Until the Senior Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of or as required by an Instructing Group:

(i) no Second Lien Secured Creditor shall direct the Security Agent to enforce or otherwise require the
enforcement of any security; and/or

(ii) no Second Lien Secured Creditor shall take or require the taking of any Enforcement Action in relation
to the Second Lien Liabilities,

except as permitted under the provisions set out below under the caption “—Permitted Second Lien
_Enforcement” below, provided, however, that no such action required by the Security Agent need be taken_
except to the extent the Security Agent otherwise is entitled under the Intercreditor Agreement to direct such
action.

**_Permitted Second Lien Enforcement_**

Subject to the provisions set out under the caption “—Enforcement on behalf of Second Lien Secured
_Creditors,” the restrictions set out under the caption “—Payment Blockage Provisions—Restrictions on_
_Enforcement by Second Lien Secured Creditors” above will not apply if:_

(i) an Event of Default (as defined under a Second Lien Financing Agreement, a “Second Lien Event of
Default”) (the “Relevant Second Lien Default”) is continuing;

(ii) each Senior Agent has received a notice of the Relevant Second Lien Default specifying the event or
circumstance in relation to the Relevant Second Lien Default from the relevant Second Lien Agent;

(iii) a Second Lien Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and

(iv) the Relevant Second Lien Default is continuing at the end of the relevant Second Lien Standstill Period.

Promptly upon becoming aware of a Second Lien Event of Default, the relevant Second Lien Agent may by
notice (a “Second Lien Enforcement Notice”) in writing notify the Senior Agents of the existence of such
Second Lien Event of Default.

_Second Lien Standstill Period_

In relation to a Relevant Second Lien Default, a Second Lien Standstill Period shall mean the period beginning
on the date (the “Second Lien Standstill Start Date”) the relevant Senior Agent serves a Second Lien
Enforcement Notice on each of the Senior Agents in respect of such Second Lien Event of Default and
ending on the earlier to occur of:

(i) the date falling 120 days after the Second Lien Standstill Start Date;

(ii) the date the Senior Secured Parties (other than the Second Lien Secured Creditors) take any Enforcement
Action in relation to a particular Second Lien Borrower or Second Lien Guarantor, provided, however,
that if a Senior Parent Standstill Period (as defined herein) ends pursuant to this paragraph, the Second
Lien Secured Creditors may only take the same Enforcement Action in relation to the relevant Second
Lien Borrower or Second Lien Guarantor as the Enforcement Action taken by the Senior Secured Parties
(other than the Second Lien Secured Creditors) against such Second Lien Borrower or Second Lien
Guarantor and not against any other member of the Group;

(iii) the date of an Insolvency Event in relation to the relevant Second Lien Borrower or a particular Second
Lien Guarantor against whom Enforcement Action is to be taken;

(iv) the expiry of any other Second Lien Standstill Period outstanding at the date such first mentioned Second
Lien Standstill Period commenced (unless that expiry occurs as a result of a cure, waiver or other
permitted remedy);

(v) (v) the date on which the consent of each of the Senior Facility Agent (acting on the instructions of the


-----

Majority Senior Lenders), any Senior Notes Trustee (acting on behalf of the Senior Noteholders) and
any Senior Creditor Representative (acting on the instructions the Majority Permitted Senior Financing
Creditors) has been obtained; and

(vi) a failure to pay the principal amount outstanding under any Second Lien Facility or on any Permitted
Second Lien Financing Debt, as the case may be, at the final stated maturity of the amounts outstanding
on that Second Lien Facility or on that Permitted Second Lien Financing Debt, as the case may be
(provided that, unless the Senior Lender Discharge Date has occurred or as otherwise agreed by the
Majority Senior Lenders and the Parent, such final stated maturity does not fall on a date prior to the
date falling 85 months after July 27, 2017).

_Subsequent Second Lien Facility Defaults_

The Second Lien Secured Creditors may take Enforcement Action under the provisions set out in caption
_“—Permitted Second Lien Enforcement” in relation to a Relevant Second Lien Default even if, at the end of_
any relevant Second Lien Standstill Period or at any later time, a further Second Lien Standstill Period has
begun as a result of any other Second Lien Event of Default.

_Enforcement on Behalf of Second Lien Secured Creditors_

If the Security Agent has notified the Second Lien Agents that it is enforcing Security created pursuant to any
Security Document over shares of a Second Lien Borrower or a Second Lien Guarantor, no Second Lien
Secured Creditor may take any action referred to under the provisions set out under the caption “—Permitted
_Second Lien Enforcement” against that Second Lien Borrower or Second Lien Guarantor (or any Subsidiary_
of that Second Lien Borrower or Second Lien Guarantor) while the Security Agent is taking steps to enforce
that Security in accordance with the instructions of an Instructing Group where such action might be
reasonably likely to adversely affect such enforcement or the amount of proceeds to be derived therefrom.

_Option to Purchase: Second Lien Secured Creditors_

Subject to the following paragraphs, any of the Second Lien Agent(s) (on behalf of the Second Lien Secured
Creditors) may, after an acceleration event under any of the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Notes
Indenture or in relation to any Permitted Senior Financing Debt which is continuing, by giving not less than
ten days’ notice to the Security Agent, require the transfer to the Second Lien Secured Creditors (or to a
nominee or nominees) of all, but not part, of the rights, benefits and obligations in respect of the Senior
Lender Liabilities, the Senior Notes Liabilities, any Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities and the Operating
Facility Liabilities if:

(i) that transfer is lawful and, subject to paragraph (ii) below, otherwise permitted by the terms of the Senior
Facilities Agreement (in the case of the Senior Lender Liabilities), any Senior Notes Indenture(s)
pursuant to which any Senior Notes remain outstanding (in the case of the Senior Notes Liabilities), any
Permitted Senior Financing Agreement pursuant to which any relevant Permitted Senior Financing
Liabilities remain outstanding (in the case of the Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities) and/or any
Operating Facility Documents pursuant to which any relevant Operating Facility Liabilities remain
outstanding (in the case of the Operating Facility Liabilities);

(ii) any conditions relating to such a transfer contained in the Senior Facilities Agreement (in the case of the
Senior Lender Liabilities), any Senior Notes Indenture(s) pursuant to which any Senior Notes remain
outstanding (in the case of the Senior Notes Liabilities), any Permitted Senior Financing Agreement
pursuant to which any relevant Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities remain outstanding (in the case of
the Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities) and/or any Operating Facility Documents pursuant to which
any relevant Operating Facility Liabilities remain outstanding (in the case of the Operating Facility
Liabilities) are complied with, in each case, other than as specified in the Intercreditor Agreement;

(iii) each of the Senior Facility Agent (on behalf of the Senior Lenders), the applicable Senior Notes Trustee
(on behalf of the relevant Senior Noteholders), the applicable Senior Creditor Representative (on behalf
of the relevant Permitted Senior Financing Creditors) and the Operating Facility Lenders is paid the
amounts required under the Intercreditor Agreement;

(iv) as a result of that transfer the Senior Lenders, the Senior Notes Creditors, the Permitted Senior Financing
Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders have no further actual or contingent liability to the Parent
or any other Debtor under the relevant Secured Debt Documents;


-----

(v) an indemnity is provided from each Second Lien Secured Creditor (other than any Second Lien Agent)
(or from another third-party acceptable to all the Senior Lenders, the Senior Notes Creditors, the
Permitted Senior Financing Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders) in a form reasonably
satisfactory to each Senior Lender, Senior Notes Creditor, Permitted Senior Financing Creditor and
Operating Facility Lender in respect of all costs, expenses, losses and liabilities which may be sustained or
incurred by any Senior Lender, Senior Notes Creditor, Permitted Senior Financing Creditor or Operating
Facility Lender in consequence of any sum received or recovered by any Senior Lender, Senior Notes
Creditor, Permitted Senior Financing Creditor or Operating Facility Lender from any person being
required (or it being alleged that it is required) to be paid back by or clawed back from any Senior Lender,
Senior Notes Creditor, Permitted Senior Financing Creditor or Operating Facility Lender for any reason;
and

(vi) the transfer is made without recourse to, or representation or warranty from, the Senior Lenders, the
Senior Notes Creditors, the Permitted Senior Financing Creditors or the Operating Facility Lenders,
except that each Senior Lender, Senior Notes Creditor, Permitted Senior Financing Creditor and
Operating Facility Lender shall be deemed to have represented and warranted on the date of that transfer
that it has the corporate power to effect that transfer and it has taken all necessary action to authorize the
making by it of that transfer.

Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, a Second Lien Agent (on behalf of all the Second Lien
Secured Creditors) may only require a transfer of Senior Secured Liabilities if, at the same time, they require
a transfer of hedging liabilities regulated by the Intercreditor Agreement and if, for any reason, such transfer
cannot be made in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, no transfer of Senior Secured Liabilities
may be required to be made.

At the request of a Second Lien Agent (on behalf of all the Second Lien Secured Creditors), the Senior
Facility Agent, any relevant Senior Notes Trustee, any relevant Senior Creditor Representative and the
Operating Facility Lenders shall notify the Second Lien Agents of the foregoing payable sums in connection
with such transfer.

member of the Group) for, or in respect of, any Senior Parent Notes liabilities or any Permitted Parent

**_Payment Blockage Provisions—Restrictions on Enforcement by Senior Parent Creditors_**

Until the Senior Discharge Date, except with the Required Senior Consent, and until the Second Lien
Discharge Date, except with the Required Second Lien Consent, no Senior Parent Debt Issuer shall make
(and the Parent shall procure that no other member of the Group shall make), and neither the Senior Parent
Notes Trustee, any holder of Senior Parent Notes or the Permitted Parent Financing Creditors may receive
from any other members of the Group, any Permitted Senior Parent Payment (other than, for the avoidance
of doubt, a roll up or capitalization of any amount and certain amounts due to the Senior Parent Notes
Trustee for its own account, payments funded by amounts not received from another member of the Group or
payments funded by Permitted Parent Financing Debt and/or the proceeds of any indebtedness incurred or
pursuant to any Senior Parent Notes) if:

(a) a Senior Payment Default is continuing; or

(b) an event of default under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Notes Indenture and/or any
Permitted Senior Financing Agreement (a “Senior Event of Default”) (other than a Senior Payment
Default) is continuing, from the date which is one business day after the date on which any of the Senior
Facility Agent, the Senior Notes Trustee and any Senior Creditor Representative (together, the “Senior
Agents”) delivers a payment stop notice (a “Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice”) specifying the event or
circumstance in relation to that Senior Event of Default to the Parent, the Security Agent, the Senior
Parent Notes Trustee and any Senior Parent Creditor Representative until the earliest of:

(i) the date falling 179 days after delivery of that Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice;

(ii) in relation to payments of the Senior Parent Notes liabilities and any Permitted Parent Financing

with the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Notes Indenture or any Permitted Senior Financing
Agreement (as applicable);

(iv) the date on which the Senior Agent which delivered the relevant Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice

(vi) the date on which the Security Agent, the Senior Parent Notes Trustee and any Senior Parent

the delivery of the immediately prior Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice; and (ii) no Senior Parent Payment
Stop Notice may be delivered by a Senior Agent in reliance on a Senior Event of Default more than 45 days
after the date that Senior Agent received notice of that Senior Event of Default.

The Senior Agents may only serve one Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice with respect to the same event or
set of circumstances. Subject to the immediately preceding paragraph, this shall not affect the right of the
Senior Agents to issue a Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice in respect of any other event or set of
circumstances. No Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice may be served by a Senior Agent in respect of a Senior
Event of Default which had been notified to the Senior Agents at the time at which an earlier Senior Parent
Payment Stop Notice was issued.

Any failure to make a payment due under any Senior Parent Notes Indenture and any Permitted Parent
Financing Documents as a result of the issue of a Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a
Senior Payment Default shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in any Senior
Parent Notes Indenture or any Permitted Parent Financing Documents, as applicable) as a consequence of
that failure to make a payment in relation to the relevant Senior Parent Notes Indenture and any Permitted
Parent Financing Documents; or (ii) the issue of a Senior Parent Enforcement Notice (as defined below) on
behalf of the Senior Parent Creditors.

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

Neither the relevant Senior Parent Debt Issuer nor any other Debtor shall be released from the liability to
make any payment (including of default interest, which shall continue to accrue) under any Senior Parent
Notes Indenture and any Permitted Parent Financing Document by the operation of the provisions set out
under each section above under the caption “—Restrictions Relating to Senior Parent Creditors and Senior
_Parent Liabilities” even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time by the terms of any of_
those provisions.

The accrual and capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with any Senior Parent Notes Indenture and
any Permitted Parent Financing Document shall continue notwithstanding the issue of a Senior Parent
Payment Stop Notice.

_Cure of Payment Stop—Senior Parent Creditors_

If:

(i) at any time following the issue of a Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior
Payment Default, that Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice ceases to be outstanding and/or, as the case
may be, the Senior Payment Default ceases to be continuing; and

(ii) the relevant Senior Parent Debt Issuer or the relevant Debtor then promptly pays to the Senior Parent
Creditors an amount equal to any payments which had accrued under any Senior Parent Notes Indenture
and any Permitted Parent Financing Document and which would have been Permitted Senior Parent
Payments but for that Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice or Senior Payment Default,

then any Event of Default (including any cross default or similar provision under any other debt document)
which may have occurred as a result of that suspension of payments shall be waived and any Senior Parent
Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result of that Event of Default shall be waived, in each
case without any further action being required on the part of the Senior Parent Creditors or any other Creditor
or Operating Facility Lender.

_Restrictions on Amendments and Waivers_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Senior Parent Creditors, the relevant Senior Parent Debt
Issuers and other Debtors may amend or waive the terms of the Senior Parent Notes finance documents
and/or the Permitted Parent Financing Documents in accordance with their respective terms from time to
time (and subject only to any consent required under them).

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Senior Parent Creditors_

Until the First/Second Lien Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of or as required by an Instructing
Group:

(ii) no Senior Parent Creditor shall take or require the taking of any Enforcement Action in relation to the
guarantees by a member of the Group of any of the obligations of any member of the Group under the
Senior Parent Notes finance documents and/or Permitted Parent Financing Documents,

except as permitted under the provisions set out below under the caption “—Permitted Senior Parent
_Enforcement” below, provided, however, that no such action required by the Security Agent need be taken_
except to the extent the Security Agent otherwise is entitled under the Intercreditor Agreement to direct such
action.

**_Permitted Senior Parent Enforcement_**

The restrictions set out under the caption “—Payment Blockage Provisions—Restrictions on Enforcement by
_Senior Parent Creditors” above will not apply if:_

Parent Default”) is continuing;

(ii) each Senior Agent has received a notice of the Relevant Senior Parent Default specifying the event or
circumstance in relation to the Relevant Senior Parent Default from the Senior Parent Notes Trustee or
any Senior Parent Creditor Representative (as the case may be);

(iii) a Senior Parent Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and

(iv) the Relevant Senior Parent Default is continuing at the end of the relevant Senior Parent Standstill

Senior Parent Creditor Representative, as the case may be, may by notice (a “Senior Parent Enforcement
Notice”) in writing notify the Senior Agents of the existence of such Senior Parent Event of Default.

_Senior Parent Standstill Period_

In relation to a Relevant Senior Parent Default, a Senior Parent Standstill Period shall mean the period

Period”);

(ii) the date the Senior Secured Parties take any Enforcement Action in relation to a particular guarantor of
the Senior Parent Notes and/or any Permitted Parent Financing Debt (a “Senior Parent Guarantor”),
provided, however, that if a Senior Parent Standstill Period ends pursuant to this paragraph, the Senior
Parent Creditors may only take the same Enforcement Action in relation to the Senior Parent Guarantor
as the Enforcement Action taken by the Senior Secured Parties against such Senior Parent Guarantor
and not against any other member of the Group;

(iii) the date of an Insolvency Event in relation to the relevant Senior Parent Debt Issuer or a particular
Senior Parent Guarantor against whom Enforcement Action is to be taken;

(iv) the expiry of any other Senior Parent Standstill Period outstanding at the date such first mentioned
Senior Parent Standstill Period commenced (unless that expiry occurs as a result of a cure, waiver or
other permitted remedy);

(v) the date on which the consent of each of the Senior Facility Agent (acting on the instructions of the
Majority Senior Lenders), the Second Lien Facility Agent (acting on the instructions of the Majority
Second Lien Lenders), any Senior Notes Trustee (acting on behalf of the Senior Noteholders), any Senior
Creditor Representative (acting on the instructions the Majority Permitted Senior Financing Creditors)
and any Second Lien Creditor Representative (acting on the instructions of the Majority Permitted
Second Lien Financing Creditors) has been obtained; and


-----

(vi) a failure to pay the principal amount outstanding on any Senior Parent Notes or on any Permitted
Parent Financing Debt, as the case may be, at the final stated maturity of the amounts outstanding on
the Senior Parent Notes or on the Permitted Parent Financing Debt, as the case may be (provided that
(i) unless the Senior Lender Discharge Date has occurred or as otherwise agreed by the Majority Senior
Lenders and the Parent, such final stated maturity does not fall on a date prior to the date falling
85 months after July 27, 2017; and (ii) if any Second Lien Debt has been incurred, unless the Second Lien
Lender Discharge Date has occurred or as otherwise agreed by the Majority Second Lien Lenders and
the Parent, such final stated maturity does not fall on a date prior to the date falling 85 months after
July 27, 2017).

_Subsequent Senior Parent Event of Default_

The Senior Parent Finance Parties may take Enforcement Action under the provisions set out in caption
“—Permitted Senior Parent Enforcement” above in relation to a Relevant Senior Parent Default even if, at the
end of any relevant Senior Parent Standstill Period or at any later time, a further Senior Parent Standstill
Period has begun as a result of any other Senior Parent Event of Default.

_Enforcement on Behalf of Senior Parent Creditors_

If the Security Agent has notified the Senior Parent Agents that it is enforcing security created pursuant to
any security document over shares of a Senior Parent Guarantor, no Senior Parent Creditor may take any
action referred to under the provisions set out under the caption “—Permitted Senior Parent Enforcement”
above against that Senior Parent Guarantor (or any subsidiary of that Senior Parent Guarantor) while the
Security Agent is taking steps to enforce that security in accordance with the instructions of an Instructing
Group where such action might be reasonably likely to adversely affect such enforcement or the amount of
proceeds to be derived therefrom.

_Option to Purchase: Senior Parent Creditors_

Subject to paragraphs (ii) and (iii) below any of the Senior Parent Notes Trustee and any Senior Parent
Creditor Representative (on behalf of the Senior Parent Creditors) may, after an acceleration event under any
of the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Notes or in relation to any Permitted Senior Financing Debt
which is continuing, by giving not less than ten days’ notice to the Security Agent, require the transfer to the
Senior Parent Creditors (or to a nominee or nominees) of all, but not part, of the rights, benefits and
obligations in respect of the Senior Secured Liabilities and the Operating Facility Liabilities if:

Senior Lender Liabilities), the Second Lien Facility Agreement (in the case of the Second Lien Lenders
Liabilities), any Senior Notes Indenture(s) pursuant to which any Senior Notes remain outstanding (in
the case of the Senior Notes liabilities), any Permitted Senior Financing Agreement pursuant to which

Liabilities) are complied with, in each case, other than as specified in the Intercreditor Agreement;

(iii) each of the Senior Facility Agent (on behalf of the Senior Lenders), the Senior Notes Trustee (on behalf
of the relevant Senior Noteholders), the applicable Senior Creditor Representative (on behalf of the
relevant Permitted Senior Financing Creditors), the Operating Facility Lenders, the Second Lien Facility

(vi) the transfer is made without recourse to, or representation or warranty from, the Senior Lenders, the

**_Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, among other things, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event
in relation to any Debtor, or, following an acceleration event which is continuing, any member of the Group,
any party entitled to receive a distribution out of the assets of that member of the Group in respect of liabilities
owed to that party shall (in the case of any Creditor or Operating Facility Lender, only to the extent that such
distribution would otherwise constitute a receipt or recovery of a type subject to the provisions set out below
under the caption “—Turnover” and, in all cases, if prior to a distress event, only if required by the Security
Agent acting on the instructions of an Instructing Group), subject to receiving payment instructions and any
other relevant information from the Security Agent and to the extent it is able to do so, direct the person
responsible for the distribution of the assets of that member of the Group to pay that distribution to the
Security Agent until the liabilities owing to the Secured Parties have been paid in full. In this respect, the
Security Agent shall apply distributions paid to it in accordance with the provisions set out under the caption
“—Application of Proceeds” below.

Subject to certain exceptions, to the extent that any member of the Group’s liabilities are discharged by way of
set-off (mandatory or otherwise) after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to that member of
the Group, any Creditor and any Operating Facility Lender which benefited from that set-off shall (in the case
of any Creditor or Operating Facility Lender, only to the extent that such distribution would otherwise


-----

constitute a receipt or recovery of a type subject to the provisions set out below under the caption
“—Turnover” and, in all cases, if prior to a distress event, only if required by the Security Agent acting on the
instructions of an Instructing Group), subject to receiving payment instructions and any other relevant
information from the Security Agent, pay an amount equal to the amount of the liabilities owed to it which
are discharged by that set-off to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out
under the caption “—Application of Proceeds” below and subject to certain exceptions.

Subject to the provisions set out under the caption “—Application of Proceeds” below, if the Security Agent
or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in respect of any of the liabilities,
the liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the extent that the realization proceeds
are actually applied towards the liabilities.

After the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to any Debtor (or, following an acceleration event
which is continuing, any member of the Group), each Creditor and each Operating Facility Lender irrevocably
authorizes the Security Agent, on its behalf, to:

(i) take any Enforcement Action (in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) against that
member of the Group;

(ii) demand, sue, prove and give receipt for any or all of that member of the Group’s liabilities;

(iii) collect and receive all distributions on, or on account of, any or all of that member of the Group’s
liabilities; and

(iv) file claims, take proceedings and do all other things the Security Agent considers reasonably necessary to
recover that member of the Group’s liabilities.

Each Creditor and Operating Facility Lender will (i) do all things that the Security Agent (acting in accordance
with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) reasonably requests in order to give effect to the matters
referred to in this “—Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims” section and (ii) if the Security Agent is not
entitled to take any of the actions contemplated by this “—Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims”
section or if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) requests
that a Creditor or Operating Facility Lender take that action, undertake that action itself in accordance with
the instructions of the Security Agent or grant a power of attorney to the Security Agent (on such terms as
the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) may reasonably
require, although neither the Senior Notes Trustee nor the Senior Parent Notes Trustee shall be under any
obligation to grant such powers of attorney) to enable the Security Agent to take such action.

**_Turnover_**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that if any Creditor or Operating Facility
Lender receives or recovers from any member of the Group:

(i) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities which is prohibited
under the Intercreditor Agreement or, following the occurrence of a Senior Distress Event which is
continuing, any Senior Lender Liabilities, Hedging Liabilities, Senior Notes liabilities, Permitted Senior
Financing liabilities or Operating Facility Liabilities;

(ii) other than as referred to in the second paragraph of the caption “—Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of
_Claims” any amount by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it which does not give_
effect to a payment permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement;

(iii) notwithstanding paragraphs (i) and (ii) above, other than as referred to in the second paragraph of the
caption “—Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims” any amount:

(A) on account of, or in relation to, any of the liabilities after the occurrence of a distress event (including
as a result of any litigation or proceedings against a member of the Group other than after the
occurrence of an Insolvency Event in respect of that member of the Group); or

(B) by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it after the occurrence of a distress event,

other than, in each case, any amount received or recovered in accordance with the provisions set out below the
caption “—Application of Proceeds”;

(iv) the proceeds of any enforcement of any security except in accordance with the provisions set out below
under the caption “—Application of Proceeds”; or


-----

(v) subject to certain exceptions, any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on account of or in
relation to, any of the liabilities owed by any member of Group which is not in accordance with the
provisions set out under the caption “—Application of Proceeds” and which is made as a result of, or
after, the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in respect of that member of Group,

that Creditor or Operating Facility Lender will, subject to certain exceptions: (i) in relation to receipts and
recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off (x) hold an amount of that receipt or recovery equal to
the relevant liabilities (or if less, the amount received or recovered) on trust for the Security Agent and subject
to receiving payment instructions and any other relevant information from the Security Agent, promptly pay
that amount to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement
and (y) subject to receiving payment instructions and any other relevant information the Security Agent,
promptly pay an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which the receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant
liabilities to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement;
and (ii) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, subject to receiving
payment instructions and any other relevant information from the Security Agent, promptly pay an amount
equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement.

**_Enforcement of Security_**

_Enforcement Instructions_

The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the security unless instructed otherwise by (i) an Instructing
Group; (ii) if required as set out in the third paragraph of this section, the Majority Second Lien Creditors or
(iii) if required as set out under the fourth paragraph of this section, the Majority Senior Parent Creditors.

Subject to the security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms (i) an Instructing Group; (ii) to
the extent permitted to enforce or to require the enforcement of the security prior to the Senior Discharge
Date as described under the caption “—Restrictions Relating to Second Lien Secured Creditors and Second
_Lien Liabilities” above, the Majority Second Lien Creditors or (iii) to the extent permitted to enforce or to_
require the enforcement of the security prior to the First/Second Lien Discharge Date as described under the
provisions under the caption “—Restrictions Relating to Senior Parent Creditors and Senior Parent Liabilities”
above, the Majority Senior Parent Creditors, may give or refrain from giving, instructions to the Security
Agent to enforce, or refrain from enforcing, the security as they see fit.

Prior to the Senior Discharge Date, (i) if an Instructing Group has instructed the Security Agent not to
enforce or to cease enforcing the security or (ii) in the absence of instructions from an Instructing Group, and,
in each case, an Instructing Group has not required any Debtor to make a distressed disposal, the Security
Agent shall give effect to any instructions to enforce the security which the Majority Second Lien Creditors
are then entitled to give to the Security Agent as described under the provisions under the caption
“—Permitted Second Lien Enforcement” above.

Prior to the First/Second Lien Discharge Date, (i) if an Instructing Group has instructed the Security Agent
not to enforce or to cease enforcing the security or (ii) in the absence of instructions from an Instructing
Group, and, in each case, an Instructing Group has not required any Debtor to make a distressed disposal, the
Security Agent shall give effect to any instructions to enforce the security which the Majority Senior Parent
Creditors are then entitled to give to the Security Agent as described under the provisions under the caption
“—Permitted Senior Parent Enforcement” above.

Subject to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, no secured party shall have any independent
power to enforce, or to have recourse to enforce, any security or to exercise any rights or powers arising under
the security documents except through the Security Agent in the manner contemplated by the Intercreditor
Agreement.

_Manner of Enforcement_

If the security is being enforced as set forth above under the caption “—Enforcement of Security—Enforcement
_Instructions,” the Security Agent shall enforce the security in such manner (including, without limitation, the_
selection of any administrator, examiner or equivalent officer of any Debtor to be appointed by the Security
Agent) as:

(a) an Instructing Group;


-----

(b) prior to the Senior Discharge Date, if (i) the Security Agent has, pursuant to the third paragraph under
the caption “—Enforcement of Security”above, given effect to instructions given by the Majority Second
Lien Creditors to enforce the security; and (ii) an Instructing Group has not given instructions as to the
manner of enforcement of the security, the Majority Second Lien Creditors; or

(c) prior to the First/Second Lien Discharge Date, if (i) the Security Agent has, pursuant to the fourth
paragraph under the caption “—Enforcement of Security”above, given effect to instructions given by the
Majority Senior Parent Creditors to enforce the security; and (ii) an Instructing Group has not given
instructions as to the manner of enforcement of the security, the Majority Senior Parent Creditors,

shall instruct or, in the absence of any such instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit (it being understood
that, absent such instructions, the Security Agent may elect to take no action).

_Exercise of Voting Rights_

To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, each Creditor (other than the Senior Notes Trustee and
the Senior Parent Notes Trustee) and each Operating Facility Lender shall agree with the Security Agent that
it will cast its vote in any proposal put to the vote by, or under the supervision of, any judicial or supervisory
authority in respect of any insolvency, pre-insolvency or rehabilitation or similar proceedings relating to any
member of the Group as instructed by the Security Agent. The Security Agent shall give instructions for the
purposes of this paragraph as directed by an Instructing Group. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party can
exercise or require any other Creditor or Operating Facility Lender under the Intercreditor Agreement to
exercise its power of voting or representation to waive, reduce, discharge, extend the due date for payment or
otherwise reschedule any of the liabilities owed to that Creditor or Operating Facility Lender.

_Waiver of Rights_

To the extent permitted under applicable law and subject to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement,
each of the Secured Parties and the Debtors waives all rights it may otherwise have to require that the security
be enforced in any particular order or manner or at any particular time, or that any sum received or recovered
from any person, or by virtue of the enforcement of any of the security or of any other security interest, which
is capable of being applied in or towards discharge of any of the secured obligations, is so applied.

_Security Held by Other Creditors_

If any security is held by a Creditor or Operating Facility Lender other than the Security Agent, then that
Creditor or Operating Facility Lender may only enforce that security in accordance with instructions given by
an Instructing Group pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (and for this purpose references
to the Security Agent shall be construed as references to that Creditor or Operating Facility Lender).

**_Consultation Period_**

(a) Subject to paragraph (d) below, before giving any instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the security
or refrain or cease from enforcing the security or to take any other Enforcement Action, the creditor
representative(s) of the creditors of the Group represented in the Instructing Group concerned (and, if
applicable, any relevant Hedge Counterparties) shall consult with each other creditor representative,
each other Hedge Counterparty, each Operating Facility Lender and the Security Agent in good faith
about the instructions to be given by the Instructing Group for a period of not less than 30 days from the
date on which details of the proposed instructions are received by such creditor representative(s), Hedge
Counterparties, Operating Facility Lenders and the Security Agent (or such shorter period as each
creditor representative, Hedge Counterparty, Operating Facility Lender and the Security Agent shall
agree) (the “Consultation Period”), and only following the expiry of a Consultation Period shall the
Instructing Group be entitled to give any instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the security or
refrain or cease from enforcing the security or take any other Enforcement Action.

(b) Subject to paragraph (c) below, in the event conflicting instructions are received from any other
Instructing Group, the Security Agent shall enforce the security, refrain or cease from enforcing the
security or, as the case may be, take the relevant other Enforcement Action in accordance with the
instructions given by an Instructing Group referred to in paragraph (a)(i)(A) of the definition of
Instructing Group as set out above (in each case provided that such instructions are consistent with any
applicable requirements of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents) and the terms of
all instructions given by any other Instructing Group shall be deemed revoked.


-----

(c) Prior to the Senior Lender Discharge Date, if:

(i) the Senior Creditors have not been fully repaid within six months of the end of the first Consultation
Period;

(ii) the Security Agent has not commenced any enforcement of the security (or a transaction in lieu
thereof) or other Enforcement Action within three-months of the end of the first Consultation
Period; or

(iii) an Insolvency Event has occurred and the Security Agent has not commenced any enforcement of
the security (or a transaction in lieu thereof) or other Enforcement Action at that time,

then the Security Agent shall follow the instructions given by the Majority Senior Creditors (in each case
provided that such instructions are consistent with any applicable requirements of the Intercreditor
Agreement and the relevant security documents).

(d) Subject to paragraph (c) above, no Agent or Hedge Counterparty shall be obliged to consult in
accordance with paragraph (a) above and an Instructing Group shall be entitled to give any instructions
to the Security Agent to enforce the security or take any other Enforcement Action prior to the end of a
Consultation Period (in each case provided that such instructions are consistent with any applicable
requirements of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents) if:

(i) the security has become enforceable as a result of an Insolvency Event; or

(ii) the Instructing Group or any creditor representative of the Creditors represented in the Instructing
Group determines in good faith (and notifies each other creditor representative, the Hedge
Counterparties and the Security Agent) that to enter into such consultations and thereby delay the
commencement of enforcement of the security would reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on:

(A) the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any of the security; or

(B) the realization proceeds of any enforcement of the security,

and, where this paragraph (d) applies:

(1) any instructions shall be limited to those necessary to protect or preserve the interests of
the Senior Secured Creditors on behalf of which the relevant Instructing Group is acting
in relation to the matters referred to in sub-paragraphs (A) and (B) above; and

(2) the Security Agent shall act in accordance with the instructions first received.

(e) As soon as reasonably practicable following receipt of any instructions from an Instructing Group to
enforce the security, refrain or cease from enforcing the security or, as the case may be, take any other
Enforcement Action, the Security Agent shall provide a copy of such instructions to each Agent, Hedge
Counterparty and Operating Facility Lender (unless it received those instructions from that person).

_Duties Owed_

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, each of the secured parties and the Debtors acknowledges that, in
the event that the Security Agent enforces, or is instructed to enforce, the security prior to the First/Second
Lien Discharge Date, the duties of the Security Agent and of any receiver or delegate owed to the Senior
Parent Creditors in respect of the method, type and timing of that enforcement or of the exploitation,
management or realization of any of that security shall, subject to the section entitled “Distressed Disposals”
below, be no different to or greater than the duty that is owed by the Security Agent, receiver or delegate to the
Debtors under general law.

**_Proceeds of Disposals_**

_Non-Distressed Disposals_

The Security Agent is irrevocably authorized and instructed (at the request and cost of the relevant Debtor or
the Parent) to promptly release (or procure that any other relevant person releases):

(i) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any asset which is the subject of:


-----

(A) a disposal not prohibited by the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement, any Senior Notes
Indenture, any Permitted Senior Financing Agreement, the Second Lien Facility Agreement, any
Permitted Second Lien Financing Agreement, any Senior Parent Notes Indenture and any Permitted
Parent Financing Agreement (each a “Debt Financing Agreement”) (including a disposal to a
member of the Group, but without prejudice to any obligation of any member of the Group in a
Debt Financing Agreement to provide replacement security); or

(B) any other transaction not prohibited by the terms of any Debt Financing Agreement pursuant to
which that asset will cease to be held or owned by a member of the Group;

(ii) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any document or other agreement
requested in order for any member of the Group to effect any amendment or waiver in respect of that
document or agreement or otherwise exercise any rights, comply with any obligations or take any action
in relation to that document or agreement (in each case to the extent not prohibited by the terms of any
Debt Financing Agreement);

(iii) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any asset of any member of the
Group which has ceased to be a Debtor (or will cease to be a Debtor simultaneously with such release);
and

(iv) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any other asset to the extent that
such release is in accordance with the terms of the Debt Financing Agreements.

In the case of a disposal of shares or other ownership interests in a Debtor (or any holding company of any
Debtor), or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor (or any holding company of any Debtor) will
cease to be a member of the Group or a Debtor (including in connection with the resignation of that Debtor
or the Debtor being designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary), the Security Agent (on behalf of itself and the
Secured Parties) shall (at the request and cost of the relevant Debtor or the Parent) promptly release (or
procure the release of) that Debtor and its subsidiaries (and its and their assets) from all present and future
liabilities under the Secured Debt Documents.

When making any request for a release pursuant to this “—Non-Distressed Disposals”section, the Parent shall
confirm in writing to the Security Agent that:

(i) in the case of any release requested pursuant to paragraph (i) or (ii) above, the relevant disposal or other
action is not prohibited by the terms of any Debt Financing Agreement; or

(ii) in the case of any release requested pursuant to paragraph (iv) above, the relevant release is in accordance
with terms of the Debt Financing Agreements,

and the Security Agent shall be entitled to rely on that confirmation for all purposes under the Secured Debt
Documents.

The Security Agent shall (at the cost and expense of the relevant Debtor or the Parent but without the need
for any further consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any Creditor, Operating Facility
Lender, other Secured Party or Debtor) promptly enter into and deliver such documentation and/or take such
other action as the Parent (acting reasonably) shall require to give effect to any release or other matter
described above.

Without prejudice to the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, if requested by the Parent in accordance
with the terms of any of the Debt Financing Agreements (and provided that the requested action is not
expressly prohibited by any of the other Debt Financing Agreements), the Security Agent and the other
Creditors and Operating Facility Lenders shall (at the cost of the relevant Debtor, the relevant Additional
Security Provider and/or the Parent) promptly execute any guarantee, security or other release and/or any
amendment, supplement or other documentation relating to the Security Documents as contemplated by the
terms of any of the Debt Financing Agreements (and the Security Agent is authorized to execute, and will
promptly execute if requested by the Parent, without the need for any further consent, sanction, authority or
further confirmation from any Creditor or Operating Facility Lender, any such release or document on behalf
of the Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders). When making any request pursuant to this paragraph
(d) the Parent shall confirm in writing to the Security Agent that such request is in accordance with the terms
of a Debt Financing Agreement (and the requested action is not expressly prohibited by way of any of the
other Debt Financing Agreements) and the Security Agent shall be entitled to rely on that confirmation for all
purposes under the Secured Debt Documents.


-----

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Debt Document, nothing in any Security Document shall
operate or be construed so as to prevent any transaction, matter or other step not prohibited by the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement or the Debt Financing Agreements (a “Permitted Transaction”). The Security
Agent (on behalf of itself and the Secured Parties) hereby agrees (and is irrevocably authorized and instructed
to do so without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any Party) that it shall (at the
request and cost of the relevant Debtor or the Parent) promptly execute any release or other document and/or
take such other action under or in relation to any Debt Document (or any asset subject or expressed to be
subject to any Security Document) as is requested by the Parent in order to complete, implement or facilitate
a Permitted Transaction.

If any member of the Group is required or permitted under the Senior Debt Documents to apply the proceeds
of any disposal or other transaction in prepayment, redemption or any other discharge or reduction of the
Senior Liabilities then no such application of those proceeds shall require the consent of any other party or
result in any breach of any Senior Parent Finance Documents and such application shall discharge in full any
obligation to apply those proceeds in prepayment, redemption or other discharge or reduction of any Senior
Parent Liabilities. This paragraph is without prejudice to any right of any member of the Group to apply any
proceeds of any disposal or other transaction in prepayment, redemption or any other discharge or reduction
of any Senior Parent Liabilities to the extent permitted or contemplated by the Intercreditor Agreement or
any other Senior Debt Document.

The Security Agent is irrevocably authorized by each Secured Party to (and will on the request and at the cost
of the Parent):

(i) release the security; and

(ii) release each investor, each Debtor and each other member of the Group from all liabilities, undertakings
and other obligations under the Secured Debt Documents,

on the Final Discharge Date (or at any time following such date on the request of the Parent).

_Distressed Disposals_

Generally, a “Distressed Disposal” is a disposal of an asset of a member of the Group which is (a) being
effected at the request of an Instructing Group in circumstances where a security interest has become
enforceable in accordance with the terms of the relevant security document(s), (b) being effected by
enforcement of a security interest in accordance with the terms of the relevant security document(s) or
(c) being disposed of to a third-party subsequent to a distress event.

If a Distressed Disposal of any asset of a member of the Group is being effected, the Security Agent is
irrevocably authorized (at the cost of the relevant Debtor, or the Parent and without any consent, sanction,
authority or further confirmation from any Creditor, Operating Facility Lender, other Secured Party or
Debtor):

(i) to release the security interest or any other claim over that asset and execute and deliver or enter into any
release of that security interest or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallization of any floating charge
or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be considered necessary or
desirable;

(ii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor to release:

(A) that Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing liabilities, its
guarantee liabilities and its other liabilities;

(B) any security granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of that Debtor over any of its assets; and

(C) any other claim of an investor, an intra-group lender, or another Debtor over that Debtor’s assets or
over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor,

on behalf of the relevant Creditors, Operating Facility Lenders, Debtors and certain creditor
representatives;

(iii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a Debtor, to
release:

(A) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or any part of its
borrowing liabilities, its guarantees liabilities and its other liabilities;


-----

(B) any security interest granted by that holding company or any subsidiary of that holding company
over any of its assets; and

(C) any other claim of any investor, any intra-group lender or another Debtor over that holding
company’s assets or the assets of any subsidiary of that holding company,

on behalf of the relevant Creditors, Operating Facility Lenders, Debtors and certain creditor
representatives;

(iv) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of
a Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to
dispose of all or any part of the liabilities or the Debtor liabilities owed by that Debtor or holding
company or any subsidiary of that Debtor or holding company:

(A) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does not intend that
any transferee of those liabilities or Debtor liabilities (the “Transferee”) will be treated as a Primary
Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement), to execute and deliver
or enter into any agreement to dispose of all or part of those liabilities or Debtor liabilities, provided
that, notwithstanding any other provision of any debt document, the Transferee shall not be treated
as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(B) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does intend that any
Transferee will be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the
Intercreditor Agreement), to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of: all (and
not part only) of the liabilities owed to the Primary Creditors and Operating Facility Lenders and
all or part of any other liabilities and the Debtor liabilities,

on behalf of, in each case, the relevant Creditors, Operating Facility Lenders and Debtors;

(v) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of
a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the “Receiving Entity”) all or any part of the Disposed
Entity’s obligations or any obligations of any subsidiary of that Disposed Entity in respect of the intragroup liabilities or the Debtor liabilities, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to:

(A) agree to the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or
Debtor liabilities on behalf of the relevant intra-group lenders and Debtors to which those
obligations are owed and on behalf of the Debtors which owe those obligations; and

(B) (if the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which is also a guarantor of
Senior Liabilities) to accept the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those intragroup liabilities or Debtor liabilities on behalf of the Receiving Entity or Receiving Entities to which
the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or Debtor liabilities are to be transferred.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities or Debtor
liabilities) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out under
the caption “—Application of Proceeds”(to the extent that the asset disposed of constituted charged property),
as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of the relevant security interest and, to the extent
that any disposal of liabilities or Debtor liabilities has occurred, as if that disposal of liabilities or Debtor
liabilities had not occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities) effected by, or at the request of, the Security
Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement), the Security Agent shall take reasonable care
to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing market conditions (though the Security Agent shall not have any
obligation to postpone any such Distressed Disposal or disposal of liabilities in order to achieve a higher
price).

Where Borrowing Liabilities, Guarantee Liabilities and/or Other Liabilities would otherwise be released
pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Creditor or Operating Facility Lender concerned may elect to
have those Borrowing Liabilities, Guarantee Liabilities and/or Other Liabilities transferred to the Parent in
which case the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (to the extent legally possible and at the cost of the
relevant Debtor or the Parent and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any
Creditor, Operating Facility Lender, other Secured Party or Debtor) to execute such documents as are required
to so transfer those Borrowing Liabilities, Guarantee Liabilities and/or Other Liabilities.


-----

Subject to the immediately following two paragraphs, in the case of a Distressed Disposal effected by or at the
request of the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement), unless the consent of
each Senior Agent is otherwise obtained, it is a further condition to any release, transfer or disposal that the
proceeds of such disposal are in cash (or substantially all in cash) and such sale or disposal is made pursuant
to a public auction in respect of which the Primary Creditors are entitled to participate or where a financial
adviser selected by the Security Agent has delivered an opinion in respect of such sale or disposal that the
amount received in connection therewith is fair from a financial point of view taking into account all relevant
circumstances, including the method of enforcement, provided that the liability of such financial adviser may
be limited to the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement (it being acknowledged that the Security
Agent shall have no obligation to select or engage any financial adviser unless it shall have been indemnified
and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

If prior to the Second Lien Discharge Date a Distressed Disposal is being effected such that any Second Lien

disposed of concurrently with such sale (and are not assumed by the purchaser or one of its affiliates)
and all security under the security documents in respect of the assets that are sold or disposed of is
simultaneously and unconditionally released and discharged concurrently with such sale, provided
that if each of the Senior Facility Agent, any Senior Notes Trustee and any Senior Creditor
Representative (acting reasonably and in good faith):

(A) determines that the Senior Secured Creditors will recover a greater amount if any such claim is
sold or otherwise transferred to the purchaser or one of its Affiliates and not released and
discharged; and

(B) serves a written notice on the Security Agent confirming the same, the Security Agent shall be
entitled to sell or otherwise transfer such claim to the purchaser or one of its affiliates; and

(iii) such sale or disposal is made:

(A) pursuant to a public auction in respect of which the Primary Creditors are entitled to

point of view, taking into account all relevant circumstances, including the method of
enforcement, provided that the liability of such financial adviser may be limited to the amount
of its fees in respect of such engagement (it being acknowledged that the Security Agent shall
have no obligation to select or engage any financial adviser unless it shall have been indemnified
and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

If prior to the first date on which the discharge date for the Senior Parent Notes and any Permitted Parent
Financing Debt has occurred, a Distressed Disposal is being effected such that, generally, the guarantees of
the Senior Parent Notes and the guarantees of any Permitted Parent Financing Debt or any security over the

proportions which their respective exposures at the relevant enforcement date bore to the aggregate exposures
of all the relevant Senior Secured Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders at the enforcement date (or, in
the case of Recoveries resulting from the realization or enforcement of all or any part of the security or a
transaction in lieu thereof, in a manner reflecting the order of priority contemplated in under the section
“—Application of Proceeds—Order of Application”), the relevant Senior Secured Creditors and the
Operating Facility Lenders will make such payments among themselves as the Security Agent shall require to
put the relevant Senior Secured Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders in such a position that (after
taking into account such payments) those losses are borne in those proportions (or, as the case may be, to
otherwise reflect the order of priority contemplated under the section “—Application of Proceeds—Order of
Application”).

**_Turnover of Enforcement Proceeds_**

If:

(a) Security Agent or the relevant Agent is not entitled, for reasons of applicable law, to pay amounts received
pursuant to the making of a demand under any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss or
the enforcement of the security to the Senior Secured Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders but is
entitled to distribute those amounts to Creditors (such Creditors, the “Receiving Creditors”) who, in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, are subordinated in right and priority of
payment to the Senior Secured Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders; and

(b) the First/Second Lien Discharge Date has not yet occurred (nor would occur after taking into account
such payments), then the Receiving Creditors shall make such payments to the Senior Secured Creditors
and the Operating Facility Lenders as the Security Agent shall require to place the Senior Secured
Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders in the position they would have been in had such amounts
been available for application against the Senior Liabilities and the Operating Facility Liabilities, provided
this shall not apply to any receipt or recovery that has been distributed by:

(i) a Senior Notes Trustee to the Senior Noteholders in accordance with the Senior Notes Finance
Documents;

(ii) a Senior Parent Notes Trustee to the Senior Parent Noteholders in accordance with the Senior
Parent;

(iii) a Senior Creditor Representative to the Permitted Senior Financing Creditors in accordance with

Second Lien Creditor Representative or the Senior Parent Creditor Representative (as applicable) had received
at least two Business Days’ prior written notice (in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) that an
acceleration event or an insolvency event in relation to a Debtor had occurred or that the receipt or recovery
falls within the provisions set out under the caption “—Turnover”prior to distribution of the relevant amount.

**_Group Pushdown_**

The Intercreditor Agreement, generally, provides that on, in contemplation of, or after, a public equity offering
(an “IPO Event”) of any member of the Group (other than (x) a subsidiary of a borrower or issuer which is
restricted from being designated as such by the relevant Debt Financing Agreement and is not replaced prior
to such a public equity offering with another Group entity or (y) a subsidiary of the Parent) or any of its
holding companies (the “IPO Entity”), at the Parent’s option:

(i) the Group shall comprise only the IPO Entity and its restricted subsidiaries from time to time (subject to
the exclusions set out in the definition of Group);

(ii) the IPO Entity shall take on the Parent’s role under the Intercreditor Agreement;

(iii) none of the representations, warranties, undertakings or other provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement
shall apply to any holding company of the IPO Entity (whether in its capacity as a Debtor or otherwise);

(iv) no event, matter or circumstance relating to any holding company of the IPO Entity (whether in its
capacity as a Debtor or otherwise) shall, or shall be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or result
in a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking or other term of the Intercreditor Agreement
or a default or an event of default;

(v) each holding company of the IPO Entity shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released from all
obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents (including any security
granted by any such holding company); and

(vi) unless otherwise notified by the Parent:

(A) each person which is party to the Intercreditor Agreement as an investor shall be irrevocably and
unconditionally released from the Intercreditor Agreement and all obligations and restrictions under
the Intercreditor Agreement (and from the date specified by the Parent that person shall cease to be
party to the Intercreditor Agreement as an investor and shall have no further rights or obligations
under the Intercreditor Agreement as an investor); and

(B) there shall be no obligation or requirement for any person to become party to the Intercreditor
Agreement as an investor, such amendments being a “Group Pushdown.”

In the event that any person is released from or does not become party to the Intercreditor Agreement as an
investor as a consequence of the above paragraph, any term of any debt document which requires or assumes
that any person be an investor or that any liabilities or obligations to such person be subject to the Intercreditor
Agreement or otherwise subordinated shall cease to apply.

The Parent must provide written notice to the Security Agent in order to implement a Group Pushdown. Such
a notice may be revoked prior to the IPO Event to which it relates provided that (where requested by an
Instructing Group) any security which was released is reinstated and any investor which was released from its
obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement accedes again.

The parties to the Intercreditor Agreement shall be required to enter into any amendment to or replacement
of it and/or take such other action as is required by the Parent to facilitate or reflect any of the matters
contemplated by the preceding paragraph and the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized to promptly
execute any release or other document and/or take such other action under or in relation to any Debt
Document (or any asset subject or expressed to be subject to any security document) as is requested in order
to complete, implement or facilitate such matters.

**Bank Line of Credit in Relation to a Guarantee for UEFA Broadcasting Rights**

In July 2017, UniCredit Bank Serbia JSC Belgrade issued two lines of credit (one RSD line and one EUR
line) to United Media S.à r.l. up to an amount of €24,644,000 each, for the purpose of issuing bank guarantees
for the benefit of UEFA in relation to broadcasting rights. The availability period for the issuance of
guarantees under the RSD line expired on August 6, 2017, and the availability period for guarantees under the
EUR line expired on September 28, 2017. The guarantees expired on July 1, 2021 and the agreement was not
renewed. The fee payable was 0.2% of the amount of an issued guarantee, payable quarterly, from the date of
issuance of a guarantee until its expiration date. As security for repayment under the agreements, United
Group B.V. issued a corporate guarantee valid until August 31, 2021. The credit lines contained a change of
control provision that imposed an obligation on United Media S.à r.l. to make available to the lender a cash
deposit of 50% of the outstanding amount of the guarantee as security in the event that KKR Private Equity
directly or indirectly ceased to hold a majority stake in United Media S.à r.l., which occurred as a result of the
United Group Acquisition. The lines of credit contained an undertaking by United Media S.à r.l not to issue
any guarantee in favor of third parties or borrow from third parties without prior written notification to the
lender.

The following is a summary of the material provisions of the SSN Indenture, the Security Documents and the
Existing Intercreditor Agreement, and does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to, all provisions of the SSN Indenture, the Security Documents and the Existing
Intercreditor Agreement, respectively. Because this is a summary, it may not contain all the information that
is important to you. You should refer to the Senior Secured Notes, the SSN Indenture, the Security Documents
and the Existing Intercreditor Agreement for complete descriptions of the obligations of the Company and
the SSN Issuer and your rights.

**Brief Description of the Senior Secured Notes and the SSN Guarantees**

**_The Senior Secured Notes_**

The Senior Secured Notes will, upon issuance:

on a first-priority basis (subject to certain exceptions) along with obligations under the Existing Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement (although any liabilities in respect of obligations under the Existing Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement will, and certain future hedging agreements and certain other indebtedness that
is secured by the Collateral may, receive priority over the Senior Secured Notes with respect to any proceeds
received upon any enforcement action over the Collateral);


-----

- be senior in right of payment to any indebtedness of the SSN Issuer that is expressly subordinated in right
of payment to the Senior Secured Notes;

**_The SSN Guarantees_**

The SSN Guarantees will, upon issuance:

- be the senior obligations of the relevant SSN Guarantor, which will be secured by the SSN Collateral
described below under “—Security for the Senior Secured Notes”on a first-priority basis (subject to certain
exceptions) along with obligations under the Existing Senior Secured Notes and the Existing Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement (although any liabilities in respect of obligations under the Existing Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement will, and certain future hedging agreements and other indebtedness that is
secured by the Collateral may, receive priority over the SSN Guarantees with respect to any proceeds
received upon any enforcement action over the Collateral);

- be senior in right of payment to any indebtedness of the relevant SSN Guarantor that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the SSN Guarantee;

- be effectively senior in right of payment to any existing or future unsecured obligations of the relevant SSN
Guarantor, to the extent of the value of the Collateral that is available to satisfy the obligations under the
Senior Secured Notes;

secured by property or assets that do not secure its SSN Guarantee to the extent of the value of the property
and assets securing such obligations;

- be structurally subordinated to all existing and future obligations of the Subsidiaries of the relevant SSN
Guarantor that do not Guarantee the Senior Secured Notes;

- be subject to limitations described herein, in “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees
_and the Security Interests” and in “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the New Notes, the Guarantees and the_
_Collateral—Each Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and_

covenants described under the headings “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Liens”), the SSN Issuer will be permitted to issue an unlimited principal amount of_
additional Senior Secured Notes (“Additional Senior Secured Notes”), and additional senior secured notes of
other series under the SSN Indenture, which shall have terms substantially identical to the Senior Secured

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Senior Secured Notes;

(3) the date or dates on which such Additional Senior Secured Notes will be issued;

Indenture), the 2026 SSNs, the 2026 FRNs, 2027 SSNs and the 2028 SSNs and any other additional notes of
another series issued under the SSN Indenture will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the SSN
Indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase, except as
otherwise provided in the SSN Indenture; provided that unless such Additional Senior Secured Notes, as
applicable, are issued with a separate identification number, such Additional Senior Secured Notes shall be
fungible with the relevant series of Senior Secured Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Unless the
context otherwise requires, references to the “Senior Secured Notes” for all purposes of the SSN Indenture


-----

and this “Description of the New Notes” include references to any Additional Senior Secured Notes and any
other series of senior secured notes that are issued under the SSN Indenture and book-entry interests therein.

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Senior Secured Notes**

Principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts (as defined herein), if any, on the Global Senior
Secured Notes will be payable through one or more Paying Agents by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to Euroclear or Clearstream, which will credit the account specified by the Holder (being the common
depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream or its nominee).

Principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities (“Definitive
_Registered Senior Secured Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying_
Agents maintained for such purposes. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes
may be paid, at the option of the SSN Issuer, by the Paying Agent by wire transfer to the Holders entitled
thereto as shown on the register of Holders for the Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes. See “—Paying
_Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Senior Secured Notes.”_

**Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Senior Secured Notes**

The SSN Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a “Paying Agent”) for the Senior Secured
Notes for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are held in registered form. The initial Paying Agent is Elavon
Financial Services DAC.

The SSN Issuer also maintains a registrar (the “Registrar”) and a transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”). The
initial Registrar will be Elavon Financial Services DAC and the initial Transfer Agent will be Elavon Financial
Services DAC. The Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent, as applicable, will maintain a register
reflecting ownership of Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and
will make payments on and facilitate transfers of Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes on behalf of the
SSN Issuer.

The SSN Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent for the Senior Secured Notes
without prior notice to the Holders. The SSN Issuer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may act as
Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the Senior Secured Notes.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Senior Secured Notes will initially be issued as follows:

- Senior Secured Notes sold to U.S. persons and within the United States, in each case, to qualified
institutional buyers, pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or
more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Senior Secured
_Notes”)._

- The 144A Global Senior Secured Notes will, upon issuance, be deposited with, and registered in the name
of the nominee for, the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

- Senior Secured Notes sold outside the United States to non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S under
the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest
coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Senior Secured Notes” and, together with the 144A Global
Senior Secured Notes, the “Global Senior Secured Notes”).

- The Regulation S Global Senior Secured Notes will, upon issuance, be deposited with, and registered in the
name of the nominee for, the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Senior Secured Notes (“Book-entry Interests”) will be limited to persons
that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such
participants. Ownership of interests in the Book-entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the
restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under
“Transfer Restrictions.” In addition, transfers of Book-entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or
participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, pursuant to customary
procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, and their respective participants.

Book-entry Interests in the 144A Global Senior Secured Notes may be transferred to a person who takes
delivery in the form of Book-entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Senior Secured Notes only upon


-----

delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the SSN Indenture) to the effect
that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

No Book-entry Interest in any Global Senior Secured Note representing the Senior Secured Notes may be
transferred or exchanged for any Book-entry Interest in any global note representing another series of senior
secured notes issued under the SSN Indenture.

Prior to 40 days after the date of initial issuance of the Senior Secured Notes, ownership of Book-entry
Interests in Regulation S Global Senior Secured Notes will be limited to persons that have accounts with
Euroclear or Clearstream or persons who hold interests through Euroclear or Clearstream, and any sale or
transfer of such interest to U.S. persons shall not be permitted during such period unless such resale or transfer
is made pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Subject to the foregoing, Book-entry Interests in the
Regulation S Global Senior Secured Notes may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of
Book-entry Interests in the 144A Global Senior Secured Notes only upon delivery by the transferor of a
written certification (in the form provided in the SSN Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made
_to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of_
Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the
transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable securities
law of any other jurisdiction.

Any Book-entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Book-entry Interest in the Global Senior Secured Note from which it was transferred
and will become a Book-entry Interest in the Global Senior Secured Note to which it was transferred.
Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other
procedures applicable to Book-entry Interests in the Global Senior Secured Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations
of €100,000 in aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by
the Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required
by the SSN Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear
or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant that owns the relevant Book-entry Interests. Definitive
Registered Senior Secured Notes issued in exchange for a Book-entry Interest will, except as set forth in the
SSN Indenture or as otherwise determined by the SSN Issuer to be in compliance with applicable law, be
subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below.

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Senior Secured Notes issued as Definitive Registered
Senior Secured Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of
€100,000 in aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with
any such transfer or exchange, the SSN Indenture requires the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among
other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the
account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, to furnish certain certificates and
opinions, and to pay any taxes, duties and governmental charges in connection with such transfer or exchange.
Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any taxes, duties and
governmental charges payable in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Registrar and Transfer Agent are not required to register the transfer or
exchange of any Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes:

(1) for a period of 15-days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of such Definitive Registered Senior
Secured Notes;

(2) for a period of 15-days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of such Definitive Registered
Senior Secured Notes to be redeemed in part; or

(3) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of
Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer (each, as defined herein).

The SSN Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent and the Paying Agent will be entitled to treat
the Holder of a Senior Secured Note as the owner of it for all purposes.

**SSN Guarantees**

The obligations of the SSN Issuer pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes will (subject to the Agreed Security
Principles) be guaranteed, jointly and severally on a senior secured basis, (i) on the New Notes Issue Date, by


-----

the Company and (ii) within 120 days following (and not including) the New Notes Issue Date, by the United
Group SSN Guarantors and the Vivacom SSN Guarantors (such guarantee, or any other Guarantee of the
Senior Secured Notes provided from time to time, a “SSN Guarantee”).

The SSN Guarantors and their respective jurisdictions of incorporation are as follows:

Each SSN Guarantee will be subject to the Agreed Security Principles, which include restrictions on the
granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or
other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, “thin
capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and similar matters. Each SSN Guarantee will also be limited to
the maximum amount that would not render the SSN Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under
applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of
foreign or state law. By virtue of these limitation, a SSN Guarantor’s obligation under its SSN Guarantee
could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, or a SSN Guarantor
may have effectively no obligation under its SSN Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the New
_Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—Each Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain_
_limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its_
_validity and enforceability.” and “—Our subsidiaries located in Serbia, as well as other subsidiaries representing_
_a significant portion of our revenue and EBITDA, will not guarantee the New Notes and each of the Guarantees_
_will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities and preference shares (if any) of our non-Guarantor_
_subsidiaries.”_

The SSN Guarantee of a SSN Guarantor will terminate and be released:

- except in the case of the SSN Guarantee by the Company, upon a sale, exchange, transfer or other
disposition (including by way of consolidation, merger or amalgamation) of ownership interests in the
SSN Guarantor (directly or through a parent company) such that the SSN Guarantor does not remain a
Restricted Subsidiary, or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the SSN Guarantor
(other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary), in each case if such sale, exchange, transfer or
other disposition does not violate the SSN Indenture, the Existing Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein);

- except in the case of the SSN Guarantee by the Company, upon the designation in accordance with the
SSN Indenture of the SSN Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

- upon defeasance or discharge of the Senior Secured Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and
“—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

- except in the case of the SSN Guarantee by the Company, with respect to a SSN Guarantor that is not a
Significant Subsidiary, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to the extent that
such SSN Guarantor (i) is unconditionally released and discharged from its liability with respect to the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and (ii) is not Guaranteeing any other Credit Facility or
Public Debt of the Company or another SSN Guarantor at the time;

- in accordance with the provisions of the Existing Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

- as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;


-----

- as described under the second paragraph of the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Issuance of Guarantees of Indebtedness”;_

- with respect to any SSN Guarantor which is not the continuing or surviving Person in the relevant
consolidation or merger, as a result of a transaction not prohibited by “—Certain Covenants—Merger and
_Consolidation—Subsidiary SSN Guarantors” and the SSN Indenture; or_

- with respect to any SSN Guarantor, in connection with a solvent liquidation of such SSN Guarantor
pursuant to which substantially all of the assets of such SSN Guarantor remain owned by the SSN Issuer,
the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary.

Substantially all the operations of the Company and the SSN Issuer are conducted through their Subsidiaries.
Claims of creditors of Subsidiaries that are not SSN Guarantors, including trade creditors, secured creditors
and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority
stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries, generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings
of those Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the SSN Issuer and the SSN Guarantors, including the
Holders. The Senior Secured Notes and each SSN Guarantee therefore will be effectively subordinated to
creditors (including trade and secured creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of
Subsidiaries of the Company. For the twelve months ended and as of September 30, 2020, (i) the SSN Issuer
and the SSN Guarantors generated 32% of the Company’s consolidated revenue and 38% of the Company’s
consolidated EBITDA, (ii) the Company’s Subsidiaries (including the Issuer and the other SSN Guarantors)
had a net loss of €76,043 million, compared to a consolidated net loss of €73,471 million for the Company
and (iii) the SSN Issuer and the SSN Guarantors represented 21% of the Company’s consolidated total assets
(excluding goodwill).

The Company’s subsidiaries organized in Serbia, North Macedonia, Greece, Croatia, Montenegro, Malta,
Cyprus, Switzerland and Canada, and certain of the Company’s subsidiaries organized in Slovenia, will not
guarantee the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes. Although the SSN Indenture limits the incurrence
of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject
to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the SSN Indenture does not impose any limitation on the
incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock under the SSN Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

**Security**

**_The Collateral_**

Pursuant to the Security Documents, the SSN Issuer and the SSN Guarantors have granted or (as applicable)
will grant in favor of the Security Agents liens and security interests, subject to the operation of the Agreed
Security Principles, certain perfection requirements and any Permitted Collateral Liens, over certain of their
assets, as listed below:

On or about the New Notes Issue Date, the SSN Issuer and the Company, as applicable, have granted or (as
applicable) will grant security over, subject to the operation of the Agreed Security Principles, certain
perfection requirements and any Permitted Collateral Liens:

- shares of the SSN Issuer, Adria Serbia Holdco B.V. and Adria Cable B.V.;

- certain bank accounts of the SSN Issuer and the Company; and

- certain receivables owing to the SSN Issuer (collectively, the “Issue Date SSN Collateral”).

In addition, pursuant to Security Documents to be entered into within 120 days following (and not including)
the New Notes Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes and the SSN Guarantees are expected to be secured by
the following assets, subject to the operation of the Agreed Security Principles, certain perfection requirements
and any Permitted Collateral Liens:

- shares of Adria Media B.V., Slovenia Broadband S.à r.l., Bosnia Broadband S.à r.l., Telemach d.o.o.,
Telemach UG d.o.o. and Telemach BH d.o.o. Sarajevo;

- shares or ownership stakes of Serbia Broadband—Srpske Kablovske Mreže d.o.o. Beograd (Voždovac)
owned by Adria Serbia Holdco B.V.;

- certain bank accounts of Adria Serbia Holdco B.V., Adria Cable B.V., Adria Media B.V., Slovenia
Broadband S.à r.l., Bosnia Broadband S.à r.l. and Telemach BH d.o.o. Sarajevo;


-----

- blank signed bills of exchange and bills of exchange authorizations issued by Telemach d.o.o. and Telemach
UG d.o.o.; and

- certain receivables owing to Adria Cable B.V., Slovenia Broadband S.à r.l., Bosnia Broadband S.à r.l. and
Telemach d.o.o. in respect of intercompany loans (collectively, the “Post-Issue Date SSN Collateral”); and

- the shares of each Vivacom Guarantor,

subject, in each case, to the operation of the Agreed Security Principles, certain perfection requirements and
any Permitted Collateral Liens (the “Vivacom SSN Collateral” and, together with the Issue Date SSN
Collateral, the Post-Issue Date SSN Collateral and any and all other assets from time to time in which a
security interest has been or will be granted pursuant to any Security Document to secure obligations under
the SSN Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes, the “Collateral”). For a summary of the Agreed Security
Principles, see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Existing Revolving Credit Facility
_Agreement.”_

The Collateral granted in relation to the Senior Secured Notes also secures or will secure the liabilities under
the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Existing Senior Secured Notes and may secure
Operating Facilities and Hedging Agreements and other indebtedness (including any Additional Senior
Secured Notes and any other series of senior secured notes issued under the Indenture). Pursuant to the
Existing Intercreditor Agreement, any liabilities in respect of obligations under the Existing Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement and certain Operating Facilities and certain Hedging Obligations permitted to be incurred
under the covenant “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and permitted to be secured on the
Collateral on a super priority basis (see “—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens”) will receive
priority over the Holders with respect to any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any
Collateral. Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest,”the SSN Issuer is permitted to grant security over the Collateral_
in connection with future issuances of its Indebtedness (including any Additional Senior Secured Notes) or
Indebtedness of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, in each case, as not prohibited under the SSN
Indenture and the Existing Intercreditor Agreement. Any proceeds received upon any enforcement over any
Collateral, after all liabilities in respect of obligations under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
and certain Operating Facilities and certain Hedging Obligations have been discharged from such recoveries,
will be applied pro rata in payment of all liabilities in respect of obligations under the SSN Indenture and the
Senior Secured Notes and any other Indebtedness of the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries permitted to
be incurred and secured by the Collateral pursuant to the SSN Indenture and the Existing Intercreditor
Agreement (including the Existing Senior Secured Notes).

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitations on Liens” and “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest,” the SSN_
Issuer is permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with future issuances of its Indebtedness,
including any Additional Senior Secured Notes, or Indebtedness of the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries, in each case, as permitted under the SSN Indenture.

**_Administration of Security and Enforcement of Liens_**

The Security Documents and the Collateral will be administered by the Security Agent, in each case pursuant
to the Existing Intercreditor Agreement, for the benefit of all holders of the SSN Issuer’s obligations secured
by such Collateral. In addition, in certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and jurisprudence governing the
creation and perfection of security interests, the Existing Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation
of a parallel debt which will form part of the secured obligation. The parallel debt construct has not been
tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions, including the Netherlands. The enforcement of the Security
Documents will be subject to the procedures set forth in the Existing Intercreditor Agreement. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to the New Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—Each Guarantee and security_
_interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to_
_certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.” and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of_
_the Guarantees and the Security Interests.” For a description of the Existing Intercreditor Agreement, see_
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Existing Intercreditor Agreement.”

The Security Documents will be governed by the laws of the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Slovenia, Serbia,
Bosnia and Herzegovina and Bulgaria. The Liens on the Collateral, and the ability of the Security Agent to
realize upon the Collateral, will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or
imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to


-----

fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit,
capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or
other considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations, see “Limitations on
_Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.” In addition, the enforcement of the_
Collateral will be limited to the maximum amount required under the Agreed Security Principles to comply
with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. As a result of these limitations, the enforceable
amount of the SSN Issuer’s obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and a SSN Guarantor’s obligation
under its SSN Guarantee could be significantly less than the total amounts payable with respect to the Senior
Secured Notes, or a SSN Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under the SSN Guarantee. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to the New Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—Each Guarantee and security_
_interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to_
_certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.”_

Subject to the terms of the Security Documents, the SSN Issuer, the SSN Guarantors and any other Collateral
provider will have the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the
Senior Secured Notes (other than as set forth in the Security Documents), to freely operate the Collateral and
to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom.

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the pledgors_
of the Collateral will be permitted to pledge the Collateral in connection with future issuances of Indebtedness
of the Company or the Restricted Subsidiaries, including any Additional Senior Secured Notes, not prohibited
by the SSN Indenture.

No appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the SSN Issuer in connection
with the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes. There can be no assurance that the proceeds from the sale of
the Collateral, in whole or in part, pursuant to the SSN Indenture and the Security Documents following an
Event of Default, would be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders and the obligations owed
under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Existing Senior Secured Notes, any Operating
Facilities and any Hedging Obligations. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may
have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral can be
sold in a short period of time or at all. In addition, the Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain
circumstances, including the issuance of Additional Senior Secured Notes and the disposition of assets
comprising the Collateral, subject to the terms of the SSN Indenture. Please see the section entitled “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to the New Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The New Notes will be secured_
_only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that has been granted as security for such Notes and future_
_secured indebtedness may be secured by certain assets that do not secure such Notes; in the event that the_
_Collateral is enforced, the lenders under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, counterparties of certain hedging_
_obligations and creditors for other super priority indebtedness will be paid with the proceeds from the enforcement_
_of Collateral in priority to the holders of the New Notes.”_

In addition, the Existing Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will place limitations on the
ability of the Security Agent to cause the sale of some or all of the Collateral. These limitations may include
requirements that some or all of the Collateral be disposed of only pursuant to public auctions or only at a
price confirmed by a valuation in certain circumstances. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Existing Intercreditor Agreement.”_

The Trustee for the Senior Secured Notes has, and by accepting a Senior Secured Note, each Holder will be
deemed to have:

- irrevocably appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent under the Existing Intercreditor Agreement and
the other relevant documents to which it is a party (including, without limitation, the Security Documents);

- irrevocably authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and
discretions that are specifically given to it under the Existing Intercreditor Agreement or other documents
to which it is a party (including, without limitation, the Security Documents), together with any other
incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each document, waiver, modification, amendment,
renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Security Agent on its behalf; and

- accepted the terms and conditions of the Existing Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and authorized the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional
Intercreditor Agreement.


-----

The SSN Indenture provides that the Security Documents may be enforced only upon an acceleration of the
amounts due under the Senior Secured Notes following an Event of Default. The Indenture also provides
that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, only the Security Agent will have the right to enforce the
Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee, the Holders and any other secured parties. As a consequence of
such contractual provisions, Holders will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral
securing the Senior Secured Notes, except through the Trustee under the SSN Indenture, who will (subject to
the provisions of the SSN Indenture, the Existing Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security
Documents) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the Collateral. Neither the Trustee nor
the Holders may, individually or collectively, take any direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under
the Security Documents. The Trustee and the Holders may only act through the Security Agent. The Trustee
and the Security Agent will agree to any release of the security interests created by the Security Documents
that is in accordance with the SSN Indenture and the Existing Intercreditor Agreement without requiring any
consent of the Holders.

The SSN Indenture provides that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Existing Intercreditor Agreement
and the Security Documents, the Senior Secured Notes and the SSN Indenture, as applicable, will be secured
by security interests in the Collateral until all obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the SSN
Indenture have been discharged. However, the Security Interests with respect to the Senior Secured Notes and
the SSN Indenture may be released under certain circumstances as provided under “—Release of Liens.”

**_Release of Liens_**

The Security Agent and the Trustee (but only to the extent required or necessary) will take any action required
to effectuate any release of Collateral required by a Security Document:

(1) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations in respect of the Senior Secured
Notes issued under the SSN Indenture or discharge or defeasance thereof in accordance with the SSN
Indenture;

(2) upon release of a SSN Guarantee (with respect to the Liens securing such SSN Guarantee granted by
such SSN Guarantor) in accordance with the SSN Indenture;

(3) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral, directly or indirectly, to (a) any Person
other than the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (but excluding any transaction subject to
“—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The SSN Issuer and the Company”) that is not
prohibited by the SSN Indenture (with respect to the Lien on such Collateral) or (b) the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary consistent with the Existing Intercreditor Agreement;

(4) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(5) automatically without any action by the Trustee or Security Agent, if the Lien granted in favor of the
Credit Facility, Public Debt or such other Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary that
gave rise to the obligation to grant the Lien over such Collateral is released;

(6) in order to effectuate a merger, consolidation, conveyance or transfer conducted in compliance with the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”;

(7) with respect to assets held by or the Capital Stock of any Restricted Subsidiary, in connection with a
solvent liquidation of such Restricted Subsidiary, pursuant to which substantially all of the assets of
such Restricted Subsidiary remain owned by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary; and

(8) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the SSN Indenture (including in accordance with “—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest”), the Existing Intercreditor Agreement or the relevant_
Security Documents.

Each of these releases shall be effected by the Security Agent and, to the extent required or necessary, the
Trustee, without the consent of the Holders.

The SSN Issuer, the Company, the other Restricted Subsidiaries and any other Collateral provider may also,
among other things, without any release or consent by the Trustee or the Security Agent, conduct ordinary
course activities with respect to the Collateral, including, without limitation, (i) selling or otherwise disposing
of, in any transaction or series of related transactions, any property subject to the Lien under the Security
Documents which has become worn out, defective or obsolete or not used or useful in the business; (ii) selling,


-----

transferring or otherwise disposing of current assets in the ordinary course of business; and (iii) any other
action permitted by the Security Documents or the Existing Intercreditor Agreement.

**Amendments to the Existing Intercreditor Agreement and Additional Intercreditor Agreements**

In connection with the Incurrence of any Indebtedness by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
that is permitted to share the Collateral, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall, at the request of the
Company or the SSN Issuer, enter into with the Company or the SSN Issuer (as applicable), the relevant
Restricted Subsidiaries and the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized representatives) one or
more intercreditor agreements or deeds (including a restatement, replacement, amendment or other
modification of the Existing Intercreditor Agreement) (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”), on
substantially the same terms as the Existing Intercreditor Agreement (or terms that are not materially less
favorable to the Holders) and substantially similar as applies to sharing of the proceeds of security and
enforcement of security, priority and release of security; provided that such Additional Intercreditor
Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or adversely affect the
personal rights, duties, liabilities, indemnification or immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent under
the SSN Indenture or the Existing Intercreditor Agreement. In connection with the foregoing, the Company
or the SSN Issuer (as applicable) shall furnish to the Trustee such documentation in relation thereto as it may
reasonably require. As used herein, a reference to the Existing Intercreditor Agreement will also include any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

In relation to the Existing Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee shall consent on behalf of the Holders to the
payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any
obligations subordinated to the Senior Secured Notes thereby; provided, however, that such transaction would
comply with the covenant described herein under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

The SSN Indenture also provides that, at the written direction of the SSN Issuer and without the consent of
Holders, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the
Existing Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity,
omission, defect or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness
covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries that is
subject to any such agreement (provided that such Indebtedness is Incurred in compliance with the SSN
Indenture), (3) add SSN Guarantors or other Restricted Subsidiaries to such agreement, (4) further secure the
Senior Secured Notes (including Additional Senior Secured Notes), (5) make provision to implement any
Permitted Collateral Liens in accordance with the terms of the SSN Indenture or (6) make any other change
to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect.

The SSN Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or Security Agent to enter into any amendment to any
Existing Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the
Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding, except as
otherwise permitted below under “—Amendments and Waivers”or as permitted by the terms of such Existing
Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, and the SSN Issuer may only direct the
Trustee or Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any
personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent,
adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under the SSN Indenture or Existing
Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The SSN Indenture also provides that each Holder, by accepting a Senior Secured Note, shall be deemed to
have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Existing Intercreditor Agreement (whether then
entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have authorized
the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into the Existing Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement on each Holder’s behalf.

**IPO Pushdown**

(1) On, in contemplation of, or following an Initial Public Offering, the Company or the SSN Issuer shall be
entitled to require (by written notice to the Trustee and the Security Agent (a “Pushdown Notice”)) that
the terms of the SSN Indenture and the Existing Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) shall operate (with effect from the date specified in the relevant Pushdown
Notice) on the basis that: (i) references to the Company and Restricted Subsidiaries (and all related
provisions) shall apply only to the IPO Pushdown Entity and its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to
time, although the SSN Issuer shall remain the same entity; (ii) all financial ratio, basket calculations and


-----

financial definitions shall exclude any holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity and all reporting
obligations shall be assumed at the level of the IPO Pushdown Entity (or the SSN Issuer, if so elected);
(iii) each reference in the SSN Indenture and/or the Existing Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) to the “Company” shall be deemed to be a reference to the IPO Pushdown
Entity (to the extent applicable and unless the context requires otherwise, and provided further that
nothing in this paragraph (1), including the deeming construct contemplated by this sub-paragraph
(iii) and any action taken by the IPO Pushdown Entity prior to it being deemed to be the Company or the
SSN Issuer, shall, or shall be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any
covenant or other term in the SSN Indenture or a Default or an Event of Default); (iv) none of the
representations, warranties, undertakings, covenants or Events of Default in the SSN Indenture, the
Existing Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or the Security
Documents shall apply to any entity of which the IPO Pushdown Entity is a Subsidiary (whether in its
capacity as a SSN Guarantor or otherwise); (v) no event, matter or circumstance relating to any holding
company of the IPO Pushdown Entity (whether in its capacity as a SSN Guarantor or otherwise) shall,
or shall be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any covenant or other term
in the SSN Indenture or a Default or an Event of Default; (vi) each holding company of the IPO
Pushdown Entity shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released from all obligations under the SSN
Indenture, the Existing Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and any
security granted by any such holding company; (vii) unless otherwise notified by the Company or the
SSN Issuer: (A) each person which is party to the Existing Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) as an “Investor” shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released from the
Existing Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and all obligations and
restrictions under the Existing Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement)
(and from the date specified by the Company or the SSN Issuer that person shall cease to be party to the
Existing Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an Investor and shall
have no further rights or obligations under the Existing Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) as an Investor); and (B) there shall be no obligation or requirement for any
person to become party to the Existing Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) as an Investor; and (viii) in the event that any person is released from or does not become
party to the Existing Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an Investor
as a consequence of this paragraph (1), any term of the SSN Indenture and/or the Existing Intercreditor
Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) which requires or assumes that any person be
an Investor or that any liabilities or obligations to such person be subject to the Existing Intercreditor
Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or otherwise subordinated shall cease to apply.
A Pushdown Notice may not be delivered if a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing
(disregarding any Default or Event of Default that could be deemed to arise in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this provision).

(2) The Trustee and the Security Agent shall be required to enter into any amendment to the SSN Indenture
or amendment to or replacement of the Existing Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) or the Security Documents required by the Company or the SSN Issuer and/or
take such other action as is required by the Company or the SSN Issuer in order to facilitate or reflect any
of the matters contemplated by paragraph (1) above; provided that such amendment, replacement or
other document or instrument does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security
Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent (as applicable), does not affect the rights, duties,
liabilities, indemnities or immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent (as applicable) under such
amendment, replacement or other document or instrument. The Trustee and the Security Agent are each
irrevocably authorized and instructed by the Holders (without any consent by the Holders) to execute
any such amended or replacement documents and/or take other such action on behalf of the Holders
(and shall do so on the request of and at the cost of the Company or the SSN Issuer).

(3) For the purpose of this covenant, the “IPO Pushdown Entity” shall be any Restricted Subsidiary of the
Company notified to the Trustee by the Company or the SSN Issuer in writing as the person to be treated
as the IPO Pushdown Entity in relation to the relevant Initial Public Offering, provided that: (i) the IPO
Pushdown Entity shall be a Restricted Subsidiary which will issue shares, or whose shares are to be sold,
pursuant to that Initial Public Offering (or a holding company of such Restricted Subsidiary); and (ii) the
Company or the SSN Issuer may not designate a Subsidiary of the SSN Issuer as the IPO Pushdown
Entity.

(4) If the Company or the SSN Issuer delivers a Pushdown Notice to the Trustee and Security Agent
pursuant to paragraph (1) above in relation to a contemplated Initial Public Offering, it shall be entitled


-----

to revoke that Pushdown Notice at any time prior to the occurrence of the relevant Initial Public Offering
by written notice to the Trustee and Security Agent. In the event that any Pushdown Notice is revoked in
accordance with this paragraph (4): (i) the provisions of sub-paragraphs (1)(i) to (1)(vii) above shall cease
to apply in relation to that Pushdown Notice; (ii) if any security has been released pursuant to paragraph
(1) above in reliance on that Pushdown Notice, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Company
or the SSN Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary shall as soon as reasonably practicable execute a
replacement Security Document in respect of that security; and (iii) if any person party to the Existing
Intercreditor Agreement as an “Investor” has been released from the Existing Intercreditor Agreement
pursuant to sub-paragraph (1)(vii) above in reliance on that Pushdown Notice, and the Trustee has
received notice of such “Investor”released parties, the Trustee shall request by prior written notice to the
Company or the SSN Issuer and that person, that person shall as soon as reasonably practicable accede
to the Existing Intercreditor Agreement as an Investor.

For the avoidance of doubt: (A) nothing in this paragraph (4) shall prohibit or otherwise restrict the Company
or the SSN Issuer from delivering a further Pushdown Notice in relation to any actual or contemplated Initial
Public Offering; and (B) revocation of a Pushdown Notice shall not, and shall not be deemed to, directly or
indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking or other term in the
SSN Indenture or the Existing Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or a
Default or an Event of Default (whether by reason of any action or step taken by any person, or any matter
or circumstance arising or committed, while that Pushdown Notice was effective or otherwise).

**Optional Redemption**

**_Optional Redemption of the Senior Secured Notes_**

Except as set forth herein and under “—Redemption for Taxation Reasons,” the Senior Secured Notes are not
redeemable at the option of the SSN Issuer prior to their maturity date.

At any time prior to, 2024, the SSN Issuer may redeem the Senior Secured Notes, in whole or in
part, at its option, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice as described under “—Selection and
Notice,” at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes plus the
Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Senior
Secured Notes redeemed to, but excluding, the redemption date.

At any time and from time to time prior to, 2024, the SSN Issuer may on any one or more
occasions redeem during each calendar year up to 10% of the original principal amount of the Senior Secured
Notes (including the original principal amount of any Additional Senior Secured Notes), upon not less than
10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at a redemption price of 103% of the principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Senior
Secured Notes redeemed to, but excluding, the redemption date.

At any time and from time to time prior to, 2024, the SSN Issuer may redeem the Senior Secured
Notes, upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” with the Net Cash Proceeds received by the
SSN Issuer from any Equity Offering at a redemption price equal to 104% plus accrued and unpaid interest
and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the redemption date in an aggregate principal amount for
all such redemptions not to exceed 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured
Notes (including the original principal amount of any Additional Senior Secured Notes); provided that:

(1) in each case the redemption takes place not later than 180 days after the closing of the related Equity
Offering; and

(2) not less than 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (including
Additional Senior Secured Notes) issued under the SSN Indenture remains outstanding immediately
thereafter (excluding Senior Secured Notes held by the SSN Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries),
unless all Senior Secured Notes are redeemed substantially concurrently.

At any time and from time to time on or after, 2024, the SSN Issuer may redeem the Senior
Secured Notes in whole or in part, upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at a redemption
price equal to the percentage of principal amount set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on
the Senior Secured Notes redeemed, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date and Additional
Amounts, if any, if redeemed during the twelve month period beginning on, of the year indicated
below:

**_General_**

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice” below. Any redemption
may, at the SSN Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent
(including, but not limited to, an Equity Offering, an Incurrence of Indebtedness or a Change of Control) as
set out in the notice of redemption. In addition, if such redemption or notice is subject to satisfaction of one
or more conditions precedent, such notice may state that, at the SSN Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date
may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption may not
occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been
satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed; provided that in no case shall the
notice have been delivered less than 10 days or more than 60 days prior to the date on which such redemption
(if any) occurs. In addition, the SSN Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price
and performance of the SSN Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by
another Person.

The Company, its Subsidiaries (including the SSN Issuer) and its and their Affiliates may repurchase Senior
Secured Notes at any time and from time to time. Any such purchases may be made through open market or
privately negotiated transactions with third parties or pursuant to one or more tender or exchange offers or
otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as well as with such consideration as the Company, its
Subsidiaries (including the SSN Issuer) and its and their Affiliates may determine.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for any class of the Senior Secured Notes,
including a Change of Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, if Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate
principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes of such class validly tender and do not
withdraw their Senior Secured Notes and the SSN Issuer (or any other person making such tender offer)
purchases all of the Senior Secured Notes of such class validly tendered and not withdrawn, the SSN Issuer
(or such other person making such tender offer), within 30 days of such purchase, may redeem all (but not less
than all) of the Senior Secured Notes of that class that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price
equal to the price paid to any other holders in such tender offer (other than any early tender premium,
incentive payment or similar payment), plus, to the extent not included in the purchase price, accrued and
unpaid interest. In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the
then outstanding Senior Secured Notes of such class have validly tendered and not withdrawn such Senior
Secured Notes, Senior Secured Notes owned by an Affiliate of the Company or by funds controlled, managed
or advised by any Affiliate of the Company, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding and
to have been tendered for the purposes of such tender offer or other offer, as applicable.

**_Sinking Fund_**

The SSN Issuer will not be required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with
respect to the Senior Secured Notes prior to their maturity date.

**Selection and Notice**

If fewer than all of a class of the Senior Secured Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and
Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to
prevent fractions) or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate unless otherwise required by law
or applicable stock exchange or depositary requirements; provided that no Senior Secured Note of €100,000 in
aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part and only Senior Secured Notes in integral
multiples of €1,000 will be redeemed. None of the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar or any other agent
will be liable for any selections made in accordance with this paragraph.

Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first class mail at least 10 days but not
more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Senior Secured Notes at the address of such
Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream, except that redemption notices may be delivered electronically or mailed more


-----

than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Senior
Secured Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the SSN Indenture.

If and for so long as any Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the
extent the rules of the Authority so require, the SSN Issuer will notify the Authority of any such notice to the
Holders and, in connection with any redemption, the SSN Issuer will notify the Authority of any change in
the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes outstanding.

If any Senior Secured Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Senior
Secured Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a Definitive
Registered Senior Secured Note, a new Definitive Registered Senior Secured Note in principal amount equal
to the unredeemed portion of any Definitive Registered Senior Secured Note redeemed in part will be issued
in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Definitive Registered Senior Secured
Note. In the case of a Global Senior Secured Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Senior
Secured Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof.
Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice (including any conditions contained therein), Senior
Secured Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. Unless the SSN Issuer
defaults in the payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date interest will cease to accrue
on Senior Secured Notes or portions of Senior Secured Notes called for redemption.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The SSN Issuer may redeem a class of Senior Secured Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving
not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’notice to the Holders (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption
price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the
date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts, if any,
then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise,
if any, if the SSN Issuer or a SSN Guarantor determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any change in, or amendment to, or the introduction of, an official position regarding the application,
administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including a holding,
judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction,

(each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

a Payor is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Senior Secured Notes would be, required to
pay any Additional Amounts (as defined in “—Withholding Taxes”) with respect to the Senior Secured Notes,
and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Payor (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable but not
including assignment of the obligation to make payment with respect to the Senior Secured Notes). In the
case of redemption due to withholding or deduction as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that
is a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined in “—Withholding Taxes”) at January 23, 2020, such Change in
Tax Law must become effective on or after January 23, 2020. In the case of redemption due to withholding or
deduction as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
after January 23, 2020, such Change in Tax Law must become effective on or after the date the jurisdiction
becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, unless the Change in Tax Law would have applied to the predecessor
of a Successor Company (as defined herein) or the predecessor of a successor of a SSN Guarantor.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be delivered in accordance with the procedures described
under “—Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given
(a) earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obliged to make such payment
of Additional Amounts if a payment in respect of the Senior Secured Notes were then due and (b) unless at
the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the
delivery or mailing of any notice of redemption of the Senior Secured Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the
SSN Issuer or a SSN Guarantor or a successor to either, where applicable, will deliver to the Trustee and the
Paying Agent (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the SSN Issuer or a SSN Guarantor or a successor to
either, where applicable, is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing
that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied and (b) an opinion of an independent


-----

tax counsel of recognized standing to the effect that the SSN Issuer or a SSN Guarantor or a successor to
either, where applicable, has or have been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of
a Change in Tax Law.

The Trustee and the Paying Agent will accept such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of
the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in which event it will be
conclusive and binding on the Holders.

The foregoing provisions will apply mutatis mutandis to the laws and official positions of any jurisdiction in
which any successor to the SSN Issuer is incorporated or organized or otherwise considered to be a resident
for tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or through which such successor makes any payment on the Senior
Secured Notes or any SSN Guarantees, and any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or
therein. The foregoing provisions will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the SSN Indenture.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by the SSN Issuer or any SSN Guarantor or any successor entity to either (a “Payor”) in
respect of the Senior Secured Notes or with respect to any SSN Guarantee, as applicable, will be made free
and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or
deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any
Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) the Netherlands or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or therein having power
to tax;

(2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Senior Secured Note is made by the Payor
or its agents, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power
to tax; or

(3) any other jurisdiction in which the Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax
purposes, or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or
Governmental Authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1), (2) and (3), a
“Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by a Payor or the Paying Agent with
respect to any Senior Secured Note or SSN Guarantee, including payments of principal, redemption price,
interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the
“Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by each Holder in respect
of such payments, after such withholding, or deduction (including any such deduction or withholding from
such Additional Amounts), will equal the amounts which would have been received by such Holder in respect
of such payments on any such Senior Secured Note or SSN Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or
deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any actual or deemed present or
former connection between the relevant Holder or the beneficial owner of a Senior Secured Note (or
between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over
the relevant Holder or beneficial owner, if the relevant Holder or beneficial owner is an estate, nominee,
trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
(including, without limitation, being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or resident or national
or domiciliary of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being
physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising
solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Senior Secured Note or the receipt of any
payment in respect thereof;

(2) any Tax that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner of the
Senior Secured Note to comply with a written request of the Payor addressed to the Holder or beneficial
owner after reasonable notice, (at least 30 days before any such withholding or deduction would be
made), to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality,
residence, identity or connection with the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction of the Holder or such beneficial
owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to
such matters, which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part of such Tax but, only to the extent
the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation;


-----

(3) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment on or with
respect to the Senior Secured Notes or any SSN Guarantee;

(4) any estate, inheritance, value added, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar tax,
assessment or other governmental charge;

(5) any Taxes imposed pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, any current or future regulations
or official interpretations thereof, any agreements entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b) of the Code
and any intergovernmental agreements (and related legislation or official administrative guidance)
implemented with respect to the foregoing; or

(6) any combination of the items (1) through (5) above.

Such Additional Amounts will also not be payable (x) if the payment could have been made without such
deduction or withholding if the beneficiary of the payment had presented the Senior Secured Note for
payment (where presentation is permitted or required for payment) within 15-days after the relevant payment
was first made available for payment to the Holder or (y) where, had the beneficial owner of the Senior
Secured Note been the Holder, such beneficial owner would not have been entitled to payment of Additional
Amounts by reason of any of clauses (1) to (6) inclusive above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to any payment to any Holder who is a fiduciary
or a partnership or any person other than the beneficial owner of such Senior Secured Notes, to the extent
that the beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial
owner of such Senior Secured Notes would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such
beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner held such Senior Secured Notes directly.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the relevant taxing authority in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable
law. The Payor will use all reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment
of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, in such
form as provided in the ordinary course by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and as is reasonably available to
the Payor and will provide such certified copies, or if, notwithstanding the Payor’s reasonable efforts to obtain
such tax receipts, such certified copies are not available, certified copies of other reasonable evidence of such
payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee. Such certified copies shall be made available to the
Holders upon reasonable request and will be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent.

If any Payor will be obliged to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any
Senior Secured Note or any SSN Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will
deliver to the Trustee (copying the Paying Agent) an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional
Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to
enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such
obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which
case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days
prior to the payment date). The Trustee and the Paying Agent will be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s
Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in either the SSN Indenture or this “Description of the New Notes” there are mentioned, in any
context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Senior Secured Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Senior Secured Notes,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context,
Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The SSN Issuer will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary Taxes, or any other property or
similar taxes, charges or levies that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, delivery,
registration or enforcement of any Senior Secured Notes, the SSN Indenture, the Security Documents or any
other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than, in each case, in connection with a transfer or


-----

exchange of the Senior Secured Notes) and the SSN Issuer agrees to indemnify the Holders for any such
Taxes paid by such Holders.

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the SSN Indenture and
will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to the SSN Issuer is organized or any
political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms hereof, each Holder will have the right to require the SSN
Issuer to repurchase all of such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes (equal to € 100,000 aggregate principal amount,
and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof; provided that Senior Secured Notes of €100,000 or less may
only be purchased in whole and not in part) at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount
of the Senior Secured Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but
excluding, the date of purchase; provided, however, that the SSN Issuer shall not be obligated to repurchase
Senior Secured Notes as described under this “Change of Control” section in the event and to the extent that
it has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of the Senior Secured Notes as described under
“—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived.

Unless the SSN Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Senior Secured Notes as
described under “—Optional Redemption”or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived,
no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the SSN Issuer will mail a notice (the
“Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder of any such Senior Secured Notes, with a copy to the Trustee:

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require
the SSN Issuer to purchase such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101%
of the principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on
a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”);

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date
such notice is mailed) and record date (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute
the Change of Control;

(4) describing the procedures determined by the SSN Issuer, consistent with the SSN Indenture, that a Holder
must follow in order to have its Senior Secured Notes repurchased; and

(5) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of
Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the SSN Issuer will,
to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Senior Secured Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all
Senior Secured Notes so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal
amount of Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the SSN Issuer in the Change
of Control Offer;

(4) in the case of Global Senior Secured Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent the
Global Senior Secured Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Senior Secured Notes or
portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the SSN Issuer; and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Registrar
for cancellation all Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes accepted for purchase by the SSN Issuer.

If any Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly wire to
each Holder of Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for
such Senior Secured Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate (or cause to be authenticated) and
mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes a new Senior Secured Note equal in


-----

aggregate principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Senior Secured Notes surrendered, if any;
provided that each such new Senior Secured Note will be in an aggregate principal amount that is at least
€100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

If and for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the
extent that the rules of the Authority so require, the SSN Issuer will notify the Authority of any Change of
Control Offer.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the SSN Indenture does not contain provisions
that permit the Holders to require that the SSN Issuer repurchase or redeem the Senior Secured Notes in the
event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the
SSN Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control
may deter a third-party from seeking to consummate a transaction (including the acquisition of the Company
and its Subsidiaries or the SSN Issuer and its Subsidiaries) that would constitute a Change of Control.

The SSN Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a
third-party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with
the requirements set forth under this “Change of Control” section applicable to a Change of Control Offer
made by the SSN Issuer and purchases all Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under
such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of
Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such
Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time the
Change of Control Offer is made.

The SSN Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange
Act and any other securities laws or regulations (or rules of any exchange on which the Senior Secured Notes
are then listed) in connection with the repurchase of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the
extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with provisions of
the SSN Indenture, the SSN Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations (or exchange
rules) and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations, or require a repurchase of the Senior Secured
Notes, under the Change of Control provisions of the SSN Indenture by virtue of the conflict. The SSN
Issuer may rely on any no action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not
recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

The SSN Issuer’s ability to repurchase Senior Secured Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be
limited by a number of factors. For example, the SSN Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders following the
occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by the SSN Issuer’s then existing financial resources.
Under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the occurrence of a change of control of the
Company would require the repayment of such debt, and under the Existing Indentures and the PIK
Indenture, the occurrence of a change of control of the Company would require the SSN Issuer to make an
offer to purchase the Existing Senior Secured Notes. As a result, there can be no assurance that sufficient
funds will be available when necessary to make the required repurchase of the Senior Secured Notes and the
PIK Notes. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under other indebtedness of
the Company or its Subsidiaries and require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under such agreements
may not constitute a Change of Control under the SSN Indenture. Certain indebtedness of the Company or
its Subsidiaries may prohibit the SSN Issuer from purchasing Senior Secured Notes in the event of a Change
of Control or provide that a Change of Control is a default or requires repurchase upon a Change of Control.
Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the SSN Issuer to purchase the Senior Secured
Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, other debt, even if the Change of Control itself
does not, due to the financial effect of the purchase on the SSN Issuer. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to
_the New Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to_
_finance an offer to repurchase the New Notes upon the occurrence of a change of control as required by the_
_Indenture and the change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection_
_in the event of certain important corporate events. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may have_
_the right to purchase all outstanding Notes in connection with a tender offer, even if certain holders do not consent_
_to the tender.”_

Subject to the limitations discussed below, the SSN Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain
transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a
Change of Control under the SSN Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding
at such time or otherwise affect the SSN Issuer’s capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on the SSN
Issuer’s ability to Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain


-----

_Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions_
in the SSN Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of
the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however,
the SSN Indenture does not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the
event of a highly leveraged transaction.

The Specified Change of Control Event feature is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers of the
Senior Secured Notes and the Issuer.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited
body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of such
phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to
whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a
Change of Control has occurred and the decision whether to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured
Notes as described above will in such circumstance be made in the good faith judgment of the SSN Issuer.

The provisions of the SSN Indenture relating to the SSN Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase
the Senior Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written
consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Company and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) if on the date of such Incurrence and after giving
_pro forma effect thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), the Consolidated Leverage_
Ratio for the Company is less than 6.0 to 1.0.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness:

(1) Indebtedness Incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to any Credit Facility
(including letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances issued or created under any Credit Facility), and

at any time outstanding not exceeding (i) the greater of (a) €570 million and (b) 100% of Consolidated

prohibited under the terms of the SSN Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Company owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however,
that:

not a SSN Guarantor or the SSN Issuer, it is unsecured and expressly subordinated in right of
payment to prior payment in full in cash (whether upon Stated Maturity, acceleration or otherwise)
and the performance in full of its obligations under the SSN Indenture to the extent required by the
Existing Intercreditor Agreement;

(d) (i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in any such


-----

Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary;
and (ii) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person other than the Company or
a Restricted Subsidiary, shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such
Indebtedness by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be;

(4) Indebtedness represented by (a) the Senior Secured Notes issued on the Original Issue Date and the SSN
Guarantees thereof, and the Existing Senior Secured Notes and related Guarantees, (b) Indebtedness

Restricted Subsidiary or another Restricted Subsidiary or is merged, consolidated, amalgamated or
otherwise combined with (including pursuant to any acquisition of assets and assumption of related
liabilities) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
Incurred to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate the transaction or series of
related transactions pursuant to which a Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was otherwise
acquired by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, with respect to each of clause
(5)(i) and (5)(ii), that at the time of such acquisition or other transaction (a) either the Company would
have been able to Incur €1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant
or the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of the Company would not be greater than it was immediately prior
to giving effect to such acquisition or other transaction, in either case after giving effect to the Incurrence
of such Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (5);

(6) Indebtedness under Currency Agreements, Interest Rate Agreements and Commodity Hedging
Agreements entered into for bona fide hedging purposes of the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries
and not for speculative purposes (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the SSN
Issuer or the Company or an Officer of the SSN Issuer or the Company);

(7) Indebtedness represented by Capitalized Lease Obligations or Purchase Money Obligations, and in each
case any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof, in an aggregate outstanding principal amount

the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice, (b) letters of credit, bankers’acceptances,
guarantees or other similar instruments or obligations issued or relating to liabilities or obligations
Incurred in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice; provided, however, that upon
the drawing of such letters of credit or similar instruments, the obligations are reimbursed within 30 days
following such drawing, (c) the financing of insurance premiums in the ordinary course of business or
consistent with past practice and (d) any customary cash management, cash pooling or netting or setting
off arrangements in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice;

(9) Indebtedness arising from agreements providing for customary guarantees, indemnification, obligations
in respect of earn outs or other adjustments of purchase price or, in each case, similar obligations, in each

Person acquiring or disposing of such business or assets or such Subsidiary for the purpose of financing
such acquisition or disposition); provided that the maximum liability of the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries in respect of all such Indebtedness shall at no time exceed the gross proceeds, including the
fair market value of non-cash proceeds (measured at the time received and without giving effect to any
subsequent changes in value), actually received by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in
connection with such disposition;


-----

(10)

(a) Indebtedness arising from the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a check, draft or

bad debt purposes, in each case incurred or undertaken in the ordinary course of business on arm’s
length commercial terms on a recourse basis;

(11) Indebtedness in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with any
Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and the aggregate principal amount of all other Indebtedness
Incurred pursuant to this clause (11) and then outstanding, will not exceed the greater of €86 million and
15% of Consolidated EBITDA;

however, that (i) any such Net Cash Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall be excluded for
purposes of making Restricted Payments (as defined herein) under the first paragraph and clauses (1),

_Restricted Payments” to the extent the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries incur Indebtedness in_
reliance thereon and (ii) any Net Cash Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall be excluded for
purposes of Incurring Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (12) to the extent the Company or any of its

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular

(1) subject to clause (2) below, in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types
of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the SSN Issuer, in its sole
discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be
required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the second
paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant;

(2) all Indebtedness under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement outstanding on the Original
Issue Date (after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions) shall be deemed to have been Incurred


-----

pursuant to clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant, and the SSN Issuer will not be permitted
to reclassify all or a portion of such Indebtedness Incurred on the Original Issue Date;

(3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination
of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred
pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (7), (11) or (14)
of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’acceptances
or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be
included;

(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred
Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or
repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation
preference thereof;

(6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision
permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or
more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(7) the amount of Indebtedness shall be calculated as described under the definition of “Indebtedness”;

(8) subject to clause (2) above, if at any time the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary would be entitled to
have Incurred any then outstanding item of Indebtedness originally incurred under clauses (1), (7), (11)
and (14) of the second paragraph of this covenant pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, such
item of Indebtedness shall be automatically reclassified into an item of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant
to the first paragraph of this covenant;

(9) for purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness Incurred under
a Credit Facility, re borrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to a “cash sweep” or “clean
down” provision or any similar provisions under a Credit Facility that provide that Indebtedness is
deemed to have been repaid periodically shall only be deemed for the purposes of this covenant to have
been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on the date of any subsequent re
borrowing thereof;

(10) in the event that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments under a
revolving credit facility, enters into any commitment to Incur or issue Indebtedness or commits to Incur
any Lien pursuant to clause (25) of the definition of “Permitted Liens,”the Incurrence or issuance thereof
for all purposes under the SSN Indenture, including without limitation for purposes of calculating the
Consolidated Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, or usage of clauses
(1) through (15) of the second paragraph of this covenant (if any) for borrowings and reborrowings
thereunder (and including issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’acceptances thereunder)
will, at the SSN Issuer’s option, either be determined (a) on the date of such revolving credit facility or
such entry into or increase in commitments (assuming that the full amount thereof has been borrowed as
of such date) or other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, and, if such Consolidated
Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, as applicable, test or other provision
of the SSN Indenture is satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any borrowing or reborrowing
thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will
be permitted under this covenant irrespective of the Consolidated Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated
Senior Secured Leverage Ratio or other provision of the SSN Indenture at the time of any borrowing or
reborrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the
committed amount permitted to be borrowed or reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters of
credit and bankers’ acceptances) on a date pursuant to the operation of this sub-clause (a) shall be the
“Reserved Indebtedness Amount” as of such date for purposes of the Consolidated Leverage Ratio or the
Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, as applicable, and, to the extent of the usage of
clauses (1) through (15) of the second paragraph of this covenant (if any), shall be deemed to be Incurred
and outstanding under such clauses) or (b) on the date such amount is borrowed pursuant to any such
facility or increased commitment, and in each case, the SSN Issuer may revoke such determination at any
time and from time to time; and

(11) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred to


-----

refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this covenant
measured by reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, if such
refinancing would cause the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated
based on the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of
Consolidated EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of
such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being
refinanced, plus premiums (including tender premiums), accrued and unpaid interest, defeasance, costs
and fees in connection with such refinancing.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of
dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of
commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS, will not be deemed to be an
Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date.

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another
currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such
Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or, at the option of the SSN Issuer, first
committed, in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that (a) if such
Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and
such refinancing would cause the applicable euro denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the
relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro denominated restriction
shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the aggregate principal amount of such Refinancing
Indebtedness does not exceed the aggregate principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus any
amount to pay premiums (including tender premiums), accrued and unpaid interest, expenses, defeasance
costs and fees in connection therewith; (b) the Euro Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of any such
Indebtedness outstanding on, in the case of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries, the Original Issue
Date, or in the case of the Vivacom Group, the Vivacom Acquisition Closing Date shall be calculated based
on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Original Issue Date or the Vivacom Acquisition Closing
Date, as applicable; and (c) if and for so long as any such Indebtedness is subject to a Currency Agreement
with respect to the currency in which such Indebtedness is denominated covering principal and interest on
such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness, if denominated in euro, will be the amount of the
principal payment required to be made under such Currency Agreement and, otherwise, the Euro Equivalent
of such amount plus the Euro Equivalent of any premium which is at such time due and payable but is not
covered by such Currency Agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded
solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness
Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being
refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such
Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

(a) a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (or would result immediately
thereafter therefrom);

(b) the Company is not able to Incur an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph
under the “—Limitation on Indebtedness” covenant after giving effect, on a pro forma basis, to such

Subsidiary subsequent to January 1, 2019 of any Indebtedness that has been converted into or
exchanged for Capital Stock of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated
Preference Shares) or Subordinated Shareholder Funding (plus the amount of any cash, and the fair
market value of property or assets or marketable securities, received by the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary upon such conversion or exchange);

(iv) the amount equal to the net reduction in Restricted Investments made by the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries resulting from:

(A) repurchases, redemptions or other acquisitions or retirements of any such Restricted
Investment, proceeds realized upon the sale or other disposition to a Person other than the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of any such Restricted Investment, repayments of loans
or advances or other transfers of assets (including by way of dividend, distribution, interest
payments or returns of capital) to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(B) the redesignation of Unrestricted Subsidiaries as Restricted Subsidiaries (valued, in each case,
as provided in the definition of “Investment”) not to exceed, in the case of any Unrestricted
Subsidiary, the amount of Investments previously made by the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary in such Unrestricted Subsidiary, which amount, in each case under this clause (iv),
was included in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments referred to in the first
sentence of this clause (c); provided, however, that no amount will be included in Consolidated
Net Income for purposes of the preceding clause (i) to the extent that it is (at the Company’s or
SSN Issuer’s option) included under this clause (iv); and

(v) the amount of the cash and the fair market value of property or assets or of marketable securities

Restricted Subsidiary) of Capital Stock of an Unrestricted Subsidiary of the Company; and

(B) any dividend or distribution made by an Unrestricted Subsidiary or Affiliate to the Company
or a Restricted Subsidiary;

_provided, however, that no amount will be included in Consolidated Net Income for purposes of the preceding_
clause (i) to the extent that it is (at the Company’s or SSN Issuer’s option) included under this clause (v);
_provided further, however, that such amount under this clause (v) shall not exceed the amount included in the_
calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments referred to in the first sentence of this clause (c).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amounts (such amounts, the “Excluded Amounts”) that would otherwise
be included in the calculation of the amount available for Restricted Payments pursuant to sub-clauses (ii) or
(iii) of the preceding clause (c) will be excluded to the extent (1) such amounts result from the receipt of Net
Cash Proceeds, property or assets or marketable securities received in contemplation of, or in connection
with, an event that would otherwise constitute a Change of Control pursuant to the definition thereof were it
not a Specified Change of Control Event, (2) the purpose of the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds, property
or assets or marketable securities was to reduce the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of the Company so that
there would be an occurrence of a Specified Change of Control Event that would not have been achieved
without the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds, property or assets or marketable securities and (3) no Change
of Control Offer is made in connection with such event in accordance with the requirements of the Indenture.

Upon the occurrence of any Specified Change of Control Event following the Original Issue Date, all amounts
calculated pursuant to clause (c) of the first paragraph of this covenant shall be reset to zero and all references
to January 1, 2019 in clause (c) of the first paragraph of this covenant shall thereafter refer to the date of such
Specified Change of Control Event.

(1) any purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement of Capital Stock,
Disqualified Stock, Designated Preference Shares, Subordinated Shareholder Funding or Subordinated
Indebtedness made by exchange for or out of the proceeds of the substantially concurrent sale of (other

value of property or assets or of marketable securities, from such sale of Capital Stock, Subordinated
Shareholder Funding or such contribution will be excluded from clause (c)(ii) of the first paragraph of
this covenant;

substantially concurrent sale of Preferred Stock of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case
may be, that, in each case, is not prohibited to be Incurred pursuant to the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Indebtedness” above, and that in each case, constitutes Refinancing Indebtedness;

from any future, present or former Management Investors of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or
any Parent Holding Company in connection with a repurchase of Capital Stock of the Company or any
Parent Holding Company will not be deemed to constitute a Restricted Payment for purposes of this covenant

for Dutch corporate income tax or value added tax purposes, up to an amount not to exceed with respect
to such Taxes, unless otherwise required by Dutch tax rules in respect of a fiscal unity, the amount of any
such Taxes that the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries would have been required to pay on a
separate company basis or on a consolidated basis if the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries had
paid tax on a consolidated, combined, group, affiliates or unitary basis on behalf of an affiliate group
consisting only of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries; provided that the remainder of any such
distribution to any Parent Holding Company not used for such Taxes shall be returned to the Company
or such Restricted Subsidiary.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of such
Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Company or
such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value of
any cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash Restricted
Payment shall be determined conclusively by the Board of Directors of the SSN Issuer or the Company or an
Officer of the SSN Issuer or the Company acting in good faith.


-----

For the purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a Restricted Payment (or
portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Payments described in
clauses (1) through (19) of the fourth paragraph of this covenant, or is permitted pursuant to the first
paragraph of this covenant and/or one or more of the clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted
_Investments,” the SSN Issuer will be entitled to classify such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion_
thereof) on the date of its payment or later reclassify (based on circumstances existing on the date of such
reclassification) such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) in any manner that complies
with this covenant, including as an Investment pursuant to one or more of the clauses contained in the
definition of “Permitted Investments.”

Unrestricted Subsidiaries may use value transferred from the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries in a
Permitted Investment to purchase or otherwise acquire Indebtedness or Capital Stock of the SSN Issuer, the
Company, any Parent Holding Company or any of the Company’s Restricted Subsidiaries, and to transfer
value to the holders of the Capital Stock or any Parent Holding Company and to Affiliates thereof, and such
purchase, acquisition, or transfer will not be deemed to be a “direct or indirect”action by the Company or the
Restricted Subsidiaries.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or
suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary),
whether owned on the Original Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any income or
profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except (a) in the
case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral, (1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property
or assets that are not Permitted Liens if the Senior Secured Notes and the SSN Indenture (or a SSN Guarantee
in the case of Liens of a SSN Guarantor) are secured equally and ratably with (or prior to, in the case of Liens
with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness) such Indebtedness for so long as such Indebtedness is so secured
(provided that a Lien to secure Indebtedness pursuant to clauses (1), (6) or (14) of the second paragraph of
the “—Limitation on Indebtedness” covenant may have priority with respect to the proceeds of any
enforcement of Collateral not materially less favorable to the Holders than that accorded to the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement pursuant to the Existing Intercreditor Agreement) and (b) in the case of
any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Senior Secured Notes pursuant to clause (a)(2) of the preceding
paragraph will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and
discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates and (ii) otherwise as set forth under “—Security—Release of
_Liens.”_

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of
the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of
such Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of
such Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization

funds utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such
Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Company or was merged, consolidated or
otherwise combined with or into the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary entered into or in connection
with such transaction) and outstanding on such date; provided that, for the purposes of this clause (2), if
another Person is the Successor Company, any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of such
Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed by the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary when such Person becomes the Successor Company;

(3) any (A) encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a refinancing of
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument referred to

amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this
paragraph or this clause (3); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to
such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less favorable in any
material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the

modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the SSN Issuer or the
Company or an Officer of the SSN Issuer or the Company) and (B) any encumbrance or restriction

reciprocal easement agreements of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capitalized Lease

all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary (or the property or assets
that are subject to such restriction) pending the closing of such sale or disposition;

(7) customary provisions in leases, licenses, joint venture agreements and other similar agreements and
instruments entered into in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice;

Holders than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Existing Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement and the Existing Intercreditor Agreement, together with the security documents associated
therewith as in effect on the Original Issue Date, (ii) in comparable financings (as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors of the SSN Issuer or the Company or an Officer of the SSN Issuer or the

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, make any Asset Disposition unless:

(1) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including by way
of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise)
at least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be determined on the date of contractually
agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the SSN
Issuer or the Company or an Officer of the SSN Issuer or the Company, of the shares and assets subject
to such Asset Disposition (including, for the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a Permitted
Asset Swap);

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the Asset
Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap), at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset Disposition
(excluding any consideration by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for,
any liabilities, contingent or otherwise, other than Indebtedness) received by the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash, Cash Equivalents or Temporary Cash
Investments; and

(3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied by the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be:

(a) to the extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (or is required by
the terms of any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary) (i) to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem
any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a SSN Guarantor (in each case, other than
Indebtedness owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary) or Indebtedness under the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility or any other Credit Facility or the Existing Indentures, the PIK
Indenture or the SSN Indenture (or any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof), plus accrued
and unpaid interest and any applicable redemption premium to the date of such prepayment,
repayment, purchase or redemption, within 365 days from the later of (A) the date of such Asset
Disposition and (B) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that, in connection
with any prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption of Indebtedness pursuant to this
clause (a), the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will cause
the related commitment (if any) (except in the case of any revolving Indebtedness including, but not
limited to, the revolving credit facility made available under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility


-----

Agreement) to be permanently reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid,
repaid, purchased or redeemed; (ii) to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Pari passu Indebtedness at
a price of no more than 100% of the principal amount of such Pari passu Indebtedness plus accrued
and unpaid interest and any applicable redemption premium to the date of such prepayment,
repayment, purchase or redemption; provided that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary shall
redeem, repay or repurchase Pari passu Indebtedness that is Public Debt pursuant to this clause
(ii) only if the SSN Issuer either (A) reduces the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured
Notes on an equal or ratable basis with any such Pari passu Indebtedness redeemed, repaid or
repurchased pursuant to this clause (ii) by, at its option, (x) redeeming Senior Secured Notes as
provided under “—Optional Redemption”and/or (y) purchasing Senior Secured Notes through open
market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions at market prices (which may be below par)
and/or (B) makes (at such time or subsequently in compliance with this covenant) an offer to the
Holders to purchase their Senior Secured Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth below
for an Asset Disposition Offer on an equal or ratable basis with any such Pari passu Indebtedness
redeemed, repaid or repurchased pursuant to this clause (ii) (which offer shall be deemed to be an
Asset Disposition Offer for purposes hereof); (iii) to purchase Senior Secured Notes through open
market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions at market prices (which may be below par);
(iv) to make (at such time or subsequently in compliance with this covenant) an offer to the Holders
to purchase their Senior Secured Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth below for an
Asset Disposition Offer (which offer shall be deemed to be an Asset Disposition Offer for purposes
hereof) or (v) to redeem Senior Secured Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption”; or

(b) to the extent the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or commit to invest in
Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a Restricted
Subsidiary with Net Available Cash received by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) within
365 days from the later of (i) the date of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net
Available Cash; provided, however, that any such investment in Additional Assets made pursuant to
a definitive binding agreement or a commitment approved by the Board of Directors of the SSN
Issuer or the Company or an Officer of the SSN Issuer or the Company that is executed or approved
within such time will satisfy this requirement, so long as such investment is consummated within
180 days of such 365th day; or

(c) to make a capital expenditure within 365 days from the later of (i) the date of such Asset Disposition
and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that any such capital expenditure
made pursuant to a definitive binding agreement or a commitment approved by the Board of
Directors of the SSN Issuer or the Company or an Officer of the SSN Issuer or the Company that
is executed or approved within such time will satisfy this requirement, so long as such capital
expenditure is consummated within 180 days of such 365th day; or

(d) any combination of the foregoing;

_provided that, (1) pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with clauses_
(a) through (d) above, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness or
otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the SSN Indenture and (2) the
Company (or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may elect to invest in Additional Assets prior to
receiving the Net Available Cash attributable to any given Asset Disposition (provided that such investment
shall be made no earlier than the earliest of notice to the Trustee of the relevant Asset Disposition, execution
of a definitive agreement for the relevant Asset Disposition or consummation of the relevant Asset
Disposition) and deem the amount so invested to be applied pursuant to and in accordance with clause
(b) above with respect to such Asset Disposition.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that (x) a contribution or distribution of any or all of the Net
Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by the Company or a Subsidiary to the SSN Issuer or to a Restricted
Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) is prohibited or delayed by applicable local
law (including financial assistance and corporate benefit restrictions and fiduciary and statutory duties of the
relevant directors), (y) a contribution or distribution of any or all of the Net Available Cash of any Asset
Disposition by the Company or a Subsidiary to the SSN Issuer or to a Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent
necessary to comply with this covenant) could result in material adverse Tax consequences, as determined by
the SSN Issuer in its sole discretion, or (z) a contribution or distribution of any or all of the Net Available
Cash of any Asset Disposition by the Company or a Subsidiary to the SSN Issuer or to a Restricted Subsidiary
(to the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) is subject to a contractual encumbrance or restriction
affecting the distribution and such encumbrance or restriction is not prohibited by the covenant described


-----

under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries,” the portion of such Net
Available Cash so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant.

Any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or committed to be applied or
invested as provided in clause (3) of the first paragraph of this covenant will be deemed to constitute “Excess
_Proceeds” under the SSN Indenture. On the 366th day after an Asset Disposition, or at such earlier date that_
the SSN Issuer elects, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds under the SSN Indenture exceeds
€30 million and has not been committed in accordance with clause (3)(b) of the first paragraph of this
covenant, the SSN Issuer will be required to make an offer (“Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders and, to
the extent the SSN Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari passu Indebtedness, to purchase the
maximum aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and any such Pari passu Indebtedness to
which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price
in respect of the Senior Secured Notes in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes and, in the case of any Pari passu Indebtedness, at an offer price of no more than 100% of the
principal amount of such Pari passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to,
but not including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the SSN Indenture or
the agreements governing such Pari passu Indebtedness, as applicable, and, in the case of the Senior Secured
Notes, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

To the extent that the aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and Pari passu Indebtedness so
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess
Proceeds, the SSN Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to
the other covenants contained in the SSN Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured
Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari passu Indebtedness surrendered
by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be
allocated among the Senior Secured Notes and Pari passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis on
the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Senior Secured Notes and Pari passu Indebtedness.
For the purposes of calculating the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in
euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such aggregate principal amounts into their
Euro Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the SSN Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer
Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds
shall be reset at zero. To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Senior
Secured Notes is denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the relevant Senior Secured
Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of such Senior Secured Notes shall not exceed
the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Senior Secured Notes are denominated that is actually
received by the SSN Issuer upon converting such portion into such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Senior Secured Notes, will remain open for a period
of not less than five Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No
later than five Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset
_Disposition Purchase Date”), the SSN Issuer will purchase (or procure the purchase of) the aggregate principal_
amount of Senior Secured Notes and, to the extent they elect, Pari passu Indebtedness required to be
purchased pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if less than the Asset
Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Senior Secured Notes and Pari passu Indebtedness
validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the SSN Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for
payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Senior Secured
Notes and Pari passu Indebtedness or portions of Senior Secured Notes and such Pari passu Indebtedness so
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset
Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Senior Secured Notes
and Pari passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and, in the case of the Senior
Secured Notes, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.
The SSN Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Senior Secured Notes or
portions thereof were accepted for payment by the SSN Issuer in accordance with the terms of this covenant.
The SSN Issuer or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five
Business Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering
Holder an amount equal to the purchase price of the Senior Secured Notes so validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the SSN Issuer for purchase, and the SSN Issuer will
promptly issue a new Senior Secured Note (or amend the Global Senior Secured Note), and the Trustee (or its
authenticating agent), upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from the SSN Issuer, will authenticate and


-----

mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) such new Senior Secured Note to such Holder, in an
aggregate principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Senior Secured Note surrendered;
provided that each such new Senior Secured Note will be in an aggregate principal amount with a minimum
denomination of €100,000. Any Senior Secured Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or
transferred by book-entry) by the SSN Issuer to the Holder thereof.

For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be cash:

(1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness or other liabilities (other than contingent liabilities) of
the Company (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company) or Indebtedness or other
liabilities (other than contingent liabilities) of a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated
Indebtedness of the SSN Issuer or a SSN Guarantor) and the release of the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary from the
transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash
Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition;

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such
Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Company and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released
from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the SSN Issuer (other than Subordinated Indebtedness)
received after the Original Issue Date from Persons who are not the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary; and

(5) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in such
Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated
Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed
the greater of €75 million and 2.0% of Total Assets (with the fair market value of each item of Designated
Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent
changes in value).

The SSN Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange
Act and any other securities laws or regulations (or rules of any exchange on which the Senior Secured Notes
are then listed) in connection with the repurchase of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to the SSN Indenture. To
the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with provisions
of this covenant, the SSN Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations (or exchange
rules) and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the SSN Indenture by virtue of any
conflict.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter
into or conduct any transaction (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the
rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Company (an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate
value in excess of €20 million unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Company
or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable
transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such
transaction in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of €30 million, the terms of
such transaction have been approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the SSN
Issuer or the Company.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Restricted Payments,” any Permitted Payments or any Permitted Investment;_

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, other equity related interests or other securities, or other payments,
awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or entering into, or

provided on behalf of officers, employees, directors or consultants approved by the Board of Directors
of the SSN Issuer or the Company, in each case in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past
practice or entered into in connection with or as a result of the Transactions, the United Group
Acquisition Transactions, the Tele2 Transactions, the 2019 OpCo Refinancing Transactions or the 2017
Refinancing Transactions and any transactions of a similar nature to the foregoing that occur after the
Original Issue Date;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(4) (a) any transaction between or among the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that
becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted
Subsidiaries and (b) any merger, amalgamation or consolidation with any Parent Holding Company;
_provided that such Parent Holding Company shall have no material liabilities and no material assets other_
than cash, Cash Equivalents and the Capital Stock of the Company and such merger, amalgamation or
consolidation is otherwise permitted under the SSN Indenture;

(5) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities (including
under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses provided on behalf of,
directors, officers, consultants or employees of the Company, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent
Holding Company (whether directly or indirectly and including through any Controlled Investment
Affiliate of such directors, officers or employees);

Refinancing Transactions and the 2017 Refinancing Transactions and any transactions of a similar
nature to the foregoing that occur after the Original Issue Date and the entry into and performance of
obligations of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries under the terms of any transaction
arising out of, and any payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument in
effect as of or on, in the case of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries, the Original Issue Date, or
in the case of the Vivacom Group, the Vivacom Acquisition Closing Date, as these agreements and
instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed or refinanced from time to
time in accordance with the other terms of this covenant or to the extent not more disadvantageous to
the Holders in any material respect and the entry into and performance of any registration rights or other

been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice between or among the

(19) any lease entered into between the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, as lessee, and any Affiliate of
the Company, as lessor, which is approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the
SSN Issuer or the Company;


-----

(20) intellectual property licenses in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice;

(21) payments to or from, and transactions with, any joint venture in the ordinary course of business or

**_Reports_**

For so long as any Senior Secured Notes are outstanding, the Company will provide to the Trustee the
following reports:

(1) within 120 days following the end of the fiscal year of the Company, annual reports containing, to the
extent applicable, the following information: (a) audited consolidated balance sheets of the Company as
of the end of the most recent two fiscal years and audited consolidated income statements and statements
of cash flow of the Company for the most recent two fiscal years, including customary footnotes to such
financial statements and the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements; (b) unaudited
_pro forma income statement information and balance sheet information of the Company (which, for the_
avoidance of doubt, shall not include the provision of a full income statement or balance sheet to the
extent not reasonably available), together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions,
dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed
fiscal year (other than the Vivacom Acquisition and the Tele2 Acquisition); (c) an operating and financial
review of the audited financial statements, including a discussion of the results of operations, financial
condition, and liquidity and capital resources of the Company, and a discussion of material commitments
and contingencies and critical accounting policies, with a similar scope to that included in the offering
memorandum; (d) description of the business, management and shareholders of the Company, all
material affiliate transactions and a description of all material contractual arrangements, including
material debt instruments; and (e) a description of material risk factors and material recent developments;

(2) within 60 days following the end of the first three fiscal quarters of the Company, quarterly reports of
the Company containing the following information: (a) an unaudited condensed consolidated balance
sheet of the Company as of the end of such quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and
cash flow of the Company for the most recent quarter year to date period ending on the unaudited
condensed balance sheet date, and the comparable prior-year period of the Company, together with
condensed footnote disclosure; (b) unaudited pro forma income statement information and balance sheet
information of the Company (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the provision of a full
income statement or balance sheet to the extent not reasonably available), together with explanatory
footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the
beginning of the relevant quarter (other than the Vivacom Acquisition and the Tele2 Acquisition); (c) an
operating and financial review of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of the results
of operations, financial condition, and material changes in liquidity and capital resources of the
Company, and a discussion of material changes not in the ordinary course of business in commitments
and contingencies since the most recent report; and (d) material recent developments; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of any material acquisition, disposition or restructuring or any senior
executive officer changes at the Company or change in auditors of the Company or any other material
event that the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries announces publicly, a report containing a
description of such event.

For the avoidance of doubt, any reports provided pursuant to clauses (1) or (2) above shall not be required to
include a presentation similar in scope to that included in the offering memorandum under “Reconciliation of
_Certain Financial Data Presented Herein.”_

All financial statement and pro forma financial information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in
effect on the date of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect)
and on a consistent basis for the periods presented; provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1),
(2) and (3) above may, in the event of a change in applicable IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that
applied to such periods. Except as provided for in this covenant, no report need include separate financial
statements for any Subsidiaries of the Company. The filing of an Annual Report on Form 20 F within the
time period specified in (1) will satisfy such provision. At the Company’s election it may include consolidated


-----

financial statements of a Parent Holding Company in lieu of those for the Company; provided that, if the
financial statements of a Parent Holding Company are included in such report, a reasonably detailed
description of material differences between the financial statements of the Parent Holding Company and the
Company shall be included for any period after the Original Issue Date. Following an Initial Public Offering
on the Capital Stock of the Company or any parent thereof and/or the listing of such Capital Stock on a
recognized stock exchange, the requirements of this covenant shall be considered to have been fulfilled if the
IPO Entity complies with the reporting requirements of such stock exchange.

At any time that any of the Company’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary, constitutes a Significant
Subsidiary of the Company, then the annual and quarterly financial information required by clauses (1) and
(2) of the first paragraph of this covenant shall include either (i) a reasonably detailed presentation, either on
the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of
operations of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results
of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Company or (ii) stand-alone audited or unaudited
financial statements, as the case may be, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary or Unrestricted Subsidiaries (as a
group or otherwise) together with an unaudited reconciliation to the financial information of the Company
and its Subsidiaries.

Substantially concurrently with the issuance to the Trustee of the reports or statement specified in clauses (1),
(2) and (3) of the first paragraph or in the third paragraph of this covenant, the Company shall also (a) use its
commercially reasonable efforts (i) to post copies of such reports or statement on such website as may be then
maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries or (ii) otherwise to provide substantially comparable
availability of such reports (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the SSN Issuer or the
Company or an Officer of the SSN Issuer or the Company) or (b) to the extent the Board of Directors of the
SSN Issuer or the Company or an Officer of the SSN Issuer or the Company determines in good faith that the
Company cannot make such reports or statement available in the manner described in the preceding clause
(a) owing to applicable law or after the use of the Company’s commercially reasonable efforts, furnish such
reports or statement to the Holders and, upon request, prospective purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes.
The Company will also make available copies of all reports required by clauses (1) through (3) of the first
paragraph of this covenant, if and for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the
Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules of the Authority so require.

In addition, so long as the Senior Secured Notes remain outstanding and during any period during which the
Company or the SSN Issuer is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom
pursuant to Rule 12g3 2(b), the Company shall furnish to the Holders and, upon their request, prospective
purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4)
under the Securities Act.

Delivery of any information, documents and reports to the Trustee pursuant to this section is for information
purposes and the Trustee’s receipt shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained
therein, including the SSN Issuer’s compliance with any of its covenants under the SSN Indenture.

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The SSN Issuer and the Company_

Neither the SSN Issuer nor the Company will consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or
lease all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to any Person, unless:

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Company”) will be a Person organized and
existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union or the United States of America,
any State of the United States or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada, Norway,
Switzerland or a Permissible Jurisdiction and the Successor Company (if not the SSN Issuer or the
Company, as the case may be) will expressly assume (in each case subject to any limitations contemplated
by the Agreed Security Principles) (a) by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee,
all the obligations of the SSN Issuer or the Company, as the case may be, under the Senior Secured Notes
or the SSN Guarantee and (b) all obligations of the SSN Issuer or the Company, as the case may be,
under the Security Documents (and, to the extent required by the Existing Intercreditor Agreement, the
Existing Intercreditor Agreement);

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an


-----

obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor Company as a result of such
transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such
transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) in the case of a transaction involving the Company, immediately after giving effect to such transaction,
either (a) the Successor Company would be able to Incur at least an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness
pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”or (b) the
Consolidated Leverage Ratio of the Successor Company would not be greater than the Consolidated
Leverage Ratio of the Company was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the SSN Issuer or the Company, as the case may be, shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer complies with the SSN Indenture and
that all conditions precedent in the SSN Indenture relating to such consolidation, merger or transfer have
been satisfied and that the SSN Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes, the Existing Intercreditor
Agreement and the Security Documents constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the SSN Issuer
or the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely
conclusively on such Officer’s Certificate without independent verification.

Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the SSN Issuer, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
(or that is deemed to be Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a
result of any such transaction undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing
Indebtedness with respect thereto, shall be deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the SSN Issuer or the Company,
as the case may be, which properties and assets, if held by the SSN Issuer or the Company instead of such
Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the SSN Issuer or the
Company on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties
and assets of the SSN Issuer or the Company, as the case may be.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of,
the SSN Issuer or the Company, as the case may be, under the SSN Indenture but in the case of a lease of all
or substantially all its assets, the predecessor company will not be released from its obligations under such
Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes.

Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2) and (3) and the provisions described below under “—Subsidiary
_SSN Guarantors”(which do not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence) and, other than with respect_
to the second preceding paragraph, clause (4) of the first paragraph of this covenant, (a) any Restricted
Subsidiary may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and
assets to the SSN Issuer or the Company, (b) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or otherwise combine
with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any other Restricted Subsidiary and
(c) the SSN Issuer, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may undertake the Transactions.
Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2), (3) and (4) (which do not apply to the transactions referred to in
this sentence), the SSN Issuer or the Company may consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge into an
Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the SSN Issuer or the
Company, reincorporating the SSN Issuer or the Company in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form
of the SSN Issuer or the Company.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant)
will not apply to the creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly,
in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would
involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

_Subsidiary SSN Guarantors_

No SSN Guarantor that is a Subsidiary of the SSN Issuer (a “Subsidiary SSN Guarantor”) may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person;

(2) convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to
any Person; or


-----

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into such SSN Guarantor,

unless:

(A) the other Person is the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a SSN Guarantor or becomes
a SSN Guarantor concurrently with the transaction; or

(B) (1) either (x) a SSN Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or transferee
Person expressly assumes (in each case subject to any limitations contemplated by the Agreed
Security Principles) all of the obligations of the SSN Guarantor under its SSN Guarantee and the
Security Documents (and, to the extent required by the Existing Intercreditor Agreement, the
Existing Intercreditor Agreement); and (2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no
Default has occurred and is continuing; or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger)
of the SSN Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the SSN
Guarantor (in each case other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted
by the SSN Indenture.

Notwithstanding the preceding clause (B) and the provisions described above under “—The SSN Issuer and
_the Company”(which does not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence), (a) any Restricted Subsidiary_
may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to a
Subsidiary SSN Guarantor, (b) any Subsidiary SSN Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine with,
merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any other Subsidiary SSN Guarantor and
(c) the Subsidiary SSN Guarantors may undertake the Transactions. Notwithstanding the preceding
clause (B)(2) (which does not apply to the transactions referred to in this sentence), a Subsidiary SSN
Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or organized
for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Subsidiary SSN Guarantor reincorporating the
Subsidiary SSN Guarantor in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the Subsidiary SSN
Guarantor.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly,
in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would
involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Original Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes have achieved Investment Grade
Status and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then,
beginning on that day and continuing until the Reversion Date, the provisions of the SSN Indenture
summarized under the following captions will not apply to such Senior Secured Notes: “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness,” “—Limitation on Restricted Payments,” “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from_
_Restricted Subsidiaries,” “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock,” “—Limitation on Affiliate_
_Transactions,” the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Merger_
_and Consolidation—The SSN Issuer and the Company,” and “—Limitation on Issuance of Guarantees of_
_Indebtedness,” and, in each case, any related default provision of the SSN Indenture will cease to be effective_
and will not be applicable to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first day
on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with
regard to actions of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary properly taken during the continuance of the
Suspension Event, and no action taken prior to the Reversion Date will constitute a Default or Event of
Default. The “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect
since the date of such Indenture except that no Default will be deemed to have occurred solely by reason of a
Restricted Payment made during the continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date, all
Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be classified, at the Company’s or
SSN Issuer’s option, as having been Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Indebtedness” or one of the clauses set forth in the second paragraph of such covenant (to
the extent such Indebtedness would be permitted to be Incurred thereunder as of the Reversion Date and
after giving effect to Indebtedness Incurred prior to the Suspension Event and outstanding on the Reversion
Date). To the extent such Indebtedness would not be so permitted to be incurred under the first two
paragraphs of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” such Indebtedness will be


-----

deemed to have been outstanding on the Original Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under
clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

Furthermore, (a) any transactions prohibited by the covenant described under “—Limitation on Affiliate
Transactions” entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during the
continuance of a Suspension Event shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (6) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions,”and (b) any encumbrance
or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action described in clauses (i) through
(iii) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distribution from
_Restricted Subsidiaries”that becomes effective during the continuance of a Suspension Event shall be deemed_
to be permitted pursuant to clause (1) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries.”_

In addition, the SSN Indenture also permits, without causing a Default or Event of Default, the Company or
any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any contractual commitments or take actions in the future after
any date on which the Senior Secured Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long as the
contractual commitments were entered into during the Suspension Event. The Trustee shall have no duty to
monitor the ratings of the Senior Secured Notes, shall not be deemed to have any knowledge of the ratings of
the Senior Secured Notes and shall have no duty to notify the Holders if the Senior Secured Notes achieve an
Investment Grade Status. The Company shall notify the Trustee that the conditions set forth in the first
paragraph under this caption has been satisfied; provided that no such notification shall be a condition for the
suspension of the covenants described under this caption to be effective. The Trustee shall not be obliged to
notify Holders of a Suspension Event or, if applicable, upon the occurrence of a Reversion Date.

There can be no assurance that the Senior Secured Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade
Status.

**_Limited Condition Acquisition, Irrevocable Repayment and Certain Compliance Calculations_**

In connection with any action being taken in connection with a Limited Condition Acquisition or Irrevocable
Repayment, for purposes of determining compliance with any provision of the SSN Indenture which requires
that no Default or Event of Default, as applicable, has occurred, is continuing or would result from any such
action, as applicable, such condition shall, at the option of the Company or the SSN Issuer, be deemed
satisfied, so long as no Default or Event of Default, as applicable, exists on the date the Definitive Agreements
for such Limited Condition Acquisition or Irrevocable Repayment is entered into after giving pro forma effect
to the applicable Limited Condition Acquisition or Irrevocable Repayment. For the avoidance of doubt, if
the Company or the SSN Issuer has exercised its option under the first sentence of this paragraph, and any
Default or Event of Default occurs following the date the Definitive Agreement for the applicable Limited
Condition Acquisition or Irrevocable Repayment was entered into and prior to the consummation of such
Limited Condition Acquisition or Irrevocable Repayment, any such Default or Event of Default shall be
deemed to not have occurred or be continuing for purposes of determining whether any action being taken in
connection with such Limited Condition Acquisition or Irrevocable Repayment is permitted hereunder.

In connection with any action being taken in connection with a Limited Condition Acquisition or Irrevocable
Repayment for purposes of:

(1) determining compliance with any provision of the SSN Indenture which requires the calculation of the
Consolidated Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio; or

(2) testing baskets set forth in the SSN Indenture,

in each case, at the option of the Company or the SSN Issuer (the Company’s or the SSN Issuer’s election to
exercise such option in connection with any Limited Condition Acquisition or Irrevocable Repayment, an
“LCA Election”), the date of determination of whether any such action is permitted hereunder, may be
deemed to be the date the Definitive Agreement for such Limited Condition Acquisition or Irrevocable
Repayment is entered into (the “LCA Test Date”). If, after giving pro forma effect to the Limited Condition
Acquisition or Irrevocable Repayment and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith
(including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) as if they had occurred at the
beginning of the Relevant Testing Period the Company could have taken such action on the relevant LCA
Test Date in compliance with such ratio or basket, such ratio or basket shall be deemed to have been complied
with.

If the Company or the SSN Issuer has made an LCA Election, then in connection with any subsequent
calculation of any ratio or basket availability with respect to the Incurrence of Indebtedness or Liens, or the


-----

making of Asset Dispositions, mergers, the conveyance, lease or other transfer of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Company or the designation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary on or following the relevant LCA
Test Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such Limited Condition Acquisition or Irrevocable
Repayment is consummated or the Definitive Agreement for such Limited Condition Acquisition or
Irrevocable Repayment is terminated or expires without consummation of such Limited Condition
Acquisition or Irrevocable Repayment, any such ratio or basket shall be calculated on a pro forma basis
assuming such Limited Condition Acquisition or Irrevocable Repayment and other transactions in connection
therewith (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) have been consummated.
If the Company or the SSN Issuer has made an LCA Election and any of the ratios or baskets for which
compliance was determined or tested as of the LCA Test Date are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in any
such ratio or basket, including due to fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA of the Company or the Person
subject to such Limited Condition Acquisition or Irrevocable Repayment, at or prior to the consummation of
the relevant transaction or action, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result
of such fluctuations.

If (x) any restriction, basket, threshold or permission is determined by reference to the greater of a fixed
amount (the “fixed component”) and a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets (in either case,
the “grower component”) and (y) the grower component of the applicable restriction, basket, threshold or
permission exceeds the applicable fixed component at any time, the fixed component shall be deemed to be
increased to the highest amount of the grower component reached from time to time and shall not
subsequently be reduced as a result of any decrease in the grower component.

If (x) a proposed action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) is incurred or entered into
pursuant to a fixed basket or the grower component of any other basket and (y) at a later time would
subsequently be permitted under a ratio based basket, unless otherwise elected by the Company, such action,
matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) shall automatically be reclassified to such ratio based
basket.

If any amount is incurred or utilized under any ratio based basket, such amount shall be permitted
notwithstanding any subsequent decline in the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured
Leverage Ratio or any other financial ratio or metric.

**_Limitation on Issuance of Guarantees of Indebtedness_**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this covenant, no Restricted Subsidiary that is not a SSN
Guarantor (other than the SSN Issuer) shall Guarantee any Indebtedness of the SSN Issuer, the Company or
a SSN Guarantor Incurred after (and not existing on, or provided for or required to be granted under written
agreements existing on), in the case of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries, the Original Issue Date
and, in the case of the Vivacom Group, the Vivacom Acquisition Closing Date, under any Credit Facility or
any Public Debt, unless such Restricted Subsidiary executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental
indenture substantially in the form attached to the SSN Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted
Subsidiary will provide a SSN Guarantee; provided, however, that such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be
obligated to Guarantee the Senior Secured Notes to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such SSN
Guarantee may reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in (a) any breach or violation of statutory
limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, capital
maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws, rules or regulations (or analogous restriction)
of any applicable jurisdiction; (b) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a
Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a
Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders or the partners of such partnership);
(c) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out of
pocket expenses; or (d) an inconsistency with the Agreed Security Principles or the Existing Intercreditor
Agreement. At the option of the Company or the SSN Issuer, any SSN Guarantee may contain limitations on
such guarantor’s liability to the extent reasonably necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available
to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial
assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights
of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

Future SSN Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released at the option of the Company or
the SSN Issuer if at the date of such release either (i) there is no Indebtedness of such guarantor outstanding
which was Incurred after the Original Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with
the SSN Indenture if such guarantor had not been designated as a guarantor or (ii) there is no Indebtedness
of such guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Original Issue Date and which could not have


-----

been Incurred in compliance with the SSN Indenture as at the date of such release if such guarantor were not
designated as a guarantor as at that date. The Trustee shall take all necessary actions to effectuate any release
of a SSN Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and
indemnifications.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or omit to take any action that
would have the result of materially impairing the security interest with respect to the Collateral (it being
understood that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens, or the confirmation or affirmation of security
interests in respect of the Collateral, shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the security
interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Company shall
not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for
the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents,
any Lien over any of the Collateral that is prohibited by the covenant entitled “—Limitation on Liens,”
_provided, that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur any Lien over any of the Collateral that_
is not prohibited by the covenant entitled “—Limitation on Liens,” including Permitted Collateral Liens and
the Collateral may be discharged, transferred or released in any circumstances not prohibited by the SSN
Indenture, the Existing Intercreditor Agreement or the applicable Security Documents.

Notwithstanding the above, nothing in this covenant shall restrict the discharge, transfer or release of any
Collateral or Lien in any circumstance in accordance with the SSN Indenture, the Existing Intercreditor
Agreement and the Security Documents. Subject to the foregoing, the Security Documents may be amended,
extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, replaced or otherwise modified or released (followed by an
immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets) (i) to cure any ambiguity,
omission, defect or inconsistency therein; (ii) for the purposes of Incurring Permitted Collateral Liens; (iii) to
add to the Collateral; (iv) to make any other change thereto that does not adversely affect the Holders in any
material respect or (v) to amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, replace or otherwise modify or release
(followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets) any Security
Documents for the purposes of undertaking a Permitted Reorganization and/or Permitted Tax Restructuring
or a transaction not prohibited by the covenant set forth under “—Merger and Consolidation”; provided,
_however, that in the case of clause (iv) and (v) above, no Security Document may be amended, extended,_
renewed, restated, supplemented, replaced or otherwise modified or released (followed by an immediate
retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), unless contemporaneously with such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, replacement or modification or release (followed
by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), the Company or the
SSN Issuer delivers to the Security Agent and the Trustee, either (1) a solvency opinion, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Security Agent and the Trustee, from an Independent Financial Advisor or
appraiser or investment bank of international standing which confirms the solvency of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension,
renewal, restatement, supplement, replacement, modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking
of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), (2) a certificate from the chief financial officer
or the Board of Directors of the relevant Person which confirms the solvency of the person granting any such
Lien after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, replacement, modification or release, (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least
equivalent ranking over the same assets), or (3) an Opinion of Counsel (subject to any qualifications
customary for this type of Opinion of Counsel), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee,
confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, replacement, modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a lien of
at least equivalent ranking over the same asset), the Lien or Liens created under the Security Document, so
amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, replaced, modified or released (followed by an
immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets) are valid and perfected Liens
not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such
Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, replacement, modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien
of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets) and to which the new Indebtedness secured by the
Permitted Collateral Lien is not subject.

In the event that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries comply with the requirements of this covenant,
the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to
such actions without the need for instructions from the Holders.


-----

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the SSN Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Senior Secured Note when due
and payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Senior Secured Note issued
under the SSN Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required
repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure to comply for 30 days after written notice by the Trustee on behalf of the Holders or by the
Holders of 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes with any of the
Company’s or the SSN Issuer’s obligations under the covenants described under “—Change of Control”
above or under the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants” above (in each case, other than a
failure to purchase Senior Secured Notes which will constitute an Event of Default under clause
(2) above);

(4) failure by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply for 60 days after written notice by
the Trustee on behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of 30% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Senior Secured Notes with its other agreements contained in the SSN Indenture;

(5) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there
may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries) other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such
Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the Original Issue Date, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at Stated Maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately upon
the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its Stated Maturity (the “cross acceleration
_provision”),_

and, in each case, the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the aggregate
principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the
maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates the greater of €70 million and 12% of Consolidated
EBITDA;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the SSN Issuer, the Company, a
Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited
consolidated financial statements of the Company), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the
“bankruptcy provisions”);

(7) failure by the SSN Issuer, the Company, any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries
that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements of the Company), would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of the greater of
€70 million and 12% of Consolidated EBITDA (exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance
company has acknowledged liability for), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period
of 60 days after the judgment becomes final and due (the “judgment default provision”);

(8) any security interest under the Security Documents on any Collateral having a fair market value in excess
of the greater of €35 million and 6% of Consolidated EBITDA shall, at any time, cease to be in full force
and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Existing
Intercreditor Agreement and the SSN Indenture) for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all
obligations under the SSN Indenture or the release or amendment of any such security interest in
accordance with the terms of the SSN Indenture, the Existing Intercreditor Agreement or such Security
Document or any such security interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or
the SSN Issuer, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in writing that any such security
interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Default continues for ten days (the “security default
_provisions”); and_

(9) any SSN Guarantee of the Company or a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect
(other than in accordance with the terms of such SSN Guarantee or the SSN Indenture) or is declared


-----

invalid or unenforceable in a judicial proceeding or any SSN Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its
obligations under its SSN Guarantee and any such Default continues for ten days (the “guarantee
_provisions”)._

However, a default under clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default
until the Trustee or the Holders of 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured
Notes notify the SSN Issuer of the default and, with respect to clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7), the SSN Issuer does
not cure such default within the time specified in clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7), as applicable, of this paragraph
after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (6) above) occurs and is continuing,
the Trustee by notice to the SSN Issuer or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Senior Secured Notes by written notice to the SSN Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee
at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest,
including Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Senior Secured Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a
declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any,
will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes
because an Event of Default described in clause (5) under “Events of Default”has occurred and is continuing,
the declaration of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of
default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (5) shall be remedied or cured,
or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall
have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if
(1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes would not conflict with any judgment or
decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of
principal, premium or interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes that
became due solely because of the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes, have been cured or waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (6) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if
any, and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Senior Secured Notes
will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the
Trustee or any Holders.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes under the
SSN Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to
nonpayment of principal, premium or interest, or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Senior Secured Note
held by a non-consenting Holder, which may only be waived with the consent of Holders of not less than 90%
of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes) and rescind any such acceleration
with respect to such Senior Secured Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any
judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to
exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of the
SSN Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right
consequent thereon.

Subject to the provisions of the SSN Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default
occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under
the SSN Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the
Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability, fees or expense. Except
to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy
with respect to the SSN Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have
requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to it against any
loss, liability, fees or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and
the offer of security and/or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have
not given the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such
request within such 60 day period.


-----

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Senior Secured Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding
for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The
Indenture provides that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing of which a
responsible officer of the Trustee has written notice, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers
to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee,
however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the SSN Indenture or that the Trustee
determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal
liability. Prior to taking any action under the SSN Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to security and/or
indemnification satisfactory to it against all losses, liabilities, fees and expenses caused or incurred by taking
or not taking such action.

The Indenture provides that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such
occurrence by the SSN Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after
being notified by the SSN Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium,
if any, or interest on any Senior Secured Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee
in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The SSN Issuer is required
to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating
whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The SSN Issuer is
required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of
which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the SSN Issuer is
taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

The Indenture provides for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but
only if the Trustee is secured and/or indemnified to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to
take certain actions in relation to the Senior Secured Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee
will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of security or indemnification to it, and it will be
for Holders to take action directly.

Holders may not enforce the SSN Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes except as provided in the SSN
Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and
the Existing Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture provides that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required
certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”), then at the time such Initial Default is
cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another
default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and
(ii) if any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant
entitled “—Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any
other provision of the SSN Indenture, such Default or Event of Default, shall be deemed to be cured upon the
delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though
such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the SSN Indenture.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Note Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified
with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then
outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer
for, such Senior Secured Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any
provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount
of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of,
or tender offer or exchange offer for, such Senior Secured Notes). If any amendment, supplement or waiver
will only affect the Senior Secured Notes of the series offered hereby, the 2026 SSNs, the 2026 FRNs, the 2027
SSNs or the 2028 SSNs or another series of senior secured notes issued under the SSN Indenture, only the
holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes, 2026
SSNs, 2026 FRNs, 2027 SSNs or 2028 SSNs (and not the consent of the holders of the majority of all senior
secured notes issued under the SSN Indenture), as the case may be, shall be required.

However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% of the then outstanding aggregate
principal amount of Senior Secured Notes affected (provided, however, that if any amendment, supplement,
waiver or other modification or consent will only affect the Senior Secured Notes of the series offered hereby,
the 2026 SSNs, the 2026 FRNs, the 2027 SSNs, the 2028 SSNs or another series of senior secured notes issued


-----

under the SSN Indenture, only the consent of the holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of
the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes, 2026 SSNs, 2026 FRNs, 2027 SSNs or 2028 SSNs, as the case may
be, shall be required), an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Senior Secured Notes held by a
non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes whose Holders must consent to an
amendment, supplement, waiver or modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Senior Secured
Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Senior Secured Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Senior Secured Note or change the time at
which any such Senior Secured Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above under “—Optional
_Redemption”;_

(5) make any such Senior Secured Note payable in currency other than that stated in such Senior Secured
Note;

(6) impair the contractual right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of
principal or interest on or with respect to such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes on or after the due dates
thereof;

(7) make any change in the provision of the SSN Indenture described under “—Withholding Taxes” that
adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Senior Secured Notes in any material respect or amends
the terms of such Senior Secured Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of
the Taxes described thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so
described thereunder unless the Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(8) release (i) any security interest granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral or (ii) any SSN
Guarantee, in each case, other than pursuant to the terms of the Security Document, the SSN Indenture
or the Existing Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable;

(9) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest
(except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes by the Holders of at least a
majority in aggregate principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes and a waiver of the payment
default that resulted from such acceleration); or

(10) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent described in
this sentence.

For the avoidance of doubt, the SSN Indenture shall not include any provision incorporating, giving effect to,
or otherwise reflecting the provisions of Section 316(b) of the Trust Indenture Act.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the SSN Issuer, the Trustee, the Security
Agent and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Note Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency, conform any provision to this “Description
_of the New Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of the New Notes” was intended_
to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the relevant Senior Secured Note Document or reduce the
minimum denomination of the Senior Secured Notes;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the SSN Issuer, the Company or
any SSN Guarantor under any Senior Secured Note Document;

(3) provide for uncertificated Senior Secured Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Senior Secured
Notes;

(4) add to the covenants for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any right or power conferred upon the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder in any material respect;

(6) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the SSN


-----

Issuer or the Company or an Officer of the SSN Issuer or the Company) for the issuance of Additional
Senior Secured Notes;

(7) add Guarantees with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, add security to or for the benefit of the Senior
Secured Notes, or confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any SSN
Guarantee or Lien (including the Collateral and the Security Documents) with respect to or securing the
Senior Secured Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking is provided for under the
SSN Indenture, the Existing Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents;

(8) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the SSN Indenture of a successor
Trustee or Security Agent pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the
Trustee or Security Agent to any Senior Secured Note Document;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, (i) to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in
favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders, in any property which is required by the
Security Documents to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required
to be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a security interest for the benefit
of any Person; provided that the granting of such security interest is not prohibited by the SSN Indenture
and the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” is complied
with or (ii) as otherwise provided in “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest”; or

(10) facilitate any transaction that complies with the covenants described under the headings “—Certain
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and_
_Subsidiary Stock” relating to mergers, consolidations and sales of assets._

In formulating its decisions on such matters, the Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled
to receive and rely on such evidence as it deems appropriate including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of
Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the SSN Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment of any Note Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the
proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the SSN Indenture by any Holder given
in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes (or a series thereof) will not be rendered
invalid by such tender. The Indenture does not contain a covenant regulating the offer or payment of a consent
fee to Holders.

**Acts by Holders**

A Senior Secured Note does not cease to be outstanding because the SSN Issuer, the Company, an Affiliate of
the Company, or any fund or other entity controlled, managed or advised by any direct or indirect shareholder
of the Company (or, in each case, any successor thereof) holds the Senior Secured Note; provided that in
determining whether the holders of the requisite majority of outstanding Senior Secured Notes have given
any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver hereunder, Senior Secured Notes
owned by the SSN Issuer, the Company, an Affiliate of the Company, or any fund or other entity controlled,
managed by or advised by any direct or indirect shareholder of the Company (or, in each case, any successor
thereof) shall be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding if a responsible officer of the Trustee has
received written notice of such ownership at least two Business Days prior to the date of such determination.
Prior to the receipt of such notice, the Trustee shall be entitled to assume that none of the Senior Secured
Notes are owned by the SSN Issuer, the Company, an Affiliate of the Company, or any fund or other entity
controlled, managed by or advised by any direct or indirect shareholder of the Company (or, in each case, any
successor thereof). For the avoidance of doubt, provision of such notice shall not be an obligation of the
Company or the SSN Issuer.

**Defeasance**

The SSN Issuer at any time may terminate all its and each SSN Guarantor’s obligations under the Senior
Secured Notes and the SSN Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of
Default, except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers,
trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the SSN Issuer in connection
therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary Senior Secured Notes, registration of Senior Secured
Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Secured Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency
for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the SSN Issuer


-----

exercises its legal defeasance option, the Security Documents in effect at such time will terminate (other than
with respect to the defeasance trust).

The SSN Issuer at any time may terminate all its and each SSN Guarantor’s obligations under the covenants
described under “—Certain Covenants” (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The SSN Issuer and the Company” and
clauses (A), (B) and (C) of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—
_Subsidiary SSN Guarantors”) and “—Change of Control” and default provisions relating to such covenants_
described under “—Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross default upon a payment default, the
cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to the Company, the SSN Issuer and its
Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision, the guarantee provision and the security default
provision described under “—Events of Default” above (“covenant defeasance”).

The SSN Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior
exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the SSN Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of
the Senior Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to such Senior
Secured Notes. If the SSN Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Senior Secured
Notes, payment of such Senior Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified
in clause (3) (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The SSN Issuer and the Company” and clauses (A), (B) and (C) of_
the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—Subsidiary SSN
_Guarantors”), (4), (5), (6) (other than with respect to the SSN Issuer), (7), (8) or (9) under “—Events of_
_Default” above._

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the SSN Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance
_trust”) with the Trustee (or such entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for this purpose)_
cash in euros or euro denominated European Government Obligations or a combination thereof for the
payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Senior Secured Notes to redemption or maturity,
as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, to the effect that holders will
not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and
defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner
and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and
in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel must be based on a ruling received from, or
published by, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law
since the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the SSN Issuer with the intent of
defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the SSN Issuer; and

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating
to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Security Documents will be discharged
and cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the
Senior Secured Notes, as expressly provided for in the SSN Indenture) as to all outstanding Senior Secured
Notes when (1) either (a) all the Senior Secured Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than
certain lost, stolen or destroyed Senior Secured Notes and certain Senior Secured Notes for which provision
for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the SSN Issuer) have been
delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation; or (b) all Senior Secured Notes not previously delivered to the
Paying Agent for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their
Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements
satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the
expense, of the SSN Issuer; (2) the SSN Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or
such entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for this purpose), euros or euro denominated
European Government Obligations or a combination thereof, as applicable in an amount sufficient to pay
and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Senior Secured Notes not previously delivered to the Paying
Agent for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Senior


-----

Secured Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case
may be; (3) the SSN Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the SSN Indenture;
(4) the SSN Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to both the Paying Agent and the Trustee under the
SSN Indenture to apply the deposited money towards payment of the Senior Secured Notes at maturity or on
the redemption date, as the case may be; and (5) the SSN Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each to the effect that all conditions precedent under the
“—Satisfaction and Discharge” section of the SSN Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the
SSN Indenture have been complied with, provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate
as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)). If requested in
writing by the SSN Issuer, the Trustee may distribute any amounts deposited to the Holders prior to Stated
Maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be; provided, however, that the Holders shall have received at
least three Business Days’ notice from the SSN Issuer of such earlier repayment date (which may be included
in the notice of redemption). For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to Holders prior to
Stated Maturity or redemption date as set forth above will not include any negative interest, present value
adjustment, break costs or any other premium on such amounts.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees, Incorporators and Shareholders**

No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or its or their Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries under the Note Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of,
such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Senior Secured Note waives and releases all
such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Senior Secured Notes.
Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of
the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee, the Security Agent and Certain Agents**

U.S. Bank Trustees Limited has been appointed as Trustee under the SSN Indenture. The Indenture provides
that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has
written notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in such Indenture. During
the existence of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has written notice, the
Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the SSN Indenture and use the same
degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the
Trustee and the Security Agent to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the SSN Indenture
will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Indenture sets out the terms under which the Trustee or the Security Agent may retire or be removed, and
replaced. Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee or the Security Agent may be removed at
any time by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes, or
may resign at any time by giving written notice to the SSN Issuer and (2) that if the Trustee or the Security
Agent at any time (a) has or acquires actual knowledge of a conflict of interest that is not eliminated or
(b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or acting as Security Agent or becomes insolvent or bankrupt,
then the SSN Issuer may remove the Trustee or the Security Agent, or any Holder who has been a bona fide
Holder for not less than six months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee or the Security Agent
and appointment of a successor Trustee or a successor Security Agent.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by
the successor Trustee.

The Indenture contains provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee or the Security Agent for any loss,
liability, taxes and expenses incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising
out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the SSN Indenture. Each of the Trustee and
the Security Agent shall be entitled to rely solely and conclusively on any Officer’s Certificate or Opinion of
Counsel, as applicable, in formulating its opinion or in taking any action (including, without limitation, release
of a SSN Guarantee or Collateral) under the SSN Indenture, and may rely on such Officer’s Certificate or
Opinion of Counsel, as applicable, without need for investigation or verification, except as may otherwise be
provided for under the terms of the SSN Indenture.

The Trustee, the Security Agent, any Paying Agent and all other such agents are permitted to engage in other
transactions with the Company and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries. If the Trustee, the Security Agent or any


-----

other agent becomes the Holder, beneficial owner or pledgee of any Senior Secured Notes, it may deal with
the SSN Issuer with the same rights it would have if it were not the Trustee, the Security Agent, any Paying
Agent or any other such agent.

**Notices**

Any notice or communication sent to a Holder of Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes shall be in
writing and shall be validly given if mailed or delivered by (i) first class mail, postage prepaid, (ii) by hand
delivery to the Holder at the Holder’s address or (iii) electronically delivered, in each case as it appears on the
registration books of the Registrar, with a copy to the Trustee. At the SSN Issuer’s request, the Paying Agent
or the Registrar shall mail or deliver such notices or communications to each Holder of Definitive Registered
Senior Secured Notes in the SSN Issuer’s name and at the SSN Issuer’s expense. For so long as any Senior
Secured Notes are represented by Global Senior Secured Notes, all notices to Holders will be delivered to
Euroclear and Clearstream in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream,
delivery of which shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph, which will give such notices to
the holders of Book-entry Interests.

In addition, for so long as any of the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and
if and for so long as the rules of Authority shall so require, the SSN Issuer will notify the Authority of any
notice with respect to the Senior Secured Notes.

Each notice or communication shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if
published more than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if
notices are mailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the
seventh day after being so mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder of Definitive Registered
Senior Secured Notes shall be mailed to such Person by first class mail or other equivalent means and shall be
sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed. If a notice or communication is given
via Euroclear or Clearstream, it will be deemed to have been duly given on the day the notice is given to
Euroclear or Clearstream.

If a notice or communication is provided in the manner provided in the preceding three paragraphs, as
applicable, it is duly given, whether or not a Holder or holder of a beneficial interest in the Senior Secured
Notes receives it. Failure to send a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its
sufficiency with respect to other Holders.

**Prescription**

Claims against the SSN Issuer or any SSN Guarantor for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the
Senior Secured Notes will be prescribed five years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims
against the SSN Issuer or any SSN Guarantor for the payment of interest on the Senior Secured Notes will be
prescribed three years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro Denominated Restrictions**

The euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the SSN Issuer and the SSN
Guarantors under or in connection with the Senior Secured Notes and the SSN Guarantees, as the case may
be, including damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than euro, whether as a result
of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding up or dissolution
of the SSN Issuer, any SSN Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum
expressed to be due to it from the SSN Issuer or a SSN Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the SSN
Issuer or such SSN Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the euro amount which the recipient is able to
purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or
recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is
practicable to do so).

If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under any
Senior Secured Note, the SSN Issuer and the SSN Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained
by such recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the SSN Issuer and the SSN Guarantors will
indemnify the recipient or the Trustee on a joint and several basis against the cost of making any such
purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter
stated therein for the Holder or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the SSN Issuer
(indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These


-----

indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the SSN Issuer’s and the SSN Guarantors’
other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any
waiver granted by any Holder or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will
continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in
respect of any sum due under any Senior Secured Note, any SSN Guarantee or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any euro
denominated restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a
non-euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such
non-euro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Listing**

Application will be made to list the Senior Secured Notes on the Official List of the Exchange and for
permission to be granted to deal in the Senior Secured Notes on the Exchange. There can be no assurance that
the application to list the Senior Secured Notes on the Official List of the Exchange will be approved or that
permission to deal in the Senior Secured Notes thereon will be granted, and settlement of the Senior Secured
Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing or permission.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since substantially all of the assets of the SSN Issuer and the SSN Guarantors are located outside the United
States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the SSN Issuer or any SSN Guarantor, including
judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, if any, interest, Additional Amounts, if any,
and any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Senior Secured Notes or the SSN
Guarantees, may not be collectable within the United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the SSN Indenture, the
Senior Secured Notes and the SSN Guarantees, the SSN Issuer and each SSN Guarantor will in the SSN
Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan
in the City of New York, County and State of New York, United States. The Indenture provides that the SSN
Issuer and each SSN Guarantor will appoint Corporation Service Company as its agent for service of process
in any suit, action or proceeding with respect to the SSN Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes brought in
the federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State of
New York, United States.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes and the SSN Guarantees, and the rights and duties of the parties
thereunder, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. For the
avoidance of doubt, the governing law of the SSN Indenture (including the SSN Guarantees) and the Senior
Secured Notes may be amended with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the
Senior Secured Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or

(other than with respect to clause (c)(i) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain

profits or capital (including without limitation withholding taxes), trade taxes and franchise taxes of any
Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries whether or not paid, estimated, accrued or required to be remitted to
any Governmental Authority.

“Consolidated Interest Expense” means, for any period (in each case, determined on the basis of IFRS), the

(7) the consolidated interest expense that was capitalized during such period; and

(8) interest actually paid by such Person or any Restricted Subsidiary under any Guarantee of Indebtedness
or other obligation of any other Person.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the purposes of the definition of Consolidated Interest Expense in
clause (c)(i) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments,” Consolidated Interest Expense shall not include (a) any interest accrued, capitalized or_
paid in respect of Subordinated Shareholder Funding, (b) any commissions, discounts, yield and other fees
and charges related to Receivables Financings, (c) any interest component of, or payments on, any operating

“Consolidated Leverage” means the sum of (x) the aggregate outstanding Indebtedness of a Person and its
Restricted Subsidiaries (excluding Hedging Obligations except to the extent provided in clause (c) of the
penultimate paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”)
and (y) the Reserved Indebtedness Amount of such Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries that upon its
Incurrence would constitute Indebtedness, less the cash and Cash Equivalents of such Person and its
Restricted Subsidiaries, as of the date of determination.

“Consolidated Leverage Ratio”means, as of any date of determination, the ratio of (x) Consolidated Leverage
of the relevant Person at such date to (y) Consolidated EBITDA; provided, however, that for the purposes of
calculating Consolidated EBITDA for the Relevant Testing Period, if, as of such date of determination:

(1) since the beginning of such period, such Person or any Restricted Subsidiary has disposed of any
company, any business, or any group of assets constituting an operating unit of a business (any such
disposition, a “Sale”) or if the transaction giving rise to the need to calculate the Consolidated Leverage
Ratio is such a Sale, Consolidated EBITDA for such period will be reduced by an amount equal to the
Consolidated EBITDA (if positive) attributable to the assets which are the subject of such Sale for such
period or increased by an amount equal to the Consolidated EBITDA (if negative) attributable thereto


-----

for such period; provided that if any such sale constitutes “discontinued operations” in accordance with
IFRS, Consolidated Net Income shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Consolidated Net Income
(if positive) attributable to such operations for such period or increased by an amount equal to the
Consolidated Net Income (if negative) attributable thereto for such period;

(2) since the beginning of such period, such Person or any Restricted Subsidiary (by merger or otherwise)
has made an Investment in any Person that thereby becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, or otherwise has
acquired any company, any business, or any group of assets constituting an operating unit of a business
(any such Investment or acquisition, a “Purchase”), including any such Purchase occurring in connection
with a transaction causing a calculation to be made hereunder, Consolidated EBITDA for such period
will be calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto, including anticipated synergies and cost savings as
if such Purchase occurred on the first day of such period;

(3) since the beginning of such period, any Person (that became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged or
otherwise combined with or into such Person or any Restricted Subsidiary since the beginning of such
period) will have made any Sale or any Purchase that would have required an adjustment pursuant to
clause (1) or (2) above if made by such Person or a Restricted Subsidiary since the beginning of such
period, Consolidated EBITDA for such period will be calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto,
including anticipated synergies and cost savings, as if such Sale or Purchase occurred on the first day of
such period; and

(4) since the beginning of such period, a transfer of shares of, or other transaction has occurred or is
contractually committed with respect to, such Person or any Restricted Subsidiary, that constitutes an
event that is contemplated by the definition of “Specified Change of Control Event”(any such transaction,
a “Specified Change of Control Transaction”), and solely for the purpose of making the determination
pursuant to “Specified Change of Control Event,” Consolidated EBITDA for such period shall be
calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto (including anticipated synergies and expenses and cost
savings expected to be obtained from the Specified Change of Control Transaction) as if such Specified
Change of Control Transaction (including such synergies and expenses and cost savings) had occurred
on the first day of such period.

For the purposes of this definition and the definitions of Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated Leverage,
Consolidated Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Income Taxes,
Consolidated Interest Expense and Consolidated Net Income, (a) calculations will be as determined in good
faith by a responsible financial or chief accounting officer of such Person or the Company (including in
respect of cost savings and synergies) as though the full effect of synergies and cost savings were realized on
the first day of the Relevant Testing Period and shall also include the reasonably anticipated full run-rate cost
savings effect (as calculated in good faith by a responsible financial or chief accounting officer of such Person
or the Company) of cost savings programs that have been initiated by such Person or its Restricted Subsidiaries
as though such cost savings programs had been fully implemented on the first day of the Relevant Testing
Period, (b) in determining the amount of Indebtedness outstanding on any date of determination, pro forma
effect shall be given to any Incurrence, repayment, repurchase, defeasance or other acquisition, retirement or
discharge of Indebtedness or causing any Reserved Indebtedness Amount to be deemed to be Incurred during
the Relevant Testing Period as if such transaction had occurred on the first day of the Relevant Testing
Period, (c) pro forma effect shall be given to anticipated acquisitions which have become subject to Definitive
Agreements, (d) Indebtedness Incurred in reliance on the second paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” as of the date of determination shall be excluded, (e) the
discharge on the Determination Date of any Indebtedness to the extent that the discharge of such
Indebtedness results from proceeds Indebtedness Incurred in reliance on the second paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” shall not be given effect, (f) calculations
shall also include the reasonably anticipated full run-rate effect of carriage contracts that have been entered
into on or prior to the date of determination but which have not yet been fully reflected in the Relevant
Testing Period (as determined and calculated by a responsible financial or accounting officer of such Person
or the Company) as if entered into on the first day of the Relevant Testing Period and (g) interest on a lease
(including any Capitalized Lease Obligation) shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably
determined by such Person to be the rate of interest implicit in such lease in accordance with IFRS.

on a consolidated basis on the basis of IFRS; provided, however, that there will not be included in such

**BOOK-ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The New Notes sold to qualified institutional buyers (“QIBs”) in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities
Act will initially be represented by global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
“Rule 144A Global Notes”). The New Notes sold outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under
the Securities Act will initially be represented by global notes in registered form without interest coupons
attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Global
Notes”). The Global Notes will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common depositary and registered in
the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

The New Notes may only be offered or sold within the United States pursuant to an exemption from, or in a
transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

Ownership of interests in the respective Global Notes (the “Book-entry Interests”) will be limited to persons
that have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or persons who hold interests through such
participants. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their participants
through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositaries.
Except under the limited circumstances described below, Book-entry Interests will not be issued in definitive
certificated form.

Book-entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be done only through, records maintained in
the book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The Book-entry Interests in the
Global Notes will be issued only in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000. The laws
of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of
securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive certificated form (“Definitive Registered
Notes”). The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-entry Interests. In
addition, while the New Notes are in global form, holders of Book-entry Interests will not receive physical
delivery of the New Notes in certificated form and will not be considered the owners or “holders” of New
Notes for any purpose.

So long as the New Notes are held in global form, the common depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream
(or the common depositary’s nominee), will be considered the sole holders of the Global Notes for all purposes
under the Indenture governing the New Notes. In addition, participants must rely on the procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear, Clearstream
and the participants through which they own Book-entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise
any rights of holders of the New Notes under the Indenture.

None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar, nor any of their respective
agents will have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-entry
Interests.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, will distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the holders
of the Book-entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption
of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-entry
Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with
the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). We understand that, under the existing practices
of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the New Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear
and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments
to prevent fractions) or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate unless otherwise required by
law or applicable stock exchange or depositary requirements; provided, however, that no Book-entry Interest
of less than € 100,000 principal amount may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

We will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium,
if any, and interest) to the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent will, in turn, make such payments to the common
depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream, which will distribute such payments to participants
in accordance with their customary procedures. We will make payments of all such amounts without deduction
or withholding for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges


-----

of whatever nature, except as may be required by law and as described under “Description of the New Notes.”
If any such deduction or withholding is required to be made, then, to the extent described under “Description
_of the New Notes” above, we will pay additional amounts as may be necessary in order for the net amounts_
received by any holder of the Global Notes or owner of Book-entry Interests after such deduction or
withholding to equal the net amounts that such holder or owner would have otherwise received in respect of
such Global Note or Book-entry Interest, as the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. We
expect that standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to
owners of Book-entry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer, Trustee, Paying Agent, Transfer Agent, Registrar or any of their
respective agents will treat the registered holders of the applicable Global Note (i.e. the common depositary
for Euroclear or Clearstream or its nominee) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and
for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, Trustee, Paying Agent, Transfer Agent, Registrar or
any of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

- any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or
payments made on account of, a Book-entry Interest or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the
records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made
on account of, a Book-entry Interest, or Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant;

- payments made by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to payments made on account of a Book-entry Interest; or

- Euroclear, Clearstream, or any participant or indirect participant.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility
of such participants as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of subscribers registered in “stock
name.”

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global
Notes will be paid through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in euro.

**Action by Owners of Book-entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of
Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-entry Interests are credited
and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant
or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in
the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with Euroclear
and Clearstream rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder of Notes requires physical
delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes to persons in jurisdictions that
require physical delivery of securities or to pledge such Notes, such holder of Notes must transfer its interests
in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in
accordance with the procedures set out in the Indenture.

The Global Notes will have a legend to the effect set out under “Transfer Restrictions.” Book-entry Interests
in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements discussed
under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Book-entry Interests may only be transferred in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any
applicable jurisdiction.

Through the 40-day distribution compliance period, beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note may
be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the Rule 144A Global Note
denominated in the same currency only if such transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A and the transferor first
delivers to the Trustee a certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is
being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the
meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance
with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with all applicable


-----

securities laws of the states of the United States and other jurisdictions. After the expiration of the 40-day
period, beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in
the form of a beneficial interest in the Rule 144A New Note without compliance with these certification
requirements.

Any Book-entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of a Book-entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-entry Interest
in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-entry Interest in such other Global Note, and
accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to
Book-entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-entry Interest.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-entry Interests will receive Definitive Registered Notes:

- if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary
and a successor depositary is not appointed by us within 120 days; or

- if the owner of a Book-entry Interest requests such an exchange in writing delivered through either
Euroclear or Clearstream following an Event of Default under the Indenture, and enforcement action is
being taken in respect thereof under the Indenture.

In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may
transfer such Note by surrendering it to the Registrar or the Transfer Agent. In the event of a partial transfer
or a partial redemption of a holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one Definitive Registered
Note, a Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred and a new
Definitive Registered Note in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed will be issued
to the transferor or the holder, as applicable; provided that no Definitive Registered Note in a denomination
less than € 100,000 will be issued. We will bear the cost of preparing, printing, packaging and delivering the
Definitive Registered Notes.

We will not be required to register the transfer or exchange of Definitive Registered Notes for a period of 15
calendar days preceding (i) the record date for any payment of interest on the New Notes, (ii) any date fixed
for redemption of the New Notes or (iii) any date fixed for selection of the New Notes to be redeemed in part.
Also, we are not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Notes selected for redemption or which
the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a change of control offer or
asset disposition offer. In the event of the transfer of any Definitive Registered Note, the Trustee, the Transfer
Agent and the Registrar may require a holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and
transfer documents as described in the Indenture. We may require a holder to pay any taxes and fees required
by law and permitted by the Indenture and the New Notes.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Note has
been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Note is mutilated and is surrendered
to the Registrar or at the office of the Transfer Agent, we will issue and the Trustee (or an authentication
agent appointed by it) will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and our
requirements are met. The Issuer or the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive
Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both to protect themselves, the
Trustee or the Paying Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss
which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. The Issuer may charge for any
expenses incurred by us in replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to
become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by the Issuer, pursuant to the provisions of
the Indenture, the Issuer in its discretion, may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay,
redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-entry Interests in the Global Notes
only after the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certification (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such notes.
Please see “Transfer Restrictions.”

Payment of principal, any repurchase price, premium and interest on Definitive Registered Notes will be
payable at the office of the Issuer’s paying agent in London.


-----

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar
and their respective agents shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Note as the absolute owner
thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the New Notes
will be evidenced through registration from time to time at the registered office of the registrar, and such
registration is a means of evidencing title to the New Notes.

The Issuer will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the applicable series of Notes; however,
owners of the Book-entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and
operation of accounts in Euroclear and Clearstream.

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable. We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience
of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system
and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the
Registrar nor the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those operations or procedures.

We understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream hold
securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities
transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such
participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the
safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities.
Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants
are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and
certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as
banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a
Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest
to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take
actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The
laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form.
Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of
beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the
Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-entry System**

The New Notes represented by their respective Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of
the Exchange. Transfers of interests in the Global Notes representing the New Notes between participants in
Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective rules and
operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers
of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, they are
under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be
discontinued or modified at any time. None of us, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent or the
Registrar will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective
participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing
their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the New Notes will be made in euro. Book-entry Interests owned through Euroclear or
Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in registered
form. Book-entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream
holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in same
day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of
trading of any Book-entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure
that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

**Taxation in the Netherlands**

This section outlines the principal Dutch tax consequences of the acquisition, holding, settlement, redemption
and disposal of the New Notes. It does not present a comprehensive or complete description of all aspects of
Dutch tax law which could be relevant to a holder of Notes (a “Noteholder”). For Dutch tax purposes, a
Noteholder may include an individual or entity that does not hold the legal title of the New Notes, but to
whom or to which, the New Notes are, or income from the New Notes is, nevertheless attributed based either
on this individual or entity owning a beneficial interest in the New Notes or on specific statutory provisions.
These include statutory provisions attributing Notes to an individual who is, or who has directly or indirectly
inherited from a person who was, the settlor, grantor or similar originator of a trust, foundation or similar
entity that holds the New Notes.

This section is intended as general information only. Prospective Noteholders should consult their own tax
adviser regarding the tax consequences of any acquisition, holding or disposal of Notes.

This section is based on Dutch tax law as applied and interpreted by Dutch tax courts and as published and in
effect on the date of this offering memorandum, including the tax rates applicable on that date, without
prejudice to any amendments introduced at a later date and implemented with or without retroactive effect.

Any reference in this section made to Dutch taxes, Dutch tax or Dutch tax law should be construed as a
reference to any taxes of any nature levied by or on behalf of the Netherlands or any of its subdivisions or
taxing authorities or to the law governing such taxes, respectively. The Netherlands means the part of the
Kingdom of the Netherlands located in Europe.

This section does not describe any Dutch tax considerations or consequences that may be relevant where a
Noteholder:

(i) is an individual and the Noteholder’s income or capital gains derived from the New Notes are attributable
to employment activities, the income from which is taxable in the Netherlands;

(ii) has a substantial interest (aanmerkelijk belang) or a fictitious substantial interest (fictief aanmerkelijk
belang) in the Issuer within the meaning of chapter 4 of the Dutch Income Tax Act 2001 (Wet
_inkomstenbelasting 2001). Generally, a Noteholder has a substantial interest in the Issuer if the_
Noteholder, alone or—in the case of an individual—together with a partner for Dutch tax purposes, or
any relative by blood or by marriage in the ascending or descending line (including foster children) of the
Noteholder or the partner, owns or holds, or is deemed to own or hold, certain rights to shares, including
rights to directly or indirectly acquire shares, directly or indirectly representing 5% or more of the Issuer’s
issued capital as a whole or for any class of shares or profit participating certificates (winstbewijzen)
relating to 5% or more of the Issuer’s annual profits or 5% or more of the Issuer’s liquidation proceeds;

(iii) is an entity that, although it is in principle subject to Dutch corporate income tax under the Dutch
Corporate Income Tax Act 1969 (Wet op de vennootschapsbelasting 1969) (the “CITA”), is not subject to
Dutch corporate income tax or is fully or partly exempt from Dutch corporate income tax (such as a
qualifying pension fund as described in section 5 CITA and a tax exempt investment fund (vrijgestelde
_beleggingsinstelling) as described in Section 6a CITA);_

(iv) is an investment institution (beleggingsinstelling) as described in Section 28 CITA; or

(v) that is an entity which is a resident of Aruba, Curacao or St. Maarten and fully or partly conducts a
business through a permanent establishment (vaste inrichting) or a permanent representative (vaste
_vertegenwoordiger) in Bonaire, Sint Eustatius or Saba to which the New Notes are attributable._


-----

**_Withholding Tax_**

Any payments made under the Notes will not be subject to withholding or deduction for, or on account of,
any Dutch taxes, unless withholding Tax is imposed under the Dutch Withholding Tax Act 2021 (as described
below)

A Noteholder will not be subject to withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Dutch Taxes, unless
a Noteholder is a Related Entity and:

(i) is resident in a state that qualifies as a low taxed jurisdiction or a jurisdiction that is listed on the European
Union list of non-cooperative jurisdictions (“Listed Jurisdictions”); or

(ii) is resident in another state, but the interest under the Notes is allocated by the Noteholder to a permanent
establishment situated in one of the Listed Jurisdictions; or

(iii) is considered tax transparent under the laws of its residence state, not being one of the Listed
Jurisdictions, and is not able to make use of an applicable rebuttal scheme; or

(iv) holds the interest in the Issuer with the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, to avoid taxation due
on the interest received in respect of the Notes by another entity and holds the interest, or is deemed to
hold the interest, as part of an artificial arrangement or transaction (or a series of artificial arrangements
or composite of transactions).

If the conditions above are satisfied, interest, including original issue discount, under the Notes will be subject
to a Dutch withholding tax at a rate of 25%.

An entity is considered a Related Entity if:

(i) it has a Qualifying Interest in the Issuer;

(ii) the Issuer has a Qualifying Interest in the Noteholder; or

(iii) a third party has a Qualifying Interest in both the Issuer and the entity holding the Notes.

The term Qualifying Interest means a direct or indirectly held interest—either by an entity individually or
jointly if an entity is part of a collaborating group (samenwerkende groep)—that enables such entity or such
collaborating group to exercise a definite influence over another entities' decisions, such as the Issuer or the
Noteholder as the case may be, and allows it to determine the other entities' activities.

A jurisdiction is considered low taxed if it is designated as such in an annually updated ministerial decree of
the Dutch Ministry of Finance. At the date of this prospectus, the designated low taxed jurisdictions are the
American Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Anguilla, the Bahamas, Bahrain, Barbados, Bermuda, the British
Virgin Islands, Guernsey, Fiji, Guam, the Isle of Man, Jersey, the Cayman Islands, Palau, Panama, Samoa,
Seychelles, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkmenistan, the Turks and Caicos Islands, Vanuatu and the United Arab
Emirates.

**_Taxes on Income and Capital Gains_**

_Residents of the Netherlands_

The description of certain Dutch tax consequences in this paragraph is only intended for the following
Noteholders:

(i) individuals who are resident or deemed to be resident in the Netherlands (“Dutch Resident Individuals”);
and

(ii) entities or enterprises that are subject to the CITA and are resident or deemed to be resident in the
Netherlands (“Dutch Resident Corporate Entities”).

_Dutch Resident Individuals engaged or deemed to be engaged in an enterprise or in miscellaneous activities_

Dutch Resident Individuals engaged or deemed to be engaged in an enterprise or in miscellaneous activities
(resultaat uit overige werkzaamheden) are generally subject to income tax at statutory progressive rates with a
maximum of 49.50% on any benefits derived or deemed to be derived from the New Notes, including any
capital gains realized on any disposal of the New Notes, where those benefits are attributable to:


-----

(i) an enterprise from which a Dutch Resident Individual derives profits, whether as an entrepreneur
(ondernemer) or by being co-entitled (medegerechtigde) to the net worth of the enterprise other than as
an entrepreneur or shareholder; or

(ii) miscellaneous activities, including activities beyond the scope of active portfolio investment activities
(meer dan normaal vermogensbeheer).

_Dutch Resident Individuals not engaged or deemed to be engaged in an enterprise or in miscellaneous activities_

Generally, the New Notes held by a Dutch Resident Individual who is not engaged or deemed to be engaged
in an enterprise or in miscellaneous activities, or who is so engaged or deemed to be engaged but the New
Notes are not attributable to that enterprise or miscellaneous activities, will be subject to annual income tax
imposed on a fictitious yield on the New Notes under the regime for savings and investments (inkomen uit
_sparen en beleggen). Irrespective of the actual income or capital gains realized, the annual taxable benefit from_
a Dutch Resident Individual’s assets and liabilities taxed under this regime, including the New Notes, is set at
a percentage of the positive balance of the fair market value of those assets, including the New Notes, and the
fair market value of these liabilities.

(i) from 1.8978% over the first €50,000 of such positive balance;

(ii) to 4.5014% over any excess positive balance between €50,000.01 up to and including €950,000; and

(iii) to a maximum of 5.69% over any excess positive balance of € 950,000.01 or higher.

These percentages will be reassessed each year and the amounts under (i) to (iii) will be adjusted for inflation
each year. No taxation occurs if this positive balance does not exceed a certain threshold (heffingvrij vermogen).
The fair market value of assets, including the New Notes, and liabilities that are taxed under this regime is
measured once in each calendar year on January 1. For 2021, the tax rate under the regime for savings and
investments is a flat rate of 31%.

_Dutch Resident Corporate Entities_

Dutch Resident Corporate Entities are generally subject to corporate income tax at statutory rates up to 25%
on any benefits derived or deemed to be derived from the New Notes, including any capital gains realized on
their disposal.

_Non-Residents of the Netherlands_

The description of certain Dutch tax consequences in this paragraph is only intended for the following
Noteholders:

(i) individuals who are not resident and not deemed to be resident in the Netherlands (“Non-Dutch Resident
Individuals”); and

(ii) entities that are not resident and not deemed to be resident in the Netherlands (“Non-Dutch Resident
Corporate Entities”).

_Non-Dutch Resident Individuals_

A Non-Dutch Resident Individual will not be subject to any Dutch taxes on income or capital gains derived
from the purchase, ownership and disposal or transfer of the New Notes, other than withholding tax as
described above, unless:

(i) the Non-Dutch Resident Individual derives profits from an enterprise, whether as entrepreneur or
pursuant to a co-entitlement to the net worth of this enterprise other than as an entrepreneur or
shareholder, and this enterprise is fully or partly carried on through a permanent establishment (vaste
inrichting) or a permanent representative (vaste vertegenwoordiger) in the Netherlands, to which the
New Notes are attributable;

(ii) the Non-Dutch Resident Individual derives benefits from miscellaneous activities carried on in the
Netherlands in respect of the New Notes, including activities which are beyond the scope of active
portfolio investment activities; or

(iii) the Non-Dutch Resident Individual is entitled to a share—other than by way of securities—in the profits
of an enterprise, which is effectively managed in the Netherlands and to which the New Notes are
attributable.


-----

_Non-Dutch Resident Corporate Entities_

A Non-Dutch Resident Corporate Entity will not be subject to any Dutch taxes on income or capital gains
derived from the purchase, ownership and disposal or transfer of the New Notes, other than withholding tax
as described above, unless:

(i) the Non-Dutch Resident Corporate Entity derives profits from an enterprise, which is fully or partly
carried on through a permanent establishment or a permanent representative in the Netherlands to which
the New Notes are attributable; or

(ii) the Non-Dutch Resident Corporate Entity is entitled to a share—other than by way of securities—in the
profits of an enterprise or a co-entitlement to the net worth of an enterprise, which is effectively managed
in the Netherlands and to which the New Notes are attributable.

Under certain specific circumstances, Dutch taxation rights may be restricted for Non-Dutch Resident
Individuals and Non-Dutch Resident Corporate Entities pursuant to treaties for the avoidance of double
taxation.

**_Dutch Gift Tax or Inheritance Tax_**

No Dutch gift tax or inheritance tax is due in respect of any gift of the New Notes by, or inheritance of the
New Notes on the death of, a Noteholder, unless:

(i) the Noteholder is resident, or is deemed to be resident, in the Netherlands at the time of the gift or death
of the Noteholder;

(ii) the Noteholder dies within 180 days after the date of the gift of the New Notes and was, or was deemed
to be, resident in the Netherlands at the time of the Noteholder’s death but not at the time of the gift; or

(iii) the gift of the New Notes is made under a condition precedent and the Noteholder is resident, or is
deemed to be resident, in the Netherlands at the time the condition is fulfilled.

**_Other Taxes and Duties_**

No other Dutch taxes, including taxes of a documentary nature, such as capital tax, stamp or registration tax
or duty, are payable by the Company or by, or on behalf of, the Noteholder by reason only of the issue,
acquisition or transfer of the New Notes.

**_Residency_**

A Noteholder will not become a resident or deemed resident of the Netherlands by reason only of holding the
New Notes.

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

**_General_**

The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences to a U.S. Holder (as defined
below), except for the discussion under “—Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act,” in connection with the
purchase, ownership and disposition of New Notes acquired pursuant the Offering. This summary does not
purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects and deals only with New Notes that are held as
capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
“Code”) by a U.S. Holder (as defined below) who acquires the New Notes upon their original issuance
pursuant to the Offering at their “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of the New Notes
of a series is sold to investors for cash, not including sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or
organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers).

A “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of New Notes that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes any of
the following:

- an individual citizen or resident of the United States;

- a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the
District of Columbia;

- an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or


-----

- a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more
U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) has a valid election in
effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations (“Treasury Regulations”) to be treated as a U.S. person.

This summary is based upon the tax laws of the United States, including provisions of the Code, Treasury
Regulations, rulings and judicial decisions, published administrative positions of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service (the “IRS”) and other applicable authorities, all as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be
changed, perhaps retroactively, so as to result in United States federal income tax consequences different from
those summarized below. We have not sought and will not seek any ruling from the IRS with respect to the
statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary and there can be no assurance that
the IRS or a court will agree with our statements and conclusions or that a court would not sustain a challenge
by the IRS in the event of litigation. A different tax treatment of the purchase, ownership or disposition of
the New Notes from those discussed below could adversely affect the amount, timing and character of income,
gain or loss in respect of an investment in the New Notes.

This summary is general in nature and does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income tax or all tax
considerations that may be relevant to U.S. Holders in light of their particular circumstances, and it does not
address any state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences or any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal
income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws). In addition, it does not represent a detailed description of
the U.S. federal income tax consequences applicable to U.S. Holders that are subject to special treatment
under the U.S. federal income tax laws. For example, this summary does not address:

- tax consequences to holders who are dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities that elect to use
the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities, banks, financial institutions, individual
retirement and other tax-deferred accounts, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts,
S corporations, partnerships or other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes and
investors in such entities, tax-exempt entities or insurance companies;

- tax consequences to persons holding the New Notes as part of a hedging, integrated, constructive sale or
conversion transaction or a straddle;

- tax consequences to persons that have ceased to be U.S. citizens or permanent residents of the United
States or entities covered by the anti-inversion rules;

- tax consequences to U.S. Holders whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar;

- persons who actually or constructively own more than 10% of our stock (by vote or value);

- tax consequences of persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of gross income with respect
to the New Notes being taken into account on an applicable financial statement; or

- base erosion and anti-abuse tax under Section 59A of the Code, alternative minimum tax or Medicare
contribution tax consequences, if any.

If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the New
Notes, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner
and the activities of the partner and the partnership. U.S. Holders that are partnerships, or partners of a
partnership holding the New Notes, should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the
purchase, ownership and disposition of the New Notes.

U.S. Holders considering the purchase of New Notes should consult their own tax advisors concerning the
particular U.S. federal income tax consequences to them of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the
New Notes, as well as the consequences to them arising under other U.S. federal tax laws and the laws of any
other taxing jurisdiction. The following discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations is for
informational purposes only and is not a substitute for careful tax planning and advice. If you are considering
the purchase of New Notes, you should consult your own tax advisor concerning the particular U.S. federal
income tax consequences to you of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the New Notes, as well as the
consequences to you arising under any other tax laws, under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction or due
to changes in tax law.

**_Characterization of the New Notes_**

We may be required to pay additional amounts if certain taxes are withheld or deducted from payments on
the New Notes (as described under “Description of the New Notes—Withholding Taxes”) or make additional
payments in redemption of the New Notes in addition to their stated principal amount and accrued interest


-----

(as described under “Description of the New Notes—Optional Redemption of the New Notes,” “Description of
_the New Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the New Notes—Optional Redemption for Tax_
_Reasons”). Although the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the payments of such_
additional amounts or additional payments in redemption of the New Notes does not result in the New Notes
being treated as contingent payment debt instruments under the applicable Treasury Regulations. This
position will be based in part on our determination that, as of the Issue Date of the New Notes, the possibility
that additional amounts will have to be paid is a remote or incidental contingency within the meaning of the
applicable Treasury Regulations.

Our determination that the New Notes are not contingent payment debt instruments is binding on a U.S.
Holder, unless the U.S. Holder explicitly discloses to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) on its tax
return for the year during which such U.S. Holder acquires the New Notes that it is taking a different position.
However, our position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a contrary position to that described above,
a U.S. Holder may be required to accrue interest income on its New Notes based upon a comparable yield,
regardless of its method of accounting. The “comparable yield” is the yield at which we would issue a fixed
rate debt instrument with no contingent payments, but with terms and conditions otherwise similar to those
of the New Notes. In addition, any gain on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable
disposition of the New Notes generally would be recharacterized as ordinary income. Each U.S. Holder should
consult its own tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of the New Notes being treated as contingent
payment debt instruments. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the New Notes will not be treated
as contingent payment debt instruments.

**_Payments of Interest_**

We expect, and this discussion assumes, that the New Notes will not be considered as issued with original
issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The New Notes will be treated as issued without
OID if the difference between their principal amount and their issue price is less than the product of onefourth of one percent (0.25 percent) of their principal amount multiplied by the number of full years to their
maturity. In general, however, if the New Notes are issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a
U.S. Holder will be required to include OID in gross income, as ordinary income, under a “constant-yield
method”before the receipt of cash attributable to such income, regardless of the U.S. Holder’s regular method
of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, interest on a New Note generally will be taxable to a
U.S. Holder as ordinary income at the time it is paid or accrued in accordance with the U.S. Holder’s method
of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition to interest on the New Notes, which includes
any non-U.S. tax withheld from the interest payments received, a U.S. Holder will be required to include in
income any additional amounts paid in respect of any such tax withheld and without reduction for any
non-U.S. tax withheld from any such additional amounts. U.S. Holders may be entitled to deduct or credit
non-U.S. withholding tax, subject to certain limitations (including that the election to deduct or credit
non-U.S. taxes applies to all of the U.S. Holder’s applicable non-U.S. taxes for a particular tax year). Interest
income (including any additional amounts) generally will be considered foreign source income and, for
purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credits, generally will be considered passive category income. The rules
governing the foreign tax credit are complex. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding
the availability of the foreign tax credit under their particular circumstances.

Interest on the New Notes will be payable in euros. A U.S. Holder who uses the cash method of accounting for
U.S. federal income tax purposes will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of the euro
payment received, determined by translating the euros received at the spot rate on the date of receipt regardless
of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars. A cash basis U.S. Holder will not recognize
exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment, but such U.S. Holder may have exchange
gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the euros so received.

A U.S. Holder who uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes may determine
the amount of income recognized with respect to such interest in accordance with either of two methods.
Under the first method, the U.S. Holder will be required to include in income for each taxable year the U.S.
dollar value of the interest that has accrued during such year, determined by translating such interest at the
average rate of exchange for the period or periods during which such interest accrued or, in the case of an
accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. Holder, the part of the period within the taxable year.
Under the second method, the U.S. Holder may elect to translate interest income at the spot rate on:

- the last day of the accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years, the
exchange rate in effect on the last day of the part of the period within each taxable year); or


-----

- the date the interest payment is received if such date is within five business days of the end of the accrual
period.

If a U.S. Holder elects to use the second method, the election must be applied consistently to all debt
obligations the U.S. Holder holds from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS.
U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the advisability of making the above election.

Whether or not such election is made, upon receipt of an interest payment on a New Note (including, upon
the disposition of a New Note, the receipt of proceeds which include amounts attributable to accrued interest
previously included in income), U.S. Holders who use the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal
income tax purposes will recognize exchange gain or loss (taxable as U.S. source ordinary income or loss) in
an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of such payment (determined by
translating the euros received at the spot rate on the date of receipt) and the U.S. dollar value of the interest
income the U.S. Holder previously included in income with respect to such payment, regardless of whether
the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars. Such gain or loss generally will constitute U.S. source gain or
loss.

**_Sale, Exchange, Redemption, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of New Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a New Note, a U.S. Holder
generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized upon the sale,
exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition (less an amount equal to any accrued but unpaid
interest, which will be taxable as interest income as discussed above) and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis
in the New Note, in each case as determined in U.S. dollars.

A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a New Note generally will be its U.S. dollar cost for that New Note
decreased by the amount of any payments of principal previously made in respect of such Note. If a U.S.
Holder sells or otherwise disposes of the New Notes in exchange for currency other than U.S. dollars, the
amount realized generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the currency received. If the New Notes are traded
on an established securities market when the U.S. Holder sells or otherwise disposes of the New Notes, the
amount realized will be, in the case of cash basis and electing accrual basis U.S. Holders, determined using the
spot rate on the settlement date. An accrual basis U.S. Holder that does not elect to determine the amount
realized using the spot exchange rate on the settlement date will recognize foreign currency gain or loss equal
to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the amount received based on the spot exchange rates in
effect on the date of the sale or other disposition and the settlement date. A U.S. Holder will have a tax basis
in the currency received equal to the U.S. dollar value of the currency received at the spot rate on the settlement
date. Any foreign currency gain or loss realized on the settlement date or the subsequent sale or other
disposition of the non-U.S. currency received for a different dollar amount generally will be U.S.-source
ordinary income or loss, and will not be eligible for the reduced tax rate applicable to long-term capital gains.
If an accrual basis U.S. Holder makes the election previously described, it must be applied consistently to all
debt instruments from year to year and cannot be revoked without the consent of the IRS.

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, any gain or loss realized by a U.S. Holder from the sale,
exchange redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a New Note generally will be capital gain or
loss and will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder has held the New Note for more
than one year at the time of the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the
New Note. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. Holders (including individuals) generally are
eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Gain or loss
realized by U.S. Holders on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a New
Note generally will be treated as U.S. source gain or loss. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors
about how to account for proceeds received on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable
disposition of a New Note that are not paid in U.S. dollars.

Upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a New Note, a U.S. Holder
may recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to the principal amount of the New Note. Exchange gain or
loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss and generally will be U.S. source gain or loss. For these purposes,
the principal amount of the New Note is a U.S. Holder’s purchase price for the New Note calculated in euros
on the date of purchase, and the amount of exchange gain or loss recognized is equal to the difference between
(i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined on the date of the sale, exchange, redemption,
retirement or other taxable disposition of the New Note and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount
determined on the date the U.S. Holder purchased the New Note. In addition, upon the sale, exchange,
retirement or other taxable disposition of a New Note, an accrual basis U.S. Holder may recognize foreign


-----

currency exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued interest which will be
treated as discussed above under “—Payments of Interest.” The amount of exchange gain or loss realized on
the disposition of the New Note (with respect to both principal and accrued interest) will be limited to the
amount of overall gain or loss realized on the disposition of the New Note.

**_IPO Pushdown_**

Under certain circumstances, we may undertake an IPO Pushdown (as described under “Description of the
_New Notes—IPO Pushdown”). Upon consummation of the IPO Pushdown references to the Company and_
the Restricted Subsidiaries (and all related provisions) in the Indenture shall apply only to the IPO Pushdown
Entity and its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time, although the Issuer shall remain the same entity. In
such event, each holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity would be released from its obligations under
the Indenture. Such a modification to the terms of the New Notes could be treated for U.S. federal income tax
purposes as a deemed exchange of (i) the New Notes as in place prior to such modifications for (ii) modified
New Notes as in place after such modifications (“Modified Notes”). If such modifications resulted in a
deemed exchange, such a deemed exchange could be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income
tax purposes in which certain beneficial owners of the New Notes could be required to recognize gain or loss.
The amount of any gain or loss recognized upon such a deemed exchange of a New Note for a Modified Note
would be determined by reference to the “issue price” of the Modified Note. The issue price of a Modified
Note will equal the fair market value of such New Note or such Modified Note at the time of the deemed
exchange if, as seems likely, such New Note or such Modified Note were considered “publicly traded”for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. If the IPO Pushdown is treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, a U.S. Holder’s holding period in a Modified Note treated as received in the IPO Pushdown
generally will commence on the day after the IPO Pushdown, and tax basis in such Modified Note would
generally equal the issue price of such Modified Note. Generally, any gain or loss recognized as a result of
such deemed exchange will be taxed under the rules described below under “—Sale, Exchange, Redemption,
Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of New Notes.”If the issue price of such Modified Note is less than
its stated redemption price at maturity by more than a de minimis amount, such Modified Note will be treated
as issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such event, U.S.
Holders would be required to include that original issue discount in their income as it accrues, in advance of
the receipt of cash corresponding to such income. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the
U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to modification of the New Notes in connection with the IPO
Pushdown, including the U.S. federal income tax considerations of a deemed exchange and resulting OID, if
any.

**_Reportable Transactions_**

Treasury Regulations meant to require the reporting of certain tax shelter transactions cover transactions
generally not regarded as tax shelters, including certain foreign currency transactions. Under such Treasury
Regulations, certain transactions are required to be reported to the IRS, including, in certain circumstances,
a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a New Note (or euros received in respect of a New
Note) to the extent that such sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition results in a tax loss in
excess of a threshold amount. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors to determine the tax return
obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the New Notes, including any requirement to file IRS
Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).

**_Backup Withholding and Information Reporting_**

Generally, information reporting requirements may apply to payments of principal and interest on a New
Note or the proceeds from the sale of a New Note unless a U.S. Holder is an exempt recipient and, when
required, demonstrates this fact. Additionally, if a U.S. Holder that is not an exempt recipient fails to provide
its accurate taxpayer identification number and to make certain certifications, such U.S. Holder may be subject
to backup withholding.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may
be allowed as a refund or a credit against a U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability provided the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS.

Certain U.S. Holders are required to report information relating to an interest in the New Notes, subject to
certain exceptions (including an exception for New Notes held in accounts maintained by certain financial
institutions), by attaching a completed IRS Form 8938 (Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets) to


-----

their tax return for each year in which they hold an interest in the New Notes. U.S. Holders should consult
their own tax advisors regarding information reporting requirements relating to their ownership and
disposition of the New Notes.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_**

Under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (“FATCA”) a “foreign financial institution” may be required
to withhold at a rate of 30% on interest income paid on a debt obligation to persons who fail to meet certain
requirements if such interest income is treated as a “foreign passthru payment” attributable to certain U.S.
source payments. However, under proposed U.S. Treasury regulations issued in December 2018 (and upon
which taxpayers may rely until final regulations are issued), such withholding does not apply to any “foreign
passthru payment” that is made before the date that is two years after the date on which applicable final U.S.
Treasury regulations defining “foreign passthru payments” are issued. Additionally, obligations issued on or
prior to the date that is six months after the date on which applicable final Treasury Regulations defining
“foreign passthru payments” are issued generally would be “grandfathered” unless such obligations are
materially modified more than six months after such date. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum,
applicable final Treasury Regulations have not yet been filed. Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated as a foreign
financial institution, FATCA would apply to payments on the New Notes only if there is a significant
modification of the New Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes after the expiration of this grandfathering
period. Non-U.S. governments have entered into, and others are expected to enter into, intergovernmental
agreements with the United States to implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules described herein.
Investors should consult their own tax advisors on how these rules may apply to their investment in the New
Notes. In the event any withholding under FATCA is imposed with respect to any payments on the New
Notes, there generally will be no additional amounts payable to compensate for the withheld amount.

**Withholding Tax in Certain other Jurisdictions**

**_Slovenia_**

Any payments made by a Slovenian Guarantor on or under the New Notes or the Notes Guarantees will be
qualified either as the payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest. Generally, any such payments to a
foreign person that qualify as the payment of interest will be subject to withholding tax in Slovenia. No
withholding tax is payable on the payment of principal. After a Slovenian Guarantor has settled an obligation
on or under the New Notes or the Notes Guarantees, the Guarantor must establish a receivable towards the
Issuer in the amount of the settled obligation. If a Slovenian Guarantor does not establish a receivable towards
the Issuer, the payment made by the Guarantor on or under the New Notes or the Notes Guarantees might be
characterized as a hidden distribution of profit (i.e., a payment of dividend to the Issuer). In this case,
withholding tax would be due on the entire amount of the payment (and not only on the portion representing
the payment of interest).

According to Article 70 of the Slovenian Corporate Income Tax Act, withholding tax is imposed on certain
income of non-residents from a Slovenian source, including dividends and income similar to dividends,
interest (subject to certain exceptions), royalties, rent for Slovenian real estate, income from sports or art
performances (through an intermediate entity) or from consulting, marketing, legal and certain other services
when payments for such services are made to entities established in black listed countries (tax havens).

The standard withholding tax rate is 15% and in certain situations in more detail regulated in the Tax
Procedure Act it can, with effect from January 1, 2020, be 27.5%. It is the responsibility of the Slovenian payer
(e.g., a legal entity, a sole entrepreneur, a business unit of a non-resident, for example, a Slovenian branch of
a foreign company or an agent) to withhold the tax at the relevant rate at the time of payment of Slovenian
sourced income.

In certain cases it is, however, possible to apply for a reduced withholding tax rate or even an exemption from
withholding tax. Such benefits may be available under double taxation agreements Slovenia has entered into
with foreign countries. Moreover, Slovenia has fully transposed the EU Parent Subsidiary
Directive (2011/96/EU) and the EU Interest and Royalty Directive (2003/49/EC) into its national law, which
exempt transactions between certain types of companies from withholding tax, if the parties meet the
requirements on the volume and the duration of shareholding.

**_Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina_**

Withholding tax in Bosnia and Herzegovina is regulated by entity level legislation, in Federation of Bosnia
and Herzegovina by the Corporate Income Tax Act of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Official
_gazette of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Nos. 15/16 and 15/20)._


-----

Withholding tax is imposed on non-resident persons on income generated in the Federation of Bosnia and
Herzegovina from dividends, interest or financial equivalent based on the financial instruments or
arrangements, intellectual property fees, management, consulting, audit and similar intellectual services, asset
leases, entertainment events, insurance and reinsurance, and telecommunication services. The general
withholding tax rate is 10%, except for income generated from dividends, which is taxable at the rate of 5%, in
each case unless a double taxation treaty, if any, provides otherwise.

Income generated by non-resident entities from interest on loans and credits granted to resident entities for
the purpose of investment in production equipment, as well as from interest on state issued securities, is
exempt from withholding tax. In addition, income generated by reinsurance premiums paid by local reinsurers
is exempt from withholding tax.

Withholding tax is directly calculated and charged by the resident entity making the payment to a nonresident (or otherwise settling payment obligation towards non-resident), prior to the actual payment/
settlement of payment obligation, with the resident paying the withholding tax on behalf of the non-resident.

**_Luxembourg_**

The comments below are intended as a basic summary of certain withholding tax consequences in relation to
the purchase, ownership and disposal of the New Notes under Luxembourg law. Persons who are in any
doubt as to their tax position should consult a professional tax adviser.

Under Luxembourg tax law currently in effect and subject to the exception below, there is no Luxembourg
withholding tax on payments of interest (including accrued but unpaid interest) or repayments of principal.

In accordance with the law of December 23, 2005, as amended, interest payments made by Luxembourg
paying agents to individual beneficial owners resident in Luxembourg are currently subject to a 20%
withholding tax. Responsibility for withholding such tax will be assumed by the Luxembourg paying agent.

In addition, pursuant to the law of December 23, 2005, as amended, Luxembourg resident individuals can
opt to self-declare and pay a 20% tax (the “Levy”) on interest payments made by paying agents located in a
Member State of the European Union other than Luxembourg or a Member State of the European Economic
Area.

The 20% withholding tax as described above or the Levy will be in full discharge of income tax if the beneficial
owner is an individual acting in the course of the management of his/her private wealth.

**Payments by a Guarantor**

If a Guarantor makes any payment in respect of interest on Notes, such payments may be subject to
withholding tax at applicable rates subject to such relief as may be available under the provisions of any
applicable double taxation treaty or to any other exemption which may apply. It is not certain that such
payments by such Guarantor will be eligible for all the exemptions described above.


-----

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase of the New Notes by
employee benefit plans that are subject to Title I of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended (“ERISA”), plans, individual retirement accounts and other arrangements that are subject
to Section 4975 of the Code or provisions under any other federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or
regulations that are similar to such provisions of the Code or ERISA (collectively, “Similar Laws”), and
entities and accounts whose underlying assets are considered to include “plan assets” of any such plan,
account or arrangement (each, a “Plan”).

**_General Fiduciary Matters_**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title I of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (an “ERISA Plan”) and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets
of an ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who
exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the
management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee
or other compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan.

In considering an investment in the New Notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should
determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan
and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the
Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited
transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws. In addition, each Plan
should consider the fact that none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers nor any of their
respective affiliates (i) will act as a fiduciary to any Plan with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the
New Notes, and (ii) is undertaking to provide any advice or recommendation, including, without limitation,
in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to such decision. The decision to purchase and hold the New Notes must
be made by each prospective Plan purchaser on an arm’s length basis.

**_Prohibited Transaction Issues_**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified
transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of
ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is
available. A party in interest or disqualified person who engaged in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may
be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the
fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engaged in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to
penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition and/or holding of the New Notes by an
ERISA Plan with respect to which the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, or the Guarantors is considered a party
in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under
Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in
accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption.

In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions, or “PTCEs,”
that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the New Notes. These class exemptions include, without
limitation, PTCE 84 14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset
managers, PTCE 90 1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91 38 respecting bank
collective investment funds, PTCE 95 60 respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96 23
respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. Each of the above noted exemptions contains
conditions and limitations on its application. Fiduciaries of ERISA Plans considering acquiring and/or
holdings the New Notes in reliance on these or any other exemption should carefully review the exemption to
assure it is applicable. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be
satisfied.

Because of the foregoing, the New Notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing “plan
assets”of any Plan, unless such purchase and holding will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction
under ERISA and the Code or similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws.

Each purchaser and subsequent transferee of a New Note will be deemed to have given the acknowledgments,
representations and warranties as detailed under “Transfer Restrictions.”


-----

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive. Due to the complexity of
these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited
transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering purchasing the New
Notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential
applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an
exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the New Notes.

**LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE**
**SECURITY INTERESTS**

_Set out below is a summary of certain limitations on the enforceability of the Guarantees and the security_
_interests in some of the jurisdictions in which the Guarantees or Collateral are being provided. It is a summary_
_only and does not purport to be complete or to discuss all the limitations and considerations, and bankruptcy_
_or insolvency proceedings or similar events could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions as well as in any_
_jurisdiction of organization of a future guarantor of the New Notes. The application of these various laws in_
_multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply to a given situation and_
_could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights and to collect payment in full under the New Notes, the_
_Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral. Prospective investors in the New Notes should consult_
_their own legal advisors in this respect. Also set forth below is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency_
_law in the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Slovenia and Bulgaria._

**European Union**

The Guarantors in Luxembourg, Slovenia, Bulgaria and the Netherlands are organized under the laws of
Member States of the European Union.

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) no. 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the European Council of
May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings (the “E.U. Insolvency Regulation”), which applies within the
European Union, other than Denmark, the courts of the Member State in which a company’s “centre of main
interests” (which according to Article 3(1) of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation is “the place where the debtor
conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties”) is
situated have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings. The determination of where a company has
its “centre of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may
have differing and even conflicting views.

Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation the “centre of main interests” of a company is
presumed to be in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary.
This presumption only applies if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the
three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Furthermore, preamble 30
of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation states that “it should be possible to rebut this presumption where the
company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and
where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by
third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and of the management of its
interests is located in that other Member State.” In that assessment factors such as where board meetings are
held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the
location where the majority of the company’s creditors are established may all be relevant. A company’s
“centre of main interests”may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which
courts have competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency
petition unless (as set forth above) the registered office has been moved within the three-month period prior to
the filing of the insolvency petition.

The E.U. Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings which are collective insolvency proceedings
of the types referred to in Annex A to the E.U. Insolvency Regulation.

If the “centre of main interests” of a company is in one Member State (other than Denmark), under
Article 3(2) of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark)
have jurisdiction to open territorial insolvency proceedings against that company only if such company has
an “establishment” in the territory of such other Member State. An “establishment” is defined to mean a
place of operations where the company carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the
request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and
assets. The effects of those insolvency proceedings opened in that other Member State are restricted to the
assets of the company situated in such other Member State.

Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the company has its centre of main interests have not
yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can be opened in another Member State where the
company has an establishment only where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the Member
State in which the company’s centre of main interests is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the
territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in
connection with the operation of the establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where


-----

the opening of territorial proceedings is requested or (ii) a public authority which, under the law of the
Member State within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening
of insolvency proceedings.

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court opening the
main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary
proceedings have been opened there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in a Member State
which has jurisdiction to open main proceedings (because the company’s center of main interests is there)
may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that Member State in another Member State (such as
to remove assets of the company from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations so long as no
insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other Member State or any preservation measure taken to
the contrary further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the
company has assets.

**The Netherlands**

Under Dutch law, the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors which are incorporated under Dutch law
(the “Dutch Guarantors”) may be affected by (a) the standards of reasonableness and fairness (maatstaven
_van redelijkheid en billijkheid); (b) force majeure (niet toerekenbare tekortkoming) and unforeseen circumstances_
(onvoorziene omstandigheden); and (c) the other general defenses available to debtors under Dutch law in
respect of the validity, binding effect and enforceability of the New Notes. Other general defenses include
claims that a security interest should be voided because it was entered into through undue influence (misbruik
van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress (bedreiging) or error (dwaling). Other impeding factors include
suspension of performance (opschorting), dissolution of contract (ontbinding) and set-off (verrekening).
Furthermore, the courts of the Netherlands may change the effects of a contractual obligation on the basis of
abuse of authority (misbruik van bevoegdheid). Moreover, enforcement of the Guarantees or security interests
may be capable of being rescinded (vernietigd) as a result of lack of consensus ad idem (wilsgebreken) and the
legal consequences thereof. The above only applies to obligations of the Issuer and the Dutch Guarantors
that are governed by Dutch law.

The validity and enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer and the Dutch Guarantors under the New
Notes may be successfully contested by such Dutch company (or its administrator (bewindvoerder) in
suspension of payments (surseance van betaling) or its receiver (curator) in bankruptcy) on the basis of an
ultra vires claim, which will be successful if both (i) the obligations of the company do not fall within the
scope of the objects clause as set out in the company’s articles of association (doeloverschrijding) and (ii) the
company’s counterparty knew or ought to have known (without inquiry) of this fact. In determining whether
a transaction is in furtherance of the objects and purposes of such Dutch company, a court will consider
(i) the text of the objects clause in the company’s articles of association and (ii) all relevant circumstances
including whether the granting of such security interest is in the company’s corporate interests
(vennootschappelijk belang) and to its benefit and whether the company’s subsistence is jeopardized by the
granting of such security interest. The mere fact that a certain legal act (rechtshandeling) is explicitly reflected
in such Dutch company’s objects clause may not be conclusive evidence that such legal act is not ultra vires. In
addition, it is relevant whether, as a consequence of the granting of the guarantee or security interest, the
continuity of such Dutch company would foreseeably be endangered by the granting of such guarantee or
security interest. It remains possible that even if a strong financial and commercial interdependence exists
between contracting parties, the transaction may be declared void if it appears that the granting of the
guarantee or security interest cannot serve the realization of the relevant Dutch company’s objects or where it
is determined that there is a material imbalance to the disadvantage of the relevant Dutch company between
the commercial benefit on the one hand and the risks on the other hand.

A guarantee granted by a Dutch company and a security interest provided by a Dutch company may be
suspended or avoided by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam (Ondernemingskamer
_van het Gerechtshof te Amsterdam) on the motion of the holder or holders of 10% or more of the shares in_
such company or shares or depositary receipts issued therefor with a nominal value of €225,000 or more or
such lesser amount as provided in the company’s articles of association. If the company has an issued share
capital of at least €22.5 million, such motion may be made by a holder or holders of 1% or more of the shares
in such company or, provided those are listed on a qualifying trading venue, shares or depositary receipts
issued therefor with a value of €20 million or more or such lesser amount as provided in the company’s articles
of association. A trade union, other entities or persons entitled thereto in the articles of association of, or in
an agreement with, the relevant Dutch company as well as the company itself may also submit a motion to the
Enterprise Chamber for this purpose. The guarantee or security itself may further be upheld by the Enterprise
Chamber, yet actual payment under it may be suspended or avoided.


-----

To the extent Dutch law applies, any creditor of any Issuer or Dutch Guarantor (or its administrator or
receiver) may nullify any transaction or legal act entered into by any Issuer or Dutch Guarantor (or its
administrator or receiver) in connection with the New Notes (which includes the issuance of the New Notes),
under certain circumstances, if (i) any transaction or legal act entered into by any Issuer or Dutch Guarantor
in connection with the New Notes was conducted without prior existing legal obligation to do so (onverplicht),
(ii) the creditor(s) concerned or, in the case of its/their bankruptcy, any creditor was prejudiced as a
consequence of such transactions or legal act (irrespective of whether a creditor’s claim arose prior to or after
such transactions) and (iii) at the time of any transaction or legal act entered into by any Issuer or Dutch
Guarantor in connection with the New Notes was conducted, such Issuer and/or Dutch Guarantors and,
unless the transactions were conducted for no consideration (om niet), the counterparty knew or should have
known that one or more of the entities’ creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced (actio pauliana).

A receiver in bankruptcy may nullify a transaction on behalf of and for the benefit of the joint insolvent
debtor’s creditors, and the burden of proof of the abovementioned elements of fraudulent conveyance in
principle rests on the receiver. Knowledge of prejudice is however presumed by law for certain transactions
performed within a “suspect period”of one year prior to an adjudication of bankruptcy. This is applicable for
certain transactions only, the most important application being in cases where the obligations of the bankrupt
materially exceed those of the other party, the satisfaction of existing obligations of the bankrupt which are
not yet due, and acts between the bankrupt and its counterparty when the shares in both are held (indirectly)
by the same shareholder or if the bankrupt and its counterparty are part of the same group of companies.
The foregoing requirements for invoking fraudulent transfer provisions outside of a bankruptcy apply mutatis
_mutandis when invoking fraudulent transfer provisions during a bankruptcy. In addition, the receiver may_
challenge a transaction if it was conducted on the basis of a prior existing legal obligation to do so (verplichte
_rechtshandeling), if (i) the transaction was conducted at a time when the counterparty knew that a request for_
bankruptcy had been filed, or (ii) if such transaction was conducted as a result of deliberation between the
debtor and the counterparty with a view to giving preference to the counterparty over the debtor’s other
creditors. Consequently, the validity of any such transactions conducted by a Dutch legal entity may be
challenged and it is possible that such a challenge would be successful.

In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the Dutch Guarantors or any of their subsidiaries experience
financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency
or similar proceedings would be commenced or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws
may affect the enforceability of the obligations and the security of the Issuer and the Dutch Guarantors.

**_Insolvency Laws_**

The Issuer and the Dutch Guarantors are incorporated under Dutch law. Accordingly, where the Issuer and
the Dutch Guarantors have their “centre of main interests” or an “establishment in the Netherlands,” they
may be subject to Dutch insolvency proceedings governed by Dutch insolvency laws, subject to certain
exceptions as provided for in the E.U. Insolvency Regulation. In the event it was be determined by the court
that the Issuer or any of the Dutch Guarantors has its centre of main interest outside of the EU, the Issuer or
the relevant Dutch Guarantor may still be subjected to insolvency proceedings in the Netherlands due to the
fact that the EU Insolvency Regulation would not apply. In that event the Dutch courts can claim jurisdiction
based on the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet) because the Dutch Guarantor has its statutory seat in
the Netherlands.

There are two applicable corporate insolvency regimes under Dutch law in relation to corporations:
(a) suspension of payments, which is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s debts and enable
the debtor to continue as a going concern, and (b) bankruptcy (faillissement), which is primarily designed to
liquidate and distribute the debtor’s assets to its creditors. Bankruptcy is the most commonly used insolvency
regime and may result in the transfer of parts of the company as a going concern. A suspension of payments
almost always results in the debtor’s bankruptcy. Both insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch
Bankruptcy Act. A general description of the principles of both insolvency regimes is set out below. This
general description is subject to the proposals discussed under the heading “—Emergency Legislation to
_Protect Enterprises in Financial Distress due to the COVID-19 Pandemic” below._

Only the debtor can make an application for a suspension of payments, and only if it foresees that it will be
unable to continue to pay its debts as they fall due. Once the application has been filed, a court will immediately
(dadelijk) grant a provisional suspension of payments and appoint one or more administrators
(bewindvoerders). A meeting of creditors is required to decide on the definitive suspension of payments, but it
will generally be granted, unless a qualified minority (i.e., more than one quarter of the amount of claims held
by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more than one third of the number of creditors of the


-----

amount of claims held by creditors) of the unsecured, non-preferential, creditors declare against it or if there
is a valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice the creditors during a suspension of payments or if there is
no prospect that the debtor will be able to satisfy its creditors in the (near) future. The fact that the debtor
must be able to satisfy its creditors does not mean that they must be paid in full. It suffices that creditors can
be satisfied to some extent (for example, by receiving a percentage of their claims within the framework of a
composition). Other than in the case of the ordering by a competent court of a statutory stay of execution of
up to two months (extendable by another period of up to two months) imposed by court order, a suspension
of payments will only affect unsecured, non-preferential creditors. During such stay of execution, a secured
creditor may not, without the court’s consent (i) claim the asset subject to the security right if it is under the
control of (in de macht van) the debtor subject to a suspension of payments or (ii) seek recourse against the
asset.

Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it has ceased to pay its debts. Bankruptcy can be
requested by a creditor of the debtor or the holder of a security interest over a claim from such creditor, when
there is at least one other creditor. At least one of the claims (of the creditor requesting bankruptcy or the
other creditor) needs to be due and payable. Bankruptcy can also be declared in certain circumstances when a
debtor is subject to a suspension of payments. The debtor can also request the application of bankruptcy
proceedings itself, provided it has obtained prior approval of its general meeting to file an application for its
bankruptcy. The articles of association of the debtor can preclude the necessity of such general meeting
approval. Furthermore, the Public Prosecution Service (het Openbaar Ministerie) can request the application
of bankruptcy proceedings for reasons of public interest (openbaar belang). In Dutch bankruptcy proceedings,
a debtor’s assets are generally liquidated and the proceeds distributed to the debtor’s creditors according to
the relative priority of those creditors’ claims and, to the extent certain creditors’ claims have equal priority, in
proportion to the amount of such claims. Certain parties, such as secured creditors, will benefit from special
rights. Secured creditors, such as pledgees and mortgagees, may enforce their rights separately from suspension
of payments or bankruptcy and do not have to contribute to the liquidation costs; however, enforcement of
the security interest might be subject to the following: (a) a statutory stay of execution of up to two months
extendable by another period of up to two months imposed by court order pursuant to Article 63a of the
Dutch Bankruptcy Act (which may be a total period of eight months if the similar statutory stay of execution
under Article 241a of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (referred to above) is first applied during suspension of
payments), which has the same effects as set forth above for stays of execution in suspensions of payment;
(b) a receiver (curator) can force a secured party to foreclose its security interest within a reasonable time (as
determined by the receiver pursuant to Article 58(1) of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act), failing which the receiver
will be entitled to sell the relevant rights or assets and distribute the proceeds to the secured party after a
deduction of liquidation costs; and (c) excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned to the company’s
receiver and may not be offset against an unsecured claim of the company’s secured creditor.

Unlike Chapter 11 proceedings under U.S. bankruptcy law, where both secured and unsecured creditors are
generally barred from seeking to recover on their claims, suspension of payment and bankruptcy proceedings
against the Issuer and the Dutch Guarantors would allow secured creditors (and in case of suspension of
payments also preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities)) to satisfy their claims by
proceeding against the assets (that secure their claims) as if there were no bankruptcy or suspension of
payments. However, a statutory stay of execution of up to two months, extendable by another period of up to
two months, may be declared applicable. Furthermore, certain preferred creditors have a preference by virtue
of law. Unlike secured creditors, preferred creditors are not entitled to foreclose on assets of the bankrupt.
They do have priority in the distribution of the proceeds of the bankrupt’s assets.

Restrictions on the enforcement of security interests may apply. For instance, higher ranking rights must be
respected. These may include secured creditors and tax and social security authorities. A statutory stay of
execution of security rights and other rights as described above may be imposed. Further, a receiver in
bankruptcy can force a secured creditor to enforce its security interest within a reasonable period of time. If
such time is not met, the receiver will be entitled to sell the secured assets, if any, and the secured creditor will
have a preferred claim in respect of the proceeds, meaning that the secured creditor will have to share in the
bankruptcy costs, which may be significant. Excess proceeds of any enforcement must be returned to the
bankrupt estate; they may not be off set against an unsecured claim of the secured creditor. Such set-off may
be allowed prior to the bankruptcy, although at that time it may be subject to clawback in the case of
fraudulent conveyance or bad faith in obtaining the claim used for set-off.

Any pending executions of judgments against the debtor will be suspended by operation of law when
suspension of payments is granted and terminate by operation of law when bankruptcy is declared. In
addition, all attachments on the debtor’s assets will cease to have effect upon the suspension of payments


-----

having become definitive, a composition having been ratified by the court or the declaration of bankruptcy
(as the case may be) subject to the ability of the court to set an earlier date for such termination. Litigation
pending on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically stayed. Under Dutch law, bankruptcy and
suspension of payment generally take effect at 00.00 a.m. on the day of the judgment of the bankruptcy or the
suspension of payments.

Both in a definitive suspension of payments and bankruptcy, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to
creditors. A composition will be binding for all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is: (i) approved
by a simple majority (gewone meerderheid) of the number of creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting,
representing at least 50% of the amount of the claims that are acknowledged and conditionally admitted, and
(ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Consequently, Dutch insolvency law could preclude or
inhibit the ability of the holders of the New Notes to effect a restructuring and could reduce the recovery of
a holder of Notes in a Dutch suspension of payments proceeding or bankruptcy. Interest accruing after the
date on which a suspension of payments or bankruptcy is granted, cannot be claimed in a composition.

All unsecured and non-preferential pre-bankruptcy claims will have to be verified in the insolvency
proceedings in order to be entitled to vote and, in a bankruptcy liquidation, to be entitled to distributions. As
a general rule, claims of unsecured and non-preferential creditors will have to be submitted to the receiver in
bankruptcy to be verified. If the bankruptcy has ended with a composition, a claim that has not been
submitted for verification within the deadline set therefore can no longer be enforced. Any remaining funds
will be distributed to the company’s shareholders. “Verification” under Dutch law means, in the case of a
suspension of payments, that the treatment of a disputed claim for voting purposes is determined and, in the
case of a bankruptcy, the unsecured and non-preferential pre-bankruptcy claims are submitted to the receiver
in bankruptcy for verification, and the receiver in bankruptcy then makes a determination as to the claim’s
existence, ranking and value and whether and to what extent it should be admitted in the bankruptcy
proceedings (for voting).

In the situation of bankruptcy, creditors that wish to dispute the receiver’s verification of their claims will be
referred to a claim validation proceeding (renvooiprocedure) in order to establish the amount and rank of the
disputed claim, while in suspension of payments the court will decide how a disputed claim will be treated for
voting purposes. These procedures could cause holders of Notes to recover less than the principal amount of
their Notes or less than they could recover in a U.S. liquidation proceeding. The renvooi proceedings could
also cause payments to the holders of Notes to be delayed. Interest on the New Notes accruing after the
bankruptcy order date cannot be admitted unless secured by a pledge or mortgage, in which case interest will
be admitted pro memoria. To the extent that an interest is not covered by the proceeds of the security, the
creditor may not derive any rights from the admission. No interest is payable in respect of unsecured claims as
of the date of a bankruptcy.

Creditors of secured claims, such as the holders of the New Notes, and preferential creditors with respect to
certain assets of a debtor, who expect that the proceeds of a future enforcement against the assets subject to
the security or their preferred rights, as the case may be, will be insufficient to satisfy their claim in full, may
request to receive the same rights as unsecured and non-preferential creditors with respect to the expected
remainder of their claim, with preservation of their rights as a secured or preferential creditor in respect of
the secured asset or the asset the relevant preferential right relates to. If a secured creditor enforces its security
rights prior to the expiry of the period for submitting claims for verification, and the proceeds of such
enforcement are insufficient to satisfy its claim in full, the remainder of that claim may be submitted to the
receiver in bankruptcy in order to be verified.

The Existing Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of Parallel Debt obligations in favor of the
Security Agent. For any risks related to the Dutch law Parallel Debt structure, see “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the New Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The security interests in the Collateral will be_
_granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to you. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of_
_the Collateral may be restricted by local law.”_

Under Dutch law, it is uncertain as to whether security interests can be granted to a party other than the
creditor of the claim which is purported to be secured by such security interests. As a consequence, the Existing
Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of parallel debt (Parallel Debt) obligations in favor of the
Security Agent mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors towards the holders of the New
Notes under or in connection with the Indenture (the Principal Obligations). The Dutch law security interests
are, and will be, granted to the Security Agent as security for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the
Principal Obligations. The Parallel Debt will be at all times in the same amount and payable at the same time
as the Principal Obligations. Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the


-----

corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding
Principal Obligations. In respect of the security interest granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the
New Notes will not have direct security and will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such
security except through the Security Agent. As a result, the holders of the New Notes bear some risks
associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt
concept has not been tested under Dutch law and, to the extent that the security interests in the collateral
created to secure the Parallel Debt are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the New Notes will
not (directly) receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the collateral. However, the
mechanism of Parallel Debt is commonly accepted and applied in the Dutch market.

With the entry into force of the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans (Wet
_homologatie onderhands akkoord) (“Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans”) on_
1 January 2021, debtors now have the possibility to offer a composition outside of formal insolvency
proceedings. The Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans is based on the UK Scheme
of Arrangements and the US Chapter 11 procedure and it offers debtors additional possibilities to restructure
their debt. Unlike a composition in suspension of payments and in bankruptcy, a composition under the Act
on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans can be offered to secured creditors as well as
shareholders. The Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans provides, inter alia, for
cross class cramdown, the restructuring of group company obligations through either one or more aligned
proceedings, the termination of onerous contracts with deactivation of ipso facto, and supporting court
measures. Such composition may result in claims against the Dutch Guarantors being compromised if the
relevant majority of creditors within a class or a more senior class vote in favor of such a composition. A
composition plan under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans can extend to
claims against entities that are not incorporated under Dutch law and/or are residing outside the Netherlands.
Accordingly, the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans can affect the rights of the
Trustee and/or the holders of the New Notes under the Indenture and therefore the New Notes.

Under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans voting on a composition plan is
done in classes. Approval by a class requires a decision adopted with a majority of two third of the claims of
that class that have voted on the plan or, in the case of a class of shareholders, two thirds of the shares of that
class that have voted on the plan. The Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans
provides for the possibility for a composition plan to be binding on a non-consenting class (cross class
cramdown). Under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans, the court will
confirm a composition plan if at least one class of creditors (other than a class of shareholders) that can be
expected to receive a distribution in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor approves the plan, unless there is a
statutory ground for refusal. The court can, inter alia, refuse confirmation of a composition plan on the basis
of (i) a request by an affected creditor of a consenting class if the value of the distribution that such creditor
receives under the plan is lower than the distribution it can be expected to receive in case of a bankruptcy of
the debtor or (ii) a request of an affected creditor of a non-consenting class, if the plan provides for a
distribution of value that deviates from the statutory or contractual ranking and priority to the detriment of
that class.

Under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans, the court may grant a stay on
enforcement of a maximum of 4 months, with a possible extension of 4 months. During such period, inter
_alia, all enforcement action against the assets of (or in the possession of) the debtor is suspended, including_
action to enforce security over the assets of the debtor. Accordingly, during such stay a pledgee of claims may
not collect nor notify the debtors of such pledged claims of its rights of pledge.

**_Emergency Legislation to Protect Enterprises in Financial Distress due to the COVID-19 Pandemic_**

The Dutch Parliament has adopted emergency legislation regarding a temporary suspension of enforcement
and other measures in support of enterprises during the COVID-19 pandemic (Tijdelijke wet COVID-19
_SZW en JenV). The emergency legislation provides for a court ordered moratorium and several related_
protections which apply until at least August 1, 2021 and can, if and when necessary, be extended beyond that
date for two month periods at a time.

The measures of the legislation apply to enterprises (other than regulated entities) whose continuity is
threatened due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to a request from creditors (other than the Tax
authorities) to declare the enterprise bankrupt or initiate the execution or seizure of assets, the enterprise/
debtor can request the court to grant a moratorium vis à vis those creditors of two months (which may be
extended twice at the request of the enterprise/debtor by two month periods at a time), and if such moratorium
is granted by the court then during such period:


-----

(i) the bankruptcy petition is stayed;

(ii) payment obligations to those creditors are suspended, and any prior default does not, in and of itself,
provide a legal basis to change the terms or suspend performance of, or terminate, an agreement with
those creditors; and

(iii) if the court so decides, conservatory and executory attachments by those creditors are suspended, and no
other enforcement measures can (continue to) be taken by those creditors against the assets of their
debtor without the prior approval of the court.

The measures referred to in (iii) can also be requested in summary proceedings and attachments can be
terminated as part of such proceedings. It is important to note that any measure of the court only affects
those creditors who requested the bankruptcy or initiated the execution or seizure of assets of the debtor.
However, any request by other creditors will most likely result in the court taking the same decisions.

When considering the request to apply the measures discussed above, the court will need to establish that the
enterprise/debtor has made it plausible that, solely or mainly due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic,
the enterprise has not been able to continue its business as usual and as a result has temporarily become
unable to pay its debts when they fall due. Creditors not covered by the moratorium retain these rights vis à vis
their debtor. The enterprise/debtor is in any event presumed to be in this position if it can provide financial
information that shows that prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic or the restrictive measures
announced since March 15, 2020 (i) it had sufficient liquidity to satisfy its due and payable debts, and (ii) its
revenue decreased by at least 20% compared to the average revenue in the preceding three-months. The court
will further need to conclude that following the moratorium the enterprise/debtor will be able to satisfy its
debts and that the creditor(s) that are affected are not significantly and unreasonably prejudiced as a result of
the moratorium. When granting a moratorium, the court can take any measures it considers necessary to
ensure the interests of the creditor(s) are not prejudiced.

**Slovenia**

**_Certain Slovenian Companies and Insolvency Law Considerations_**

The granting of up-stream or cross-stream guarantees and security under Slovenian law is limited.

According to the Slovenian Companies Act (Zakon o gospodarskih družbah—ZGD 1—Companies Act), as
amended, joint stock companies are prohibited from providing funds to anyone for the purpose of acquiring
the companies’ shares and from guaranteeing or otherwise securing the repayment of such funds. While the
statutory restrictions of financial assistance expressly refer only to joint stock companies and the acquisition
of their shares, it is possible that a court would also apply these rules to the acquisition of shares of a direct or
indirect parent of the relevant joint stock company or for limited liability companies. Given the prohibition
on financial assistance, it is not certain if a Slovenian joint stock company may provide upstream or cross
stream guarantees. Setting aside the financial assistance prohibition, the amount of the guarantee should in
any event not exceed whatever amounts the company receives in consideration for providing the guarantee.

Guarantees and other types of security granted by a company for purposes other than the acquisition of its
own shares are not covered by the financial assistance rules and instead must be analyzed in light of the
capital maintenance provisions of the Companies Act, which apply to limited liability companies and joint
stock companies. Such rules provide for (i) in respect of limited liability companies a prohibition of making
payments to the shareholder or making a legal transaction with a similar legal effect (e.g. guarantee with its
assets for any indebtedness of the shareholder) to the extent that this would prevent preservation of the
company’s (1) minimal lawfully allowed share capital (najnižji znesek osnovnega kapitala) (being
EUR 7,500), (2) actually registered share capital (osnovni kapital) and (3) tied up reserves (vezane rezerve), and
(ii) in respect of joint stock companies a prohibition of return of equity (prepoved vračila vložkov) and a
prohibition of concealed payment of profit (prepoved prikritega izplačila dobička). Pursuant to these rules, a
shareholder is generally only entitled to participate in a company’s distributable profit but has no rights with
respect to the company’s assets except in the case of the winding up of the company. Thus, any payment by a
company to a shareholder, including any other transfer of economic benefits, that is not profit participation
is generally prohibited.

As the grant by a company of a guarantee or other type of security for the benefit of one of its shareholders
to secure an obligation of such shareholder towards a third-party or to secure the obligation of another
company forming part of the same group gives rise to a material benefit to the shareholder, the grant of such


-----

guarantee or security is subject to the capital maintenance rules and thus permitted only if certain legal
requirements are met.

A limited liability company may not pay any portion of its share capital and tied up reserves to shareholders,
either directly or indirectly. This means that the grant of a guarantee or other security by a company for the
benefit of a shareholder is permitted only to the extent that the amount covered by the guarantee or security
does not endanger the company’s share capital and tied up reserves. To the extent the amount in question does
endanger the company’s share capital and tied up reserves, the guarantee or other security is permitted only if
the grant of the security is commercially justified based on arm’s length principles. This is the case if the
benefits to the company outweigh the risks involved and the grant does not affect the company’s liquidity,
e.g., if adequate security for the potential liability is provided to the company or there are other benefits to the
company. Under no circumstances, however, must a company grant a guarantee or other type of security if
doing so could reasonably be expected to affect its liquidity or lead to its insolvency (e.g., because the
beneficiary of the guarantee has a particularly low degree of creditworthiness)—even if the company receives
a monetary equivalent from the shareholder, as in such case the grant of the guarantee or other security is
never commercially justified.

Similar rules apply in respect of a joint stock company, with the additional limitation that a joint stock
company is prohibited from any payment which would represent a return of equity or a concealed payment of
profit.

If a company grants a guarantee or other type of security to a shareholder in contravention of the capital
maintenance rules, the shareholder must pay-back the received benefit. If the shareholder was acting bona
fide, the repayment may only be requested if it is needed for repayment of a company’s debt to its creditors.
The liable shareholder may not be set free of its repayment obligations. The prescription period for the
repayment starts to lapse with the day when the unjustified payment was made.

In addition, any violation of the capital maintenance or financial assistance rules exposes the directors or
managers of the Slovenian Guarantor to personal and criminal liability. In addition, the guarantee could
itself be held null and void.

**_Insolvency Law_**

For Slovenian law purposes, insolvency is (in summary) defined as a situation where a debtor is unable to
settle its obligations as they fall due for a certain period of time. Unless proven otherwise, a debtor is deemed
insolvent if:

- the debtor is more than two months late in paying one or more of its obligations that together exceed 20%
of all of its obligations, as shown in the debtor’s latest published annual report; or

- the monies standing to the credit of the debtor’s bank account are not sufficient to pay the whole amount
enforceable under a writ of execution (sklep o izvršbi) or to pay the enforcement draft (izvršnica), and such
status continues for 60 consecutive days or for more than 60 days within a period of 90 days, and still exists
on the day preceding the filing of the bankruptcy petition; or

- the debtor does not have an account with a payment services provider in Slovenia and in the 60 days
following the finality of the writ of execution has not settled its obligations deriving therefrom, or

- after the final confirmation of a compulsory settlement or simplified compulsory settlement over the debtor,
if the debtor is more than two months late with the payment of its obligations under the (simplified)
compulsory settlement or with the payment of obligations towards secured creditors that arose before the
(simplified) compulsory settlement proceedings commenced or with any other financial restructuring
measures stipulated in the financial restructuring plan; or

- the value of the debtor’s obligations exceeds the value of its assets; or

- the debtor’s current year loss together with any loss brought forward from previous years is equal to, or
greater than, half of its subscribed capital, and that loss cannot be covered by the profit brought forward or
reserves.

Further, the debtor is deemed insolvent (and is not allowed to prove otherwise) if it is over two months late in
paying its employees their salaries up to the amount of minimum salaries or taxes and contributions that are
paid together with salaries, and that delay still exists on the day preceding submission of a petition for the
filing of the insolvency petition. Additionally, it is possible that certain Slovenian laws regulating intervention
measures in respect of the COVID-19 pandemic include additional non-rebuttable presumptions of


-----

insolvency. For instance, until September 30, 2020, a debtor was also deemed insolvent (without the option to
prove otherwise) if it was late in paying the salaries and salary related contributions for more than one month
from the day it received certain reimbursements based on the intervention measures adopted with the aim of
retaining employment in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Under Slovenian law, the following types of insolvency proceedings may be opened against a company having
its centre of main interest in Slovenia within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation:

- bankruptcy proceeding (stečaj). The opening of these types of proceedings may be requested by the
company, any personally liable shareholder of the company, any of its creditors, or the Public Guarantee
and Maintenance Fund of the Republic of Slovenia (this fund provides protection of rights of those
workers whose employment was terminated due to employer insolvency). During bankruptcy proceedings,
the bankrupt company is administered by a bankruptcy administrator.

- compulsory settlement proceeding (prisilna poravnava). The opening of these types of proceedings may
be requested by the company, a personally liable shareholder of the company or by creditors of the company
whose combined financial claims amount to more than 20 per cent of the company’s financial obligations.
The purpose of the compulsory settlement procedure is to enable a debtor that became insolvent to
financially restructure, providing for its liquidity and solvency, and to ensure the creditors receive more
favorable payment conditions for their claims than in the case of bankruptcy proceedings.

- simplified compulsory settlement proceeding (poenostavljena prisilna poravnava). Simplified compulsory
settlement proceedings are permitted, if the debtor is a micro sized company (as specified in the Slovenian
Companies Act based on the following criteria: the average number of employees in a business year, the net
proceeds from sales and the value of the assets) or a sole proprietor who meets the criteria stated in the
Slovenian Companies Act for micro or a small sized companies. The opening of these types of proceedings
may be requested only by the debtor (company/sole proprietor) or a personally liable shareholder of the
company.

In the event that a company is at risk of becoming insolvent within one year, a company (other than a micro
sized company) may restructure its financial liabilities in so called preventive restructuring proceedings
(postopek preventivnega prestrukturiranja) in order to reduce the risk of insolvency. Preventive restructuring
proceedings are not considered to be insolvency proceedings in the technical sense. This is because they enable
a company to take financial restructuring measures in order to avoid becoming insolvent by entering into an
agreement for a financial restructuring with its creditors.

In relation to secondary proceedings within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation, if an entity has an
establishment in Slovenia, the only insolvency proceedings that may be opened are bankruptcy proceedings
(stečaj).

In the event of a liquidation of a Slovenian Guarantor following bankruptcy, the liability of the Slovenian
Guarantor in respect to the New Notes will only rank after the cost of the liquidation proceedings (including
any debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and any debts of the relevant entity that enjoy a more
senior or preferential status under the Slovenian law. Preferential debts may include, among others:

- remuneration owed to employees for the last six months preceding the insolvency proceeding;

- compensation (damages) for work related accidents and occupational diseases;

- redundancy payments for workers dismissed prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings; and

- taxes and social security contributions related to the remuneration (for the period of the last six months)
and redundancy payments as well as social security contributions for a period prior to the opening of the
insolvency proceeding.

Assets over which a security interest has been granted will, in principle, not be available for distribution to
unsecured and un preferred creditors, unless a surplus is realized.

Certain legal actions of a debtor in an insolvency procedure can be challenged in court if they were concluded
or carried out during the twelve month period prior to the submission of a petition for beginning of the
insolvency procedure.

A legal action of an insolvent debtor may be challenged if such action results in either a decrease in the net
value of assets of the debtor, so that the pool of assets available to other creditors is reduced, or a person for
the benefit of whom the act has been executed, having obtained more favorable payment conditions for a


-----

claim against the debtor in bankruptcy, and a person for the benefit of which the act was executed, at the time
when such act was executed, was aware of, or should have been aware of, the fact that the debtor was insolvent.

If the other person did not provide any exchange (consideration) or if the value of such exchange was small,
such legal action can be challenged if it was concluded during a period of 36 months prior to the filing of the
motion for the commencement of insolvency proceedings and even if the other person was not aware of or
did not need to be aware of the fact that the debtor was insolvent.

Challenging of legal actions is also available under general rules of Slovenian civil law (i.e. also outside
insolvency).

In general, the opening of insolvency proceedings by a Slovenian court does not result in the automatic
termination of contracts; however the insolvency administrator may choose to terminate certain contracts as
to avoid the worsening of the financial condition of the company. Any power of attorney terminates upon
initiation of bankruptcy proceedings.

Insolvency proceedings may therefore have a material adverse effect on the relevant Slovenian Guarantor’s
business and assets and the Slovenian Guarantor’s respective obligations with respect to the New Notes.

**_Certain Slovenian Collateral Law Considerations_**

According to the Slovenian Private International Law and Procedure Act and the Regulation (EC)
No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to
contractual obligations (Rome I), Slovenian courts will apply the lex rei sitae, which is the law of the place
where the assets or subject matter of the pledge or security interest are situated.

Therefore, the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over assets such as registered shares
in Slovenian companies, tangible assets located in Slovenia, receivables/claims governed by Slovenian law and
having debtors located in Slovenia, bank accounts held in Slovenia, etc. will be subject to Slovenian law.

Under Slovenian law, it is uncertain as to whether security interests can be granted to a party other than the
creditor of the claim that is purported to be secured by such security interests. As a consequence, the
Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of parallel debt (Parallel Debt) obligations in favor of
the Security Agent mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors towards the holders of the
New Notes under or in connection with the Indenture (the Principal Obligations). The Slovenian law security
interests will be granted to the Security Agent as security for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the
Principal Obligations. The Parallel Debt will be at all times in the same amount and payable at the same time
as the Principal Obligations. Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the
corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding
Principal Obligations. In respect of the security interest granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the
New Notes will not have direct security and will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such
security except through the Security Agent.

In addition, the Parallel Debt construct has not been tested under Slovenian law and, to the extent that the
security interests in the collateral created to secure the Parallel Debt are successfully challenged by other
parties, holders of the New Notes will not (directly) receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the security
interests in the collateral.

**_Enforcement Proceedings_**

Under Slovenian law, depending on the type of security certain perfection requirements must be satisfied in
order for a security to become enforceable against third parties. If these perfection requirements are not
satisfied a holder of security interest may experience difficulties enforcing its rights with respect to the
collateral against third parties, including administrators in insolvency proceedings or other creditors that
claim a security interest in the same collateral.

- In the case of a pledge over the shares of a limited liability company, the agreement must be drawn up in the
form of a notarial deed and registration of the security interest in the court register of the relevant Slovenian
company is required. If a secured claim is not settled at maturity, the shares may be sold through (i) a court
enforced sale or (ii) an out of court sale. If the security agreement is concluded between commercial entities,
it is presumed that the parties agreed on an out of court sale; in all other cases, the parties must conclude an
agreement on an out of court sale in writing.


-----

- In case of a pledge over the shares of a joint stock company, the security interest must be entered in the
central register maintained by the KDD (Slovene Central Securities Clearing Corporation).

- In case of a pledge over receivables, the pledgor must notify the debtor of the pledged receivable. Upon
receipt of the notification, the debtor of the pledged receivable may only validly pay to the pledgee and the
pledgee is not required to initiate a procedure against the pledger, but can demand and enforce the payment
directly against the debtor of the pledged receivable. In case of a pecuniary claim, the creditor must, at the
request of the pledger, deposit the collected amount with the court.

Court enforcement proceedings are regulated by the Slovenian Enforcement and Securing of Civil Claims Act
(Zakon o izvršbi in zavarovanju—ZIZ—Enforcement Act). According to the Enforcement Act, enforcement
procedures may be commenced only upon obtaining a valid enforcement title which may be in the form of
either (i) an enforceable court decision, (ii) a court settlement, (iii) an enforceable notarial deed, or (iv) another
enforceable decision or instrument that is an enforceable title according to the law, a ratified and published
international treaty or a legal act of the European Union that is directly applicable in the Republic of Slovenia.
Therefore, if an agreement is drawn up in the form of a directly enforceable notarial deed (with all documents
and attachments in certified Slovenian translations), the enforcement procedure may be commenced without
any further litigation.

The enforcement procedure starts with the creditor filing a proposal for enforcement. In this proposal, the
creditor must provide information about the legal title upon which the enforcement is based, the debtor’s
obligation, the enforcement measure or the relevant debtor’s assets that are targeted by the procedure (objects
of enforcement). There is no deadline for the court to decide on the enforcement proposal. In practice, in most
cases the court reaches a decision within about two weeks. As long as there is a valid enforcement title, courts
will generally grant the enforcement. The debtor and any third-party with a right to the object of enforcement
that prevents enforcement may file an objection against a decision granting enforcement.

Any costs associated with an enforcement procedure (court fees, bailiff fees, etc.) are initially borne by the
person filing a proposal for enforcement, however, after the sale of a security interest, any distribution proceeds
are first used to reimburse the costs and expenses of the enforcement procedure.

The Enforcement Act regulates in detail the enforcement procedures with respect to different types of assets
(e.g., enforcement over real estate, receivables, movables and similar) as well as the procedures with respect to
different types of claims (e.g., monetary claims, claims regarding the handing over of a real estate or movables
and similar).

The means of enforcement of monetary claims under the Enforcement Act are:

- enforcement by seizing movables, appraisal of their value, sale of the movables and repayment of a creditor
from the money acquired through the sale of the movables;

- enforcement by seizing a monetary claim of a debtor and transferring the monetary claim to a creditor;

- enforcement by blocking a debtor’s assets on bank accounts and transferring the blocked assets to a creditor
after the required conditions are met;

- enforcement by seizing a debtor’s claim to have certain (im)movables handed over to it, transferring this
claim to the creditor and sale of the object;

- enforcement by seizing and monetizing other assets or material rights of a debtor (e.g., a patent, right to
usage and similar);

- enforcement over securities;

- enforcement over business shares by registering enforcement in the business registry and selling the business
shares; and

- enforcement over real estate with a registration of the enforcement into the real estate register, appraisal of
the value of the real estate, sale of the real estate and repayment of a creditor from the money acquired
through the sale of the real estate.

Certain assets of the debtor may not be subject of enforcement, whereby generally such limitations do not
apply, among others, to enforcement of claims secured with a pledge over such assets.

When enforcement is pursued out of court (when so allowed by the law, and, if so required, agreed
contractually):


-----

- a share in a limited liability company or the shares in a joint stock company can generally only be sold in a
public auction (whereby certain Slovenian legal scholars argue that any kind of invitation made to the
public to purchase or provide bids is sufficient). Exceptionally, a direct sale (i.e. without a public auction) is
allowed if the shares (of a joint stock company) have a stock exchange price. The auction or the direct sale
(as applicable) can be performed after an 8 day prior notice to the debtor of the secured claim and to the
pledgor (if not the same person). The pledgee must timely notify both the debtor of the secured claim and
the pledgor of the date and place of the sale. Any surplus of the proceeds over the secured claim must be
delivered to the pledgee;

- enforcement over a pledged receivable is performed by collection of the receivable from the debtor or, in
case of bankruptcy or compulsory settlement, by reporting the right to separate repayment in the respective
proceedings and repayment in the context of such proceedings; and

- blank signed bills of exchange can be enforced by due completion of the blank places and submission for
payment from the respective bank account of their issuer.

**Serbia**

**_Insolvency Law_**

Under the Serbian Insolvency Law, insolvency proceedings can (but do not have to) be opened if at least one
of the following conditions is met:

- Actual insolvency. The debtor is unable to pay its debts within 45 days from their due date or has
completely ceased all payments for a consecutive period of 30 days; permanent insolvency is presumed if
the petition for the opening of insolvency procedures is filed by a creditor who was unable to obtain
satisfaction of his monetary claims by any of the means of enforcement in a judicial or tax enforcement
proceeding in Serbia.

- Pending (threatening) insolvency. The debtor is able to prove that he will likely not be able to pay its
existing debts as they become due.

- Over indebtedness. The liabilities of the debtor exceed its assets.

- Failure to comply with the adopted reorganization plan or if the reorganization plan was put into effect in
a fraudulent or unlawful manner.

The opening of insolvency proceedings (stečaj) may be requested by any of the debtor’s creditors, the debtor
itself or the debtor’s liquidation administrator. During the insolvency proceedings, the estate (assets) of the
insolvency debtor, and the debts, are administered by the insolvency administrator.

The insolvency proceedings may be conducted as bankruptcy proceedings or as reorganization proceedings.
In bankruptcy proceedings, creditors are satisfied through the sale of the debtor’s assets, or the sale of the
debtor as a legal entity. In reorganization proceedings, creditors are satisfied by redefinition of their relations
(haircut and/or reprogram) with the debtor or in another manner provided for in the plan. There are two types
of procedures for adoption of a reorganization plan (i.e. two types of reorganization): (i) regular procedure,
after the formal opening of insolvency proceedings and (ii) prepacked reorganization (i.e., reorganization on
the basis of a prepacked reorganization plan submitted by the insolvency debtor jointly with the proposal for
initiation of insolvency proceeding (provided any of the grounds for the opening of insolvency proceeding
exist)). Although the two types of reorganizations are similar, the main difference is, besides the timing of the
submission of a draft reorganization plan, in that the prepacked reorganization plan includes, inter alia,
signed non-binding statements of the majority of creditors per value of their claims from each class specified
in the plan, that they agree with the contents of the proposed prepacked reorganization plan and are willing
to vote for its adoption. Another important difference between these reorganizations is in that if a prepacked
reorganization plan is not adopted, the insolvency proceedings terminate, while if a reorganization plan is not
adopted in the pending insolvency proceedings, the proceedings continue as bankruptcy. A prepacked
reorganization may be initiated only by the debtor, while a reorganization plan in a regular procedure may be
submitted by: (i) the insolvency administrator; (ii) any secured creditor; (iii) any insolvency creditor; and
(iv) shareholders holding at least 30% of the debtor’s issued share capital.

The claims are satisfied in the following order:

- expenses associated with the insolvency proceedings, which are settled from the insolvency estate as a matter
of priority;

- any obligations incurred by the insolvency estate; and


-----

- the claims of insolvency creditors, which are satisfied according to their rank.

Insolvency claims are ranked as follows:

- first-ranking claims comprise (i) unpaid net salaries of employees and former employees in the amount of
a yearly minimum wage for the year prior to the opening of insolvency together with interest from the due
date to the date of the opening of insolvency; (ii) unpaid contributions for mandatory pension and disability
insurance for two years prior to the opening of insolvency and (iii) claims arising from contracts with
companies the subject of which are unpaid contributions for mandatory pension and disability insurances
for two years before the opening of insolvency (the basis for the calculation of the contributions under
(ii) and (iii) is the minimum monthly social security contributions basis as at the date of opening of
insolvency proceedings);

- second ranking claims comprise all public revenue claims that have become due over the last three-months
prior to the opening of insolvency, except mandatory pension and disability insurance contributions for
employees;

- third ranking claims comprise claims of other insolvency creditors (unsecured claims); and

- fourth ranking claims comprise claims that arose within two years before the opening of the insolvency
proceedings under or in connection with loans or other economically equivalent transactions to the extent
such loans or equivalent transactions are unsecured and were granted by an affiliate of the debtor who is
not regularly engaged in the business of providing credits and loans.

Claims of creditors which have, prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings, contractually agreed to
subordination will be settled only after the settlement in full of the third ranking claims with accompanying
interest(s).

Assets over which security interests have been granted are generally not available for distribution to unsecured
and non-preferred creditors, unless a surplus is realized from the sale of such assets. The following three types
of creditors are not considered to be insolvency creditors:

- secured creditors (razlučni poverioci), i.e., creditors who have a pledge right (založno pravo), statutory
retention right, or a right of settlement on the assets or rights recorded in public records. They are entitled
to primary settlement from the proceeds of the sale of the assets or the collection of claims over which that
right has been granted. If a secured creditor’s claim exceeds such proceeds, the secured creditor is an
insolvency creditor with respect to the remaining portion of its claim. Secured claims acquired through
enforcement proceedings or creating of a charge within 60 days before the date of opening the insolvency
proceedings for the purpose of enforcement or security shall cease to be valid; such creditors shall not be
deemed secured creditors.

- pledge creditors (založni poverioci), i.e., persons who have a pledge over property or rights of the debtor
that is recorded in the public records, but do not have a monetary claim (secured by such pledge) against the
debtor (i.e., the monetary claim secured by that pledge is a claim of a third-party), must inform the court
about the pledge within a specified deadline and provide evidence of the existence of the relevant pledge
together with a statement of the amount of the secured monetary claim against third-party (as of the date
of the opening of the insolvency proceedings). Pledge creditors may not vote for, nor be voted as, members
of an insolvency creditors’ assembly or an insolvency creditors’ committee; and

- separation creditors, i.e., persons who on the basis of their property rights or personal rights, have the right
to request a certain asset to be excluded from the insolvency estate. Separation creditors are not insolvency
creditors. However, in a case where the bankruptcy debtor has transferred these assets in the course of
insolvency proceedings without being authorized to do so, a separation creditor has the right to request
satisfaction of its claim in an amount equal to the market value of the asset plus compensation of damage,
and such request is to be settled as a liability of the insolvency estate (in priority over claims of insolvency
creditors).

Legal transactions and other actions entered into or taken before the opening of the insolvency proceedings
that interfere with the principle of the equal settlement of insolvency creditors or are damaging the creditors,
as well as transactions and actions putting some creditors in a more favorable position over other creditors
(“favoring creditors”) may be contested by the insolvency administrator or by other creditors:

- Any action providing security or settlement to a creditor in a manner and at a time that corresponds to the
substance of such creditor’s right (“regular settlement”) taken within six months before the filing of a
petition for initiation of insolvency proceedings may be contested if the debtor was insolvent at the time of


-----

the transaction, and the creditor knew or should have known of its insolvency. Regular settlements after
the filing of the petition to open insolvency proceedings may also be contested if the creditor knew or
should have known that the debtor was insolvent or if the creditor knew that the petition to initiate
insolvency proceedings has been filed.

- Any action benefiting one creditor which he was not entitled to request, or was entitled to request but not
in the manner as, and at the time when, it was provided, may be contested if it was carried out within
twelve months before filing the petition to open insolvency.

Any action directly damaging the debtor’s creditors may be contested if:

- it was entered into within six months before filing for insolvency, if the insolvency debtor was insolvent at
the time and the counterpart knew of its insolvency;

- the transaction was concluded after the filing of the petition aimed at initiating insolvency proceedings, if
the insolvency debtor’s counterpart knew or should have known that the insolvency debtor was insolvent or
that the filing for the opening the insolvency had been made; and

- the debtor’s action results in a waiver of some of its rights or if the failure of the debtor to act results in its
inability to exercise that right and the action was taken or omitted within the last six months before the
filing of the petition to open the insolvency proceeding.

Any transaction entered into or taken within five years before the filing of the petition for initiation of
insolvency proceedings or after that, with the intent to damage one or more creditors, may be contested if the
insolvent debtor’s counterpart knew of the insolvent debtor’s intent. Knowledge of the debtor’s intent is
presumed if the insolvent debtor’s counterpart knew that there was a threat of the insolvent debtor’s
insolvency and that the action would damage the insolvency creditors or that the debtor has received no value
or no adequate value as a consideration for performance of its obligation.

In addition, any security the debtor granted under a loan (or under any other legal action that, in economic
terms, corresponds to a loan) to an affiliate, provided that such affiliate is not regularly engaged in the business
of granting credits or loans, at a time when the debtor was permanently insolvent, or within one year prior to
the opening of insolvency proceedings, has no legal effect in the insolvency proceedings. Also, if a debtor has
repaid a credit or a loan in the year immediately preceding the opening of insolvency proceedings to an
affiliated person which is not regularly engaged in the business of granting credits or loans, the debtor is
deemed to have deliberately jeopardized creditors and such repayment may be contested as an intentional
damaging of creditors.

The court order on the opening of insolvency proceedings has certain consequences. For example, insolvency
creditors may satisfy their claims against the debtor only in insolvency proceedings. Undue claims against the
insolvency debtor are deemed due as of the date of opening of the insolvency. All judicial proceedings against
the insolvent debtor and its assets and all administrative proceedings initiated at the request of the insolvent
debtor and the administrative and tax proceedings aimed at establishing a pecuniary obligation on the
insolvent debtor are suspended and resume only after the fulfillment of certain conditions. No enforcement
proceedings may be conducted against the debtor or its assets for the purpose of settling the claims, except for
the enforcement of liabilities of the insolvency estate and expenses of the insolvency proceedings. Enforcement
ban can be temporarily lifted for a period of nine months in favor of secured creditors in certain cases, in
order to allow them to enforce their claims through the sale of the collateral. The initiation of insolvency
proceedings does not result in automatic termination of contracts; but the insolvency administrator may
choose to terminate certain executory contracts to avoid the worsening of the financial condition of the
company.

**_Creation, Perfection, Amendment and Enforcement of Pledge on Ownership Stakes in Limited Liability_**
**_Company_**

The Secured Transactions Act provides that a pledgee shall acquire the right of pledge by registration in the
Pledge Registry (Registar založnog prava) kept with the Serbian Agency for Commercial Registers (Agencija
_za privredne registre) (the “Pledge Registry”) . Registration is performed on the basis of a (Stakes) Pledge_
Agreement. The (Stakes) Pledge Agreements must be made in writing. In case of pledge over stakes (i.e.,
share(s) in limited liability company), the (Stakes) Pledge Agreement also has to be notarized by a notary
public.

Material amendments to the obligation secured by the (stake) pledge (e.g., legal basis, principal amount, term,
interest rate) require amendments to and registration with the competent authorities of a security document


-----

(e.g., (Stakes) Pledge Agreement). Under the Secured Transactions Act, any amendment to a security
document (e.g., (Stakes) Pledge Agreement) which would alter essential elements of the relevant collateral
would affect such collateral, i.e., it would be considered as new collateral and therefore would have the priority
as of the day of inscription of such alteration in the Pledge Registry (thus giving rise to a new hardening
period), and ranking lower than the collateral registered before the amendments. There is no consistency in
the practice of the Serbian courts or the Pledge Registry as to which elements of the security documents
should be considered essential elements, but these are generally considered to include the legal basis, principal
amount, term and interest rate.

Enforcement proceedings may be commenced in court or, if so expressly provided for in the pledge agreement
(i.e., (Stakes) Pledge Agreement), out of court (in accordance with the terms and conditions imposed by the
law). In case of judicial enforcement, the enforcement title is the relevant excerpt from the competent Pledge
Registry and the stakes (i.e., share(s) in limited liability company) can be sold via public auction (direct sale is
possible only if the collateral has a current market price, in the case of multiple failure of auction sale or in
case the enforcement debtor and enforcement creditor agree so). When enforcement is pursued out of court
(when this is permitted by the pledge agreement), the title for enforcement is the relevant excerpt from the
Pledge Registry, the stakes can be sold at public auction and in direct sale only if its current market price can
be established (unlikely to be the case with the stakes (i.e., share(s) in limited liability company). If the collateral
does not have a current market price (as the stakes (i.e., share(s) in limited liability company)), the pledgee can
sell it in a manner a reasonable and careful man taking care of the interests of the debtor (and the pledgor, if
not the same party as the debtor) would employ.

**Bosnia and Herzegovina**

Telemach BH is a company organized in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“FBiH”), which is one
of the two entities of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Accordingly, the following discussion is limited to the relevant
laws and regulations applicable in FBiH.

Pursuant to the Foreign Exchange Act of FBiH (“FBiH FX Act”), cross border payments from and to FBiH
are permitted if made in accordance with that law. The FBiH FX Act and related bylaws refer only to the
guarantees and security that a Bosnian resident grants for the debt of a non-resident to another non-resident
only if granted under a so-called “credit transaction.”Credit transactions between residents and non-residents,
according to the FBiH FX Act, comprise credits and loans, whereas “credit transactions” between nonresidents are not specified or separately defined. Transactions with debt and equity securities are a separate
category under the FBiH FX Act. It is unlikely that the narrow definition of cross-border guarantees/security
under the FBiH FX Act would be interpreted by the competent FBiH authority to mean that guarantee/
security in support of foreign debt originating under bonds could be regarded as prohibited or as contrary to
public policy of FBiH, because the FBiH FX Act allows granting of guarantees/security in economically
equivalent situations (loans between non-residents). Nonetheless, the issue has not been formally clarified by
the competent FBiH authority.

Any guarantee or other security granted by a FBiH resident in favor of a non-resident must be registered with
the Ministry of Finance of FBiH. The registration application must be made (i) within 15-days from the
decision on the issuance of the guarantee is passed by the relevant body of the guarantor if the underlying
transaction is concluded between two non-resident entities, or (ii) within 15-days from the date of execution
of the underlying transaction documents if concluded between a resident and a non-resident entity.

If the underlying transaction is concluded between two non-residents, periodic reports on the status of the
guarantee must be provided to the Ministry of Finance of FBiH.

In addition, any company based in FBiH that issues a guarantee or provides other security to a non-resident
must obtain from non-resident a security instrument that hedges the risk of the guarantee being called. The
FBiH FX Act does not contain any further details regarding such a security instrument. Nonetheless, the
counter-guarantee instrument is scrutinized by the Ministry of Finance of FBiH, which typically requests
presentation of a proof of a liquid security instrument and employs wide discretion when assessing and
approving counter-guarantees. The Ministry’s restrictive practice is continually evolving, and varies on a caseby-case basis. Pursuant to article 7(2) of the FBiH FX Act, a commercial bank is prohibited to perform a
payment order and from wiring funds abroad if such payment or transfer is in violation of the law, subject to
administrative fines. In this context, there is a theoretical risk that a local bank might reject making relevant
payments outside Bosnia and Herzegovina without proof that the cross-border guarantee has been approved
by the Ministry of Finance of FBiH.


-----

**_Limitations Related to Financial Assistance and Corporate Benefit Rules_**

Certain corporate law limitations stem from the general prohibitions on financial assistance and capital
maintenance rules under the Companies Act of FBiH. According to the Companies Act of FBiH, a limited
liability company is prohibited from giving loans or providing securities/guarantees for the acquisition of its
own shares.

The scope of this prohibition of financial assistance is not entirely clear when it comes to its application to the
company’s indirect shareholders or to the acquisition of shares of one the company’s direct or indirect
shareholders. There are no precedents and therefore some risk remains that the courts could adopt an extensive
interpretation of the provision.

There is no explicit corporate benefit rule in the context of granting security for the obligations of third
parties. However, under the general rules of the Companies Act of FBiH, the management is obliged to act in
the company’s best interest and is liable for damages to the company and the shareholders in case of a breach
of this duty.

Upstream or cross stream guarantee/security may be potentially open to a challenge by way of an actio
_pauliana. The rules on action pauliana, found in the Obligations Act, provide that a creditor having a due_
claim may file a lawsuit for avoidance of a transaction undertaken by its debtor, as far as the effects of that
transaction on the creditor are concerned, if the transaction is deemed to be to the detriment of the challenging
creditor, i.e. if as a result of such a transaction the debtor does not have enough assets to satisfy the creditor’s
claim. The court practice concerning the foregoing in the context of third-party guarantees/security and
corporate benefit, capital maintenance and financial assistance concepts is undeveloped in FBiH.

Theoretically, a third-party guarantee/security given for no consideration can also be challenged for lack of
causa (commercial reason underlying the transaction).

**_Other Noteworthy Procedural Points Regarding Guarantees/Securities_**

To secure priority for a pledge and its judicial enforcement, a registration with the Pledges Registry, which is
maintained by the Ministry of Justice of Bosnia and Herzegovina, should be performed based on a written
pledge agreement.

In addition, it should be noted that the Parallel Debt concept has not been tested under the laws of Bosnia
and Herzegovina. Theoretically, the concept can be challenged as simulated contract or for lack of causa.
However, a more compelling argument seems to be that if a Parallel Debt concept is enforceable under the law
governing the financing documentation, there is no public policy norm of FBiH law that should be able to
override this.

In Bosnia and Herzegovina there is no comparable structure to the common law trust, due to the principle of
accessority where a security may only be validly created in favour of the creditor(s) holding the secured claims
The issue is typically solved through the appointment of a security agent, acting as a joint and several creditor
(solidarni povjerilac) of each and every obligation of the borrower towards each creditor and/or by employing
a Parallel Debt concept. However, the respective structures have not yet been tested before Bosnia and
Herzegovina courts, although they are commonly used in cross-border financings.

_Pledge Registry Software Platform Deficiencies_

The software of the Pledge Registry does not technically enable pledge registration with the pledgor being a
foreign (i.e., non-Bosnian) entity. The web platform for pledge registration technically allows only a Bosnian
domiciled pledgor to be recorded. The perfection (i.e., registration) of a share pledge over a Bosnian
company’s shares by a non-resident shareholder is therefore practically unavailable and may only be effected
with the intentional incorrect inscription of the country of origin of the pledgor (i.e., only by selecting the
item “Bosnia and Herzegovina” from the dropdown menu). In practice the parties often opt to conclude the
share pledge agreement in a form of notarial deed (notarski obrađena isprava) that constitutes an enforceable
instrument (izvršna isprava). Even so, execution of the share pledge agreement in the form of a notarial deed
does not constitute the pledge over the shares of the company, but only a pledge in respect of the enforceable
deed. In an insolvency scenario, this would mean that such a creditor would not qualify as a secured creditor
(razlučni povjerilac).

**_Enforcement Proceedings_**

Enforcement proceedings are regulated by the Enforcement Proceedings Act of FBiH.


-----

According to the Enforcement Proceedings Act, enforcement procedures over property in Bosnia and
Herzegovina may be commenced only upon obtaining a valid enforcement title which may be, inter alia, in the
form of a notarized agreement. A certificate of registration of the pledge issued by the Pledge Registry is
deemed to be an enforcement title, as well.

**_Overview of the Procedure_**

The procedure starts with a creditor filing an enforcement motion. The enforcement motion must include
information about the enforcement title and the relevant debtor’s assets that are targeted by the procedure.
Upon filing the enforcement motion the court has eight days to decide on the motion; however, in practice
this deadline is usually extended. If the court considers the motion admissible and justified, it will grant allow
enforcement on the basis of a decision on enforcement. The enforcement creditor and the enforcement debtor
may object to the court’s decision within eight days from its receipt. If one of the parties files an objection, the
other party has three days to submit its response.

Upon receipt of the response or the expiration of the three-day period without a response being submitted,
the court may decide on the matter or schedule a hearing. The court decides whether the objection is granted
or denied or whether it is refused as untimely, incomplete or inadmissible. If the court accepts the objection it
dismisses the enforcement completely or partially and revokes the enforcement actions that have previously
been conducted. The parties have a right to appeal the court’s decision on the objection within eight days from
its receipt, under certain circumstances enumerated in the law. Objections and appeals do not suspend the
enforcement proceedings, however, the settlement of debt, if pending, is postponed until the court decides on
the objection except when enforcement is on debtor’s transactional bank accounts which may continue.

**_Costs of the Procedure_**

According to the Enforcement Proceedings Act, a creditor who applies for enforcement must pay the estimated
costs required for the enforcement proceedings in advance and do so within a certain period determined by
the court. The court will suspend the enforcement proceedings if the costs are not paid within that period. If
an enforcement act depends on the costs being paid in advance and the payment is not made before that date,
the relevant enforcement act may not be carried out. The enforcement debtor must compensate the creditor
for the costs incurred by it that are necessary to carry out the enforcement and the enforcement creditor must
compensate the debtor for any costs it has caused unnecessarily.

**_Enforcement Procedures in Relation to Pledges_**

Enforcement of pledge pursuant to Framework Pledge Act of BiH is initiated by the pledgee upon a breach of
the pledge agreement by the pledgor. The pledgee must present the pledge contract and the certificate of
registration to the competent court. The certificate of registration is the enforcement title, provided that the
contents of the registration fully correspond to the contents of the pledge agreement. Upon filing the
enforcement motion the court has eight days to decide on the motion. In its enforcement motion the creditor
may request either that the court bailiff takes the collateral from the pledgee and sells it or that the court bailiff
seizes the security from the debtor and sells it. If the creditor submits a motion proposing the latter, the court
bailiff is required to seize the collateral within eight days from the issuance of the court’s decision and then to
sell it.

**_Certain Insolvency Law Considerations_**

As of July 2021, the new Insolvency Act provides for a pre-insolvency restructuring process called “preinsolvency procedure” (predstečajni postupak). This pre-insolvency currently exists in addition to the
traditional restructuring process and as a part of the insolvency procedure, and similarly to the insolvency
procedure, its main steps must be sanctioned by a court. The pre-insolvency procedure under the Insolvency
Act may be applied when there is a “threatening illiquidity” (prijeteća platežna nesposobnost), but where the
debtor is still not insolvent. The threatening illiquidity is defined as a forecast that the debtor will not be able
to satisfy its debt in accordance with its due repayment plan in the following 12 months or if the debtor is in
a 60-days default with respect to the fulfillment of its monetary obligations. The debtor or the creditor (with
the debtor’s consent) can file an application for the initiation of insolvency proceedings on this ground.

Additionally, there are two main reasons for initiating insolvency proceedings—insolvency and threatened
insolvency. In general, a debtor is insolvent if (a) it is unable to settle its due obligations for a period of
60 consecutive days, or (b) its bank accounts are blocked for a period of 60 consecutive days.


-----

Insolvency proceedings are initiated upon a written petition of an authorized person. Authorized persons
include the debtor and all creditors who have a legally recognized interest in the conduct of the proceedings.
The creditor is required to demonstrate, by attaching appropriate documentation, that its claim and the
inability of the debtor to make payments is probable. Only the insolvency debtor is entitled to initiate
insolvency proceedings due to threatened insolvency.

Insolvency proceedings are generally conducted in two phases, a preliminary phase and the insolvency
proceedings themselves. The preliminary procedure is conducted by the insolvency court, which can also
appoint an interim insolvency administrator. The main purpose of the preliminary procedure is to determine
in principle whether the conditions for the opening insolvency are satisfied, i.e. whether any of the insolvency
grounds exist, whether there is a sufficient basis for the petition, whether there are sufficient funds to cover the
costs of the insolvency proceedings and whether the current operations can be maintained and continued
without detriment to the debtor, potential insolvency estate and/or creditors. The insolvency proceedings,
once opened, are conducted by the insolvency administrator appointed by the court and insolvency judge. An
alternative to these two-step proceedings is direct bankruptcy, in cases where (i) a petition is filed by the
company’s liquidator or (ii) a creditor files an insolvency petition supported by a final and binding decision
on enforcement that is not satisfied for a period of at least 90 days.

The general effects of the opening of insolvency proceedings include a stay of pending court and arbitral
proceedings involving the insolvency estate, and pro rata satisfaction of creditors upon sale of the debtor’s
assets by the administrator, in accordance with their payment ranks. Creditors with a separate satisfaction
right (mortgagees, pledgees, creditors to which the debtor transferred rights as security, creditors with
retention rights) have payment priority in insolvency proceedings and have the right to separate settlement
from the proceeds of the asset serving as collateral.

Only the insolvency administrator is authorized to dispose of the debtor’s assets and any disposal by the
insolvency debtor is without legal effect, except in the case of disposals to which general rules of legitimate
reliance on land registers or other appropriate public registers apply.

As of the date of the opening of insolvency proceedings, all bank accounts are closed and the insolvency
administrator opens a new bank account onto which all insolvency debtor’s funds from the closed accounts
are transferred. There is no provision ensuring that the pledge on closed bank accounts transfers onto the new
bank account.

Guarantees and other security for third-party debt provided within a certain period preceding the opening of
the insolvency proceedings may be challenged if they can be considered as giving preference to certain
creditors, as follows:

- guarantees and security given within the period of 12 months prior to the submission of the petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings, if at that time the debtor was insolvent or the creditor knew of such
insolvency or did not know due to gross negligence;

- guarantees and security given after the submission of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings
if the creditor knew of the debtor’s insolvency or the motion for the opening of the insolvency proceedings
at the time or did not know due to gross negligence;

- guarantees and security given in the 90-days preceding the petition or after the submission thereof; and

- guarantees and security given within the six months preceding the petition for the opening of the insolvency
proceedings if the debtor was insolvent at such time.

If the creditor is a related party, the awareness of the debtor’s insolvency is presumed. In addition, loans
granted in substitution to capital contributions are subordinated to all other claims during the insolvency
proceedings. Capital replacing loans are defined as loans that are granted at a critical time for the company,
when the company’s shareholders could have been reasonably expected to contribute capital to the company,
rather than grant loans. This also includes other legally binding transactions that are economically equivalent
to loan.

Granting of security for the claim of a company’s shareholder for repayment of a loan (or an equivalent
thereof) given at the time when capital contribution should have been provided is voidable if the transaction
took place within five years immediately preceding the opening of insolvency proceedings or after the petition.

A legally binding transaction settling the claim of a company’s shareholder for repayment of a loan or
economically equivalent transaction is voidable if the transaction took place in the three years preceding the
opening of proceedings or after the petition. It is unclear whether the loans which fall under this provision are


-----

only those given by the direct shareholder or also include loans by indirect shareholders or affiliates controlled
by (in)direct shareholders and there is no relevant court practice.

**_Law on Financial Dealings considerations_**

Pursuant to the Financial Dealings Act of FBiH, if illiquidity occurs (as defined under that law), the company
cannot execute any payments except those necessary in the ordinary course of business and those aimed at
restoring liquidity. The following are deemed payments in the ordinary course of business:

(a) procurement of goods and services for ordinary business activities;

(b) operational costs of business (energy, water and similar);

(c) salaries of workers;

(d) VAT, excise duties, social contributions and other taxes that have to be calculated and paid in accordance
with the law;

(e) costs related to procedures before public bodies; and

(f) costs related to documentation needed for commencement and implementation of financial consolidation
and restructuring activities.

In addition, the Financial Dealings Act prescribes that a company cannot perform any activity that may
damage creditors or put certain creditors into unfavorable position, in particular:

- diverting cash payments or financial flows to other persons;

- lending;

- distributing dividends, profits or payment of profits in advance;

- transferring rights to third parties, and especially to related companies; and

- procuring automobiles or spare parts for such vehicles, payments for business entertainment,
accommodation expenses and similar.

Accordingly, a company affected by illiquidity cannot make payments under a guarantee while that situation
is pending.

In addition, pursuant to the Financial Dealings Act, companies are obliged to maintain capital adequacy.
Capital inadequacy exists if as of the date of the relevant financial statements, losses, including losses carried
forward from earlier financial years, amount to at least 1/2 of the registered capital. In case of capital
inadequacy, the management of the company is obliged to implement measures intended for restoring capital
adequacy within its competence, such as finding adequate sources of financing, as well as convening a
shareholders assembly and proposing to shareholders to take measures within its competence (such as, e.g.
reducing registered capital to cover losses).

**Luxembourg**

**_Luxembourg Insolvency Considerations_**

Pursuant to Luxembourg insolvency laws, your ability to receive payment under the New Notes may be more
limited than would be the case under U.S. bankruptcy laws. Under Luxembourg law, the following types of
proceedings (together referred to as insolvency proceedings) may be initiated against a company incorporated
in Luxembourg having its centre of main interests (within the meaning of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation) or
an establishment in Luxembourg (in the latter case assuming that the centre of main interests is located in a
jurisdiction where the E.U. Insolvency Regulation is applicable):

- bankruptcy proceedings (faillite), the opening of which may be requested by the company, by any of its
creditors or by the courts ex officio. Following such a request, the Luxembourg courts having jurisdiction
may open bankruptcy proceedings if a Luxembourg company: (i) is in a state of cessation of payments
(cessation des paiements); and (ii) has lost its commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit). The main
effect of such proceedings is the sale of the assets and allocation of the proceeds of such sale between
creditors taking into account their rank of privilege, as well as the suspension of all measures of enforcement
against the company, except, subject to certain limited exceptions (please see the below applicable provision
of the Luxembourg law dated August 5, 2005 concerning financial collateral arrangements, as amended

(the “Financial Collateral Law 2005”)), for enforcement by secured creditors and the payment of the secured
creditors in accordance with their rank upon realization of the assets. In addition, the managers or directors
of a Luxembourg company that ceases its payments (i.e. is unable to pay its debts as they fall due with
normal means of payment) must within a month of them having become aware of the company’s cessation
of payments, file a petition for bankruptcy (faillite) with the court clerk of the district court of the
company’s registered office. A law of December 19, 2020 (amended on June 30, 2021) has suspended this
one month delay until December 31, 2021. If the managers or directors fail to comply with such provision
they may be held (i) liable towards the company or any third parties on the basis of principles of managers’
/ directors’liability for any loss suffered and (ii) criminally liable for simple bankruptcy (banqueroute simple)
in accordance with article 574 of the Luxembourg commercial code.

- controlled management proceedings (gestion contrôlée), the opening of which may only be requested by the
company and not by its creditors and under which a Luxembourg court may order the provisional stay of
enforcement of claims except for secured creditors (please see the below applicable provision of the
Financial Collateral Law 2005); or

- composition proceedings (concordat préventif de la faillite), the opening of which may only be requested by
the company and not by its creditors directly. The Luxembourg court’s decision to admit a company to
composition proceedings triggers a provisional stay on enforcement of claims by creditors except, among
others, for secured creditors (please see the below applicable provisions of the Financial Collateral Law
2005).

- In addition to these proceedings, your ability to receive payment on the New Notes may be affected by a
decision of a Luxembourg court to grant a stay on payments (sursis de paiement) or to put a Luxembourg
company into judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire). Judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at
the request of the public prosecutor against companies pursuing an activity violating criminal laws or that
are in serious breach or violation of the Luxembourg commercial code or of the Law 1915. The
management of such liquidation proceedings will generally follow similar rules as those applicable to
Luxembourg bankruptcy proceedings.

Liability of any of the Guarantors existing under the laws of Luxembourg in respect of the relevant Notes
will, in the event of a liquidation of the company following bankruptcy or judicial liquidation proceedings,
only rank after the cost of liquidation (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and
any claims that are preferred under Luxembourg law. Preferential claims under Luxembourg law include,
among others:

- remuneration owed to employees (last six months’ wages amounting to a maximum of six times the
minimum social salary);

- employees’ contributions to social security;

- certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg Revenue;

- employer’s contribution to social security;

- landlord, pledgor not under the Financial Collateral Law 2005; and

- value added tax and other taxes and duties owed to Luxembourg Customs and Excise.

Assets over which a security interest has been granted will in principle not be available for distribution to
unsecured and unpreferred creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is realized).

Favorable rules apply in relation to security interests of claims or financial instruments securing monetary
claims (or claims for the delivery of financial instruments) pursuant to the Financial Collateral Law 2005.
Article 20 of the Financial Collateral Law 2005 provides that Luxembourg law financial collateral
arrangements (pledges, security assignments and repo agreements) over claims and financial instruments, as
well as valuation and enforcement measures agreed upon by the parties are valid and enforceable even if
entered into during the pre-bankruptcy preference period (période suspecte) against third parties,
commissioners, receivers, liquidators and other similar persons notwithstanding the insolvency proceedings
(save in the case of fraud).

Article 24 of the Financial Collateral Law 2005 provides that foreign law security interests over claims or
financial instruments granted by a Luxembourg pledgor will be valid and enforceable as a matter of
Luxembourg law notwithstanding any Luxembourg insolvency proceedings, if such foreign law security
interests are similar in nature to a Luxembourg security interest falling within the scope of the Financial
Collateral Law 2005. If article 24 applies, Luxembourg preference period rules are disapplied (save the case of
fraud).


-----

Article 21(2) of the Financial Collateral Law 2005 provides that where a financial collateral arrangement has
been entered into after the opening of liquidation proceedings or the coming into force of reorganization
measures or the entry into force of such measures, such arrangement is enforceable against third parties,
administrators, insolvency receivers, liquidators and other similar persons if the collateral taker proves that it
was unaware of the fact that such proceedings had been opened or that such measures had been taken or that
it could not reasonably be aware of such proceedings, measures or arrangement.

**_Impact of Luxembourg Insolvency Proceedings on Transactions_**

During such insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors are suspended. Other
than as described above, the ability of certain secured creditors to enforce their security interest may also be
limited, in particular in the event of controlled management proceedings expressly providing that the rights of
secured creditors are frozen until a final decision has been taken by a Luxembourg court as to the petition for
controlled management, and may be affected thereafter by a reorganization order given by the court. A
reorganization order requires the prior approval by more than 50% of the creditors representing more than
50% of any of the relevant Guarantor’s liabilities in order to take effect.

Furthermore, you should note that declarations of default and subsequent acceleration (such as acceleration
upon the occurrence of an event of default) may not be enforceable during controlled management
proceedings. However, during such controlled management proceedings a notice of default may still be served.

Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by any of the
relevant Guarantors incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg during the preference period (période
suspecte) which is a maximum of six months preceding the judgment declaring bankruptcy, except that in
certain specific situations the court may set the start of the suspect period at an earlier date. In particular:

- pursuant to article 445 of the Luxembourg code of commerce (Code de commerce), specified transactions
(such as, in particular, the granting of a security interest for antecedent debts save in respect of financial
collateral arrangements within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Law 2005; payment of debts which
have not fallen due, whether payment is made in cash or by way of assignment, sale, set-off or by any other
means; the payment of debts which have fallen due by any means other than in cash or by bill of exchange;
the sale of assets without consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration) entered into during
the preference period (or the ten days preceding it) must be set aside or declared null and void, if so
requested by the insolvency receiver;

- pursuant to article 446 of the Luxembourg code of commerce, payments made for matured debts as well as
other transactions concluded for consideration during the preference period are subject to cancellation by
the court upon proceedings instituted by the insolvency receiver if they were concluded with the knowledge
of the bankrupt party’s cessation of payments; and

- pursuant to article 448 of the Luxembourg code of commerce and article 1167 of the Luxembourg civil
code (action paulienne), the insolvency receiver (acting on behalf of the creditors) has the right to challenge
any fraudulent payments and transactions, including the granting of security with an intent to defraud,
made prior to the bankruptcy, without any time limit.

In principle, a bankruptcy order rendered by a Luxembourg court does not result in the automatic termination
of contracts except for employment agreements and powers of attorney. The contracts, therefore, subsist after
the bankruptcy order. However, the bankruptcy receiver may choose to terminate certain contracts so as to
avoid worsening the financial situation of the company. As of the date of adjudication of bankruptcy, no
interest on any unsecured claim will accrue vis à vis the bankruptcy estate. Insolvency proceedings may hence
have a material adverse effect on any of the relevant Guarantors’ business and assets and the relevant
Guarantors’ respective obligations under the New Notes.

Finally, international aspects of Luxembourg bankruptcy, controlled management or composition
proceedings may be subject to the E.U. Insolvency Regulation. In particular, rights in rem over assets located
in another jurisdiction where the E.U. Insolvency Regulation will not be affected by the opening of insolvency
proceedings, without prejudice however to the applicability of rules relating to the voidness, voidability or
unenforceability of legal acts detrimental to all the creditors (subject to the application of article 24 of the
Financial Collateral Law 2005 as described above and article 16 of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation).

**_Luxembourg Law Collateral Considerations_**

Under Luxembourg law, contracts are in principle formed by the mere agreement (consentement) between the
parties thereto. However, additional steps are required to enforce security interests against third parties.


-----

If there are assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, the security interests over such assets will
be governed by Luxembourg law and must be created, perfected and enforced in accordance with Luxembourg
law. The Financial Collateral Law 2005 governs the creation, validity, perfection and enforcement of pledges
over securities, bank account balances and receivables located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg.

Security interests such as pledges, and transfer of ownership as a security, granted on financial instruments
and claims are governed by the Financial Collateral Law 2005. Pursuant to such law, pledge is effected, not by
transfer of title, but by a transfer of possession of the pledged assets to the pledgor or to a third-party acting
as depository for the pledgor and the pledgor’s preference rights over the pledged assets only remain in
existence as long as the pledgor or the depository remains in possession of such assets.

A physical transfer of possession not being possible for intangibles such as monetary claims, the Financial
Collateral Law 2005 provides for a fictitious transfer of possession which is effected by mechanisms which
depend on the nature of the intangibles involved. In case of registered shares, the dispossession is achieved by
the entry of the security interest in the share register of the relevant Luxembourg company. In case of claims,
dispossession is effected as against the debtor and any third parties by the execution of the relevant pledge
agreement. Nonetheless, the debtor of a pledged claim may validly discharge its obligation by performance
rendered to the pledgor as long as it has no knowledge of the pledge. Dispossession of cash collateral is
achieved by the security interest thereon being notified by the debtor and the acceptance thereof by the
debtor of such claims.

Absent perfection, the holder of the security interest may have difficulty enforcing his/its rights in the collateral
with regard to third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest
in the same collateral. Finally, since the ranking of pledges is determined by the date on which they became
enforceable against third parties, a security interest created on a later date over the same collateral, but which
come into force for third parties earlier (by way of registration in the appropriate register or by notification)
has priority.

**_Luxembourg Guarantee Considerations_**

The Law 1915 does not provide for rules governing the ability of a Luxembourg company to guarantee the
indebtedness of another entity of the same group. A company may give a guarantee provided the giving of the
guarantee is covered by the company’s corporate purpose, corporate benefit and is in the best interest of the
company. Although no statutory definition of corporate benefit (intérêt social) exists under Luxembourg law,
corporate benefit is widely interpreted and includes any transactions from which the company derives a direct
or indirect economic or commercial benefit in return (such as an economic or commercial benefit) and whether
the benefit is proportionate to the burden of the assistance. It is generally held that within a group of
companies, the corporate interest of each individual corporate entity can include, to a certain extent, the
interest of the group, and that the existence of a group interest can in certain cases result in the guarantee
being held enforceable even where corporate benefit is not established. In this way, reciprocal assistance from
one group company to another does not necessarily conflict with the interest of the assisting company.
However, this assistance must be temporary, in proportion to the real financial means of the assisting company
(i.e., limited to an aggregate amount not exceeding the assisting company’s own funds (capitaux propres)), the
company must receive some benefit or there must be a balance between the respective commitments of all the
affiliates and the companies involved must form part of a genuine group operating under a common strategy
aimed at a common objective. As a result, the guarantees/security interests granted by a Luxembourg company
may be subject to limitations in order to ensure their enforceability. Further, a guarantee or security interest
that substantially exceeds the guarantor’s or security provider’s ability to meet its obligations to the beneficiary
of the guarantee/security provider and to its other creditors, or from which the Luxembourg company derives
no or very limited direct benefit in return, or where no direct or indirect consideration is granted to the
company in exchange, would expose its directors or managers to personal liability. In addition to any criminal
and civil liability incurred by the directors or managers of the Luxembourg company, in extreme circumstances
the guarantee or security interest could itself be held unenforceable, if it is held that it is contrary to public
policy (ordre public), in the case of facts consisting of a misuse of corporate assets. Any guarantee granted in
connection with the New Notes by Luxembourg companies may be limited to a certain percentage of, among
others, the relevant company’s net worth. The Indenture provides for general limitation language to the effect
that each guarantee granted therein and each security interest granted as well as any other obligation, liability
or indemnification under a security document will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed/
secured by the relevant guarantor/security provider with respect to the aggregate obligations and exposure of
the guarantor/security provider without rendering the relevant guarantee/security interest voidable or
otherwise ineffective under Luxembourg and other applicable law. If one or more of these laws and defenses


-----

are applicable, a Guarantor may have no liability or decreased liability under its guarantee or the security
documents to which it is a party.

**Bulgaria**

**_Overview of limitations_**

The validity, binding effect and enforceability of guarantees/security interests granted by Bulgarian guarantors
may be limited or otherwise be affected by the applicable stabilization or insolvency proceedings against the
Bulgarian guarantors, avoidance or similar laws of general application relating to or affecting the enforcement
of creditors’ rights and remedies, as well as financial assistance prohibitions. These are reviewed in turn below.

**_Stabilization Proceedings_**

As of 2017 Bulgarian law also provides for a pre-insolvency restructuring procedure called “stabilization
procedure.” It currently exists as an additional procedure to the traditional restructuring as a part of the
insolvency procedure, and it is similarly to the insolvency procedure a procedure, the main steps in which must
be sanctioned by a court. The stabilization procedure under the Bulgarian Commerce Act may be applied
when there is a “threat of insolvency” but where the debtor is still not insolvent. Actually, all court cases since
the inception of the new procure have been focused on whether the requirements for launching stabilization
were fulfilled and all publicly available judgments so far, the courts held that the debtor was actually insolvent
(in most cases over-indebted), so insolvency rather than stabilization procedure had to be opened. We are not
aware of any case where the new procedure was applied, and the debtor was successfully restructured to avoid
insolvency. In terms of substance, the stabilization procedure provides for a temporary standstill where all
court enforcement and out of court enforcement procedures (including those under special pledges) shall be
stopped. Further there are rules for partial cram down of the debtor’s liabilities. As of the date of this offering
memorandum, Bulgaria has not yet transposed Directive (EU) 2019/1023. Although a draft bill was published
on the webpage of the Bulgarian government on February 26, 2021, the legislative implementation process
that starts with a submission of a draft bill to the Bulgarian Parliament has not yet been commenced. In
addition, since following the parliamentary elections in Bulgaria that took place on April 4, 2021, no
government could be formed, new elections took place on July 11, 2021. The results of the new elections were
similar to those held in April 2021 and therefore there is uncertainty on whether a government will be formed.
As a result, there is a risk that the July 17, 2021 deadline for the implementation of Directive (EU) 2019/1023
in Bulgaria may not be met. However, this Directive is expected to be implemented approximately in the
second half of 2021. The exact timing for such implementation will depend on the formation and stability of
a new government.

**_Insolvency Proceedings_**

Should a Bulgarian guarantor have its “centre of main interests” (which is presumed to be the case due to
their incorporation in Bulgaria, unless something else is proven) they may be subject to Bulgarian insolvency
proceedings.

The insolvency proceedings do not affect out of court enforcement over Bulgarian special pledges, only if the
out of court enforcement was commenced before launching of the insolvency proceedings. Otherwise the
pledgee under a special pledge may only satisfy within the insolvency proceedings having a first-ranking
priority over the insolvency proceeds from the collateral.

A Bulgarian guarantor would be deemed insolvent in any of the following three cases occurs. The first case is
one of balance sheet insolvency (over indebtedness). When a creditor claims that a debtor is balance sheet
insolvent (as a ground for commencement of insolvency proceedings against the latter) it has to be established
that the debtor’s “liabilities exceed his assets.” All liabilities must be compared to all assets for the purpose.
This includes all existing liabilities including those that are not yet due (e.g. future payments under an existing
contract). Contingent (conditional) liabilities however are not covered. There is no formal requirement that
the negative balance for the purposes of over indebtedness should be substantial and though the dominating
understanding among scholars is that minor negative balance should not be taken into account where the
prospects for the entity are positive, it cannot be ruled out that even a minor negative balance may trigger over
indebtedness. The second case is the one of cash flow insolvency. This means a state of inability to pay: (i) a
monetary obligation under or in relation to a commercial transaction, or (ii) public law obligation towards the
State/municipalities connected with the commercial activity of the entity; or (iii) private law obligation towards
the State/municipalities. So, in the cash flow insolvency scenario a creditor must establish both: (i) the existence
of a particular payment obligation of any of the three types listed above that was due but was not paid


-----

(i.e.—the “First Condition”), and the inability of the debtor to pay (“Second Condition”). The First Condition
involves establishment of only factual matters. The Second Condition however requires again a comparison
between assets and liabilities of the debtor, although in a more limited manner (compared to the over
indebtedness scenario). In particular (according to the case law) in order to determine whether a debtor is
unable to pay, the ratio has to be established between the current/short-term assets (i.e. those that can be easily
turned into cash) vis à vis short-term liabilities (i.e. existing liabilities with a maturity of up to 1 year in the
future). If the ratio is below 1 (meaning that the short-term liabilities exceed the short-term assets), it is
normally presumed that the debtor is unable to pay (i.e. the Second Condition is met). The third case where
insolvency proceedings should be opened is the one of “concealed insolvency.” This means that an entity is
concealing commercial activity behind an insolvent entity, so if that is proven to be case insolvency proceedings
must be opened against the former.

In general, the opening of insolvency proceedings by a Bulgarian court does not result in the automatic
termination of contracts. However, the insolvency administrator may choose to terminate certain contracts as
to avoid the worsening of the financial condition of the company. Any power of attorney terminates upon
initiation of bankruptcy proceedings provided that the insolvency court has established that the debtor
jeopardizes the interests of creditors and that the debtor has been deprived of the right to manage and dispose
of the property of the company.

Insolvency proceedings may therefore have a material adverse effect on the relevant Vivacom Guarantor’s
business and assets and the Vivacom Guarantor’s respective obligations with respect to the New Notes.

**_Avoidance Claims_**

Within the insolvency proceedings certain Bulgarian avoidance rule may have to be considered. The general
claim that creditors may take recourse to, even if there is no insolvency is Actio Pauliana (павлов иск) under
art. 135 of the Obligations and Contracts Act. Under that claim a creditor may request that any act of the
Bulgarian guarantor/security provider having a detrimental effect on the creditor be declared void as against
the creditor, provided that the Bulgarian guarantor/security provider knew about that detrimental effect at the
time of performing the act. In the context of non-gratuitous acts, the plaintiff (creditor) must furthermore
prove that counterparty (creditor) to the Bulgarian guarantor/security provider also knew about the
detrimental effect of the challenged act on other creditors. This means proof that both the Bulgarian
guarantor/security provider and its counterparty knew there were other creditors having valid claims existing
before the challenged act and the act in question was detrimental to them. Pure knowledge is sufficient, it is
not necessary to prove that there was intention to inflict detrimental effect on the other creditors. However, if
the parties intend to defraud the other creditors it is not necessary as a prerequisite for the Actio Pauliana that
the respective creditor’s claim should have arisen before the challenged act. The detrimental effect for the
purposes of Actio Pauliana exists if the possibility for the creditor to satisfy himself from the Bulgarian
guarantor/security provider’s property is reduced, which means that via the challenged act created or increased
its state of inability to pay to other creditors.

In addition (subject to some technical exceptions) the following acts and transactions may be declared null
and void with respect to the insolvency creditors if made by the Bulgarian guarantor/security provider after
the initial date of insolvency or over indebtedness and cumulatively—within the timelines—under the
following items (i) (iii) before the submission of the application for opening of insolvency proceedings:
(i) performance of a monetary obligation that was not yet due (неизискуемо) regardless of the manner of
performance made within a one year period; (ii) performance of a monetary obligation that was due
(изискуемо) regardless of the manner of performance made within a six month period; and (iii) establishing
a pledge, mortgage or personal security (i.e. a guarantee) to secure a previously not secured obligation made
within a two year period.

In addition to other general statutory rules providing for setting aside of certain acts and transactions, the
following acts and transactions carried out by the debtor (within the timeline under items 1 3 below) before
the submission of the application for opening of insolvency proceedings may be set aside with respect to the
insolvency creditors: (i) establishment of a mortgage, pledge or personal security for another person’s debts,
effected within one year, but not earlier than the date of the insolvency or over indebtedness, as the case may
be; (ii) establishment of a mortgage, pledge or personal security for another person’s debts to the benefit of a
creditor, which is a related party to the debtor, effected within two years; (iii) a transaction that is detrimental
to the creditors, a party to which is a person related to the debtor, effected within two years; (iv) a transaction
where the consideration provided by the insolvent Bulgarian guarantor/security provider exceeds significantly
the consideration granted by its counterparty, effected within 2 years period before the submission of the
application for opening of insolvency proceedings but not earlier than the date when the Bulgarian guarantor/


-----

security provider was in a state of inability to pay or over indebtedness; (v) gratuitous transaction made
within a two year period (resp. three years if made to a related person).

Lastly, the following shall be considered null and void (in accordance with art. 646, par. 1 of the Bulgarian
Commerce Act (Търговски закон)) with respect to the insolvency creditors if carried out after the date of the
decision on opening of insolvency proceedings and in violation of the insolvency procedures: (i) performance
of an obligation that had occurred prior to the date of the decision on opening of insolvency proceedings;
(ii) establishing a pledge, or mortgage; (iii) transactions with rights or properties from the insolvency estate.

**_Limitations with respect to corporate benefit_**

Bulgarian law does not explicitly require the existence of a corporate benefit upon the grant of security for a
third-party debt. However, the grant of the SSN Guarantees and the security interests by the Vivacom SSN
Guarantors without benefit or obvious rationale for the Vivacom SSN Guarantors may be interpreted as an
act with a detrimental effect and thus subject to certain of the claims set forth in “Avoidance Claims” above,
such as: (i) actio pauliana (Павлов иск) within and outside of insolvency and (ii) insolvency avoidance claims
within insolvency.

**_Limitations to avoid overindebtedness_**

The obligations of the Vivacom SSN Guarantors are further limited to the extent that they result in (i) over
indebtedness (свръхзадлъжнялост) in the meaning of Article 742, paragraph 1 of the Bulgarian Commerce
Act (Търговски закон), promulgated in State Gazette No. 48/18.06.1991, effective July 1, 1991, as amended,
and (ii) a state of immediate threat of insolvency in the sense of Article 762, paragraph 1 (непосредствена
_опасност от неплатежоспособност) of the Bulgarian Commerce Act._

**_Limitations with respect to subordination arrangements_**

The subordination arrangements in the SSN Guarantees assumed by the Vivacom SSN Guarantors (see
“SSN Guarantees” above) may not be enforceable against third parties in case of enforcement proceedings
against the Vivacom SSN Guarantors in Bulgaria. There is still no court judgement in Bulgaria confirming
that the respective public or private bailiff (държавен или частен съдебен изпълнител) or insolvency
administrator (синдик) who would be in charge of the distribution among creditors should in case of such
arrangements disregard the statutory rules on ranking of creditors and apply instead the contractual
subordination arrangements. Certain academic scholars insist that subordination arrangements may not be
binding to any third-party different to those under the contract and would in particular would not bind the
respective public or private bailiff (държавен или частен съдебен изпълнител) or insolvency administrator
(синдик) as the procedural rules for creditors ranking are mandatory in nature.

**_Validity of guarantees in connection with litigation involving the Vivacom Group_**

The validity, binding effect and enforceability of guarantees and security interests granted by the Vivacom
SSN Guarantors may be limited or otherwise be affected by the litigation described in “Our Business—Legal
_Proceedings.”_

**_Use of Security Agent and Parallel Debt_**

Under Bulgarian law, security interests can be granted to a security trustee for the claims of all bondholders
only if the security trustee is a bank. Parallel debt arrangements governed by a foreign system of law are also
often used, mainly for credit agreements where the Bulgarian security trustee concept is not applicable.

We note that parallel debt structures governed by a foreign law under which such arrangements are valid and
enforceable have not yet been tested in Bulgarian courts.

**_Enforcement over Bulgarian Special Pledges—General Rules_**

Under Bulgarian law, depending on the type of security, certain perfection requirements as set forth below
must be satisfied in order for a security to become enforceable.

The following enforcement mechanisms are possible: (i) court execution over dematerialized shares in a joint
stock company (and sale) pursuant to the statutory provisions on execution and securing of claims (for which
a prior writ of execution is required); and (ii) out of court execution over dematerialized shares in a joint stock
company or shares (quotas) in a limited liability company through a private sale, pursuant to the currently


-----

effective legislation and as of January 2022 (unless extensions are introduced), are required to be carried out
under rules involving greater transparency and publicity than the existing rules, whereas the choice between
court or out of court execution is at the sole discretion of the pledgor.

Regarding collateral enforcement in this section only out of court enforcement of non-possessory special
pledges (over going concerns, shares in limited liability companies and joint stock companies) under Bulgarian
law will be considered. The term “out of court” refers to an extra judicial summary procedure for the seizure
and sale of the collateral (i.e., a procedure without court involvement), pursuant to the rules set out in the
Bulgarian Special Pledges Act. Under the Bulgarian Special Pledges Act, such out of court enforcement
(i) does not require a prior Bulgarian, or any other court judgment, arbitral award, writ of execution or other
judicial ruling; (ii) may be undertaken without acceleration of the New Notes for the amount outstanding and
payable under the New Notes at the date of enforcement; and (iii) may be carried out simultaneously,
independently and irrespective of any insolvency proceedings that may be opened with respect to the
Bulgarian guarantor/security provider. This out of court Collateral enforcement is in effect a “fast track”
recovery procedure irrespective of any other pending or contemplated actions or litigation proceedings.

The enforcement starts with a notification of the commencement of out of court pledge enforcement to the
Bulgarian Central Register of Special Pledges or another register depending on the type of collateral by the
Trustee, on behalf and at the direction of holders of the New Notes. This does not require the assistance or
the consent of the respective Bulgarian pledgor. The Trustee shall notify the respective pledgor of the
commencement of the out of court enforcement proceeding, specifying, amongst other information, the
nature of the default, the outstanding amount due and payable, and the collateral subject to sale. This
notification may be served on the pledgee immediately following the notification to the respective register.
Upon service of the above-mentioned notifications to the register and the applicable pledgor the Trustee is
entitled to take possession of the Collateral that is the subject of enforcement. In the event the pledgor refuses
to voluntarily surrender such Collateral, the Trustee may seek the intervention of and engage a bailiff (public
or private enforcement officer) at the expense of the pledgor. On the basis of a certificate from the register
confirming that enforcement has been initiated, such bailiff is entitled to force the pledgor to surrender the
collateral, with police assistance, as necessary. The collateral sale may occur after expiry of a 2 week grace
period from the notification to the register, to enable making voluntary payment before the collateral is sold.
During this grace period, the Trustee may nevertheless organize the collateral sale (take possession of the
collateral, engage the depository (as defined below), identify creditors, and so on). The collateral sale must be
undertaken by and in the name of the Trustee. The Trustee must make reasonable efforts to achieve the best
price for the collateral and there are some specific requirements to publicize the terms of the sale in advance
by registration with the register. The Trustee may engage the pledgee, assuming it is cooperative, as its agent to
manage the actual collateral sale process. The Trustee shall appoint a professional accountant or a bailiff (the
“Depository”) who will administer the proceeds collected from the collateral sale. Amongst other things, the
Depository shall (i) identify the creditors who have rights to the collateral that is subject to enforcement
(“Qualified Creditors”) and notify the Qualified Creditors, who have two weeks to comment, after which the
definitive list of Qualified Creditors is finalized and is not subject to challenge, (ii) open a special purpose
depository bank account in the name of the Depository for the collection of sale proceeds, (iii) provide
information on the contemplated distribution of proceed to the creditor(s) (which will be only the Trustee as
creditor on behalf of the Bondholders), and (iv) if there are no objections or challenges, distribute such
proceeds to the creditors (which will be only the Trustee as creditor on behalf of the Bondholders).

**_Specifics regarding Pledge over Shares in Joint Stock Companies (such as BTC) and Enforcement over such_**
**_Shares_**

Shares in a joint stock company, existing in a dematerialized form (such as the shares in BTC) may be pledged
under the Bulgarian Special Pledges Act. This requires an agreement in writing and registration with the
Bulgarian Central Depository which is the institution in whose databases dematerialized shares exist in a legal
form.

Enforcement over such shares requires respectively that the commencement of enforcement should be
registered with the Central Depository AD. The enforcement may take place by an out of court transfer of the
pledged shares so that the pledgee may satisfy the secured debt directly from its sale proceeds.

**_Specifics regarding Pledge over Shares in Limited Liability Companies (such as Viva Telecom and United_**
**_Group Bulgaria) and Enforcement over such Shares_**

Shares in a limited liability company (such as Viva Telecom and United Group Bulgaria) may be pledged
under the Bulgarian Special Pledges Act. This requires an agreement in writing with notarized signatures and


-----

registration with the Bulgarian Commerce Register. Enforcement over such shares requires respectively that
the commencement of enforcement should be registered with the Bulgarian Commerce Register.

The pledgee will be restricted in its options in case of enforcement only to enforcement through a liquidation
of the company the shares in which are pledged, and the pledgee may satisfy the secured debt only out of the
liquidation quota for the pledgor whose quota, in turn, may only be formed after voluntary liquidation
proceedings. In particular, the general possibility under the Bulgarian Special Pledges Act to sell the pledged
property out of court is inapplicable when it comes to enforcement over shares in a limited liability company.
The attempts of some lawyers nevertheless to effect such an enforcement sale of shares in a limited liability
company are regularly dismissed by the authorities in Bulgaria.

**_Bulgarian Guarantee Considerations_**

Except for bank guarantees, under Bulgarian law there are no provisions regulating abstract guarantees that
are independent of the novation or replacement of the guaranteed debt or of any changes to the creditors and
the debtors under the guaranteed debt. Thus, even if a guarantee is valid under the applicable law, the Vivacom
SSN Guarantors may oppose its validity based on certain Bulgarian law principles claiming that they are
rules of overriding nature that should be applied regardless of the foreign applicable law. Although the
overriding nature of the local rules has been confirmed by court practice with regard to certain of the
limitations set forth below, there is no conclusive case law evidencing that the remaining rules would not be
considered as overriding mandatory rules and/or rules of public policy. Such rules are as follows:

(i) a guarantee will terminate upon novation (including by way of change of the parties or replacement of
the debt) or transfer of the guaranteed debt, unless the relevant Bulgarian guarantor expressly agrees
that the guarantee extends to the novated or transferred obligations;

(ii) a Bulgarian guarantor will not be liable for any increased amount of the guaranteed debt, unless it has
expressly agreed to such liability, and the extension of maturity of the guaranteed debt in relation to the
debtor is not effective in relation to the Bulgarian guarantor, unless the Bulgarian guarantor has expressly
agreed to such extension;

(iii) a Bulgarian guarantor will not remain liable under the guarantee after the due date for repayment of the
debt, unless the creditor has claimed repayment from the principal debtor within six months as of that
repayment date; and

(iv) since under Bulgarian law a guarantee would be considered as an accessory personal security, the waiver
of the right to refer to the personal defenses of the respective debtor as well as to the set-off right of the
respective debtor may not be enforceable under mandatory Bulgarian law and therefore the Bulgarian
guarantor can avail itself of such personal defenses and set-off rights. For the same reason, the valid
existence and the scope of the guarantee depends on the valid existence and the scope of the guaranteed
debt.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Subject to the terms and conditions stated in the purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) dated
, 2021, each Initial Purchaser has severally and not jointly agreed to purchase, together with all other
Initial Purchasers, and the Issuer has agreed to sell to each Initial Purchaser, New Notes in an aggregate
principal amount of €300 million.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery
of the New Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel.

The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the New Notes at the price to investors indicated on the cover page of
this offering memorandum. After the initial offering of the New Notes, the Initial Purchasers may from time
to time vary the offering price and other selling terms without notice. Sales of the New Notes by the Initial
Purchasers in the United States may be made through affiliates of the Initial Purchasers. The offering of the
New Notes by the Initial Purchasers is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the Initial Purchasers’
right to reject any order in whole or in part.

The Issuer has agreed to indemnify the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under
the Securities Act, and will contribute to payments which the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in
respect of any such liabilities. The Issuer will pay the Initial Purchasers a commission and pay certain expenses
of the offering of the New Notes. The Issuer has agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, not to offer, sell,
contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt securities issued by the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries having
a tenor of more than one year (other than the New Notes) during the period from the date of the Purchase
Agreement through and including the date that is 45 days after the date of such Purchase Agreement, without
the prior written consent of the representatives of the Initial Purchasers.

No action has been or will be taken in any jurisdiction by us or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a
public offering of the New Notes or the Guarantees, or the possession, circulation or distribution of this
offering memorandum or any other material relating to the Issuer, the New Notes in any jurisdiction where
action for that purpose is required. Accordingly, the New Notes and the Guarantees may not be offered or
sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this offering memorandum nor any other offering material or
advertisements in connection with the New Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or
jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or
jurisdiction.

This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to sell in any
jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this offering
memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about, and to observe, any restrictions relating to the
offering of the New Notes, the distribution of this offering memorandum and resales of the New Notes. See
“Transfer Restrictions.”

**Market for New Notes**

The Issuer has been advised by the Initial Purchasers that the Initial Purchasers intend to make a market in the
New Notes but are not obligated to do so and may discontinue market making at any time without notice. We
do not intend to apply for listing of the New Notes on any national securities exchange or for inclusion of the
New Notes on any automated dealer quotation system, except that application will be made, through the
Listing Agent, to the Authority for the New Notes to be admitted to the Official List of the Exchange. We
cannot assure you that this application will be approved or that, if approved, such listing will be maintained.
No assurance can be given as to the liquidity of the trading market for the New Notes. If an active trading
market for the New Notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the New Notes may be adversely
affected. If the New Notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending
on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, the Group’s operating performance and financial
condition, general economic conditions and other factors. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the New Notes,
_the Guarantees and the Collateral—There may not be an active trading market for the New Notes, in which case_
_your ability to sell the New Notes may be limited.”_

**Stabilization**

The Stabilizing Manager may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions and covering transactions in
accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering
size, which creates a short position for the Stabilizing Manager. Stabilizing transactions permit bidders to
purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering


-----

transactions involve purchases of the New Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed
in order to cover short positions.

The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time.
Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the New Notes. These
stabilizing transactions and covering transactions may cause the price of the New Notes to be higher than it
would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions.

**Short Positions**

In connection with the offering of the New Notes, the Initial Purchasers may purchase and sell the New Notes
in the open market. These transactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions and purchases to
cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the Stabilizing Manager of a greater
number of Notes than they are required to purchase in the offering of the New Notes. Stabilizing transactions
consist of certain bids or purchases made for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market
price of the New Notes while the offering of the New Notes is in progress.

These activities by the Stabilizing Manager, as well as other purchases by the Initial Purchasers for their own
accounts, may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the New Notes. As a result, the price
of the New Notes may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. If these activities
are commenced, they may be discontinued by the Initial Purchasers at any time. These transactions may be
effected in the over the counter market or otherwise.

Persons who purchase New Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes, and
other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering
price set forth on the cover page hereof.

**Notes are Not Being Registered**

The New Notes (including the Guarantees) have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act
and may not be offered or sold within the United States except to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on
Rule 144A and to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Until 40-days after
the later of (i) the commencement of the Offering and (ii) the Issue Date of the New Notes, an offer or sale of
the New Notes initially sold in reliance on Regulation S within the United States by a dealer (whether or not
participating in the Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or
sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Terms used in this
paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the New Notes are restricted as
described under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it:

- has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of
section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances in
which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or the Guarantors; and

- has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by
it in relation to the New Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

Any offer or sale in the United States will be made by affiliates of the Initial Purchasers who are broker dealers
registered under the Exchange Act.

**Settlement**

The Issuer expects that delivery of the New Notes will be made to investors on or about the date specified on
the cover page of this offering memorandum, which is business days following the date of this offering
memorandum (such settlement being referred to as “T+ ”). Under Rule 15(c)6-1 under the Exchange Act,
trades in the secondary market are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade
expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the New Notes on the date of pricing or
the next succeeding business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the New Notes will initially
settle business days following the date of pricing of the New Notes, to specify an alternative settlement
cycle at the time of such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the New Notes who wish to make
such trades should consult their own advisors.


-----

**Other Relationships**

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory,
investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial
Purchasers and their respective affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform,
various financial advisory and investment banking services for United Group, certain direct and indirect
shareholders of United Group, and their respective affiliates, for which they received or will receive customary
fees and expenses. In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers are arrangers and lenders under the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility, a portion of which will be repaid with the proceeds of the Offering.

In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold
a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and
financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers.
Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and instruments of ours or our affiliates. If
the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, they routinely hedge their credit
exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and
their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase
of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the New Notes
offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the New Notes. The
Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and publish or express
independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend
to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

Funds, limited partnerships or other entities managed by or otherwise advised by the Sponsor or any
independent debt funds or entities managed by or advised by the Sponsor or other affiliates of the Sponsor
may place a purchase order for and be allocated New Notes at a purchase price per New Notes equal to the
applicable issue price set forth on the cover page of this offering memorandum, subject to a pass through or
payment to such persons of the Initial Purchasers’ discount in respect of the New Notes purchased by such
persons. In addition, certain members of our management may purchase a limited amount of the New Notes
offered hereby.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the European Economic Area**

**_MiFID II Product Governance / Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market_**

Solely for the purposes of the manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect
of the New Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the New Notes is eligible
counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution
of the New Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently
offering, selling or recommending the New Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the
manufacturer’s target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for
undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the New Notes (by either adopting or refining the
manufacturer’s target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**_PRIIPs Regulation / Prospectus Regulation / Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors_**

The New Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means
a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer
within the meaning of the Insurance Mediation Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as
defined in the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently no key information document required by the PRIIPs
Regulation for offering or selling the New Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the
EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the New Notes or otherwise making them available
to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation. This offering memorandum
has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any Member State of the EEA will be made pursuant
to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of
the New Notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the United Kingdom**

In the United Kingdom, this offering memorandum is being distributed only to, and is directed only at, and
any offer subsequently made may only be directed at persons who are “qualified investors” (as defined in the


-----

Prospectus Regulation) (i) who have professional experience in matters relating to investments falling within
Article 19 (5) of the Order and/or (ii) who are high net worth companies (or persons to whom it may otherwise
be lawfully communicated) falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) of the Order (all such persons together being
referred to as “relevant persons”). This offering memorandum must not be acted on or relied on in the United
Kingdom by persons who are not relevant persons. In the United Kingdom, any investment or investment
activity to which this offering memorandum relates is only available to, and will be engaged in with, relevant
persons.


-----

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

The following restrictions will apply to the New Notes. You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to
making any offer, resale, pledge or other transfer of any of the New Notes offered hereby.

The New Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws
and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction
not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.
Accordingly, the New Notes offered hereby are being offered and sold only to qualified institutional buyers in
reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in offshore
transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. As used in this section, the terms “United
States,” “U.S. person” and “offshore transaction” have the meanings given to them in Regulation S.
Accordingly, we are offering and selling the New Notes to the Initial Purchasers for re offer and resale only:

- in the United States to “qualified institutional buyers,” commonly referred to as “QIBs,” as defined in
Rule 144A in compliance with Rule 144A; and

- outside the United States in an offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S and, in this case, only
to investors who, if resident in a Member State of the European Economic Area, are not retail investors,
each defined as a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of
MiFiD II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Mediation Directive, where that customer
would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFiD II; or (iii) not a
qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation.

In addition, until 40-days after the later of the commencement of the offering and the closing date, an offer or
sale of the New Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the offering) may
violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than pursuant
to Rule 144A.

Each purchaser of the New Notes, by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged,
represented to and agreed with us and the Initial Purchasers as follows:

(1) It understands and acknowledges that the New Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act
or any other applicable state securities law, and that the New Notes are being offered for resale in
transactions not requiring registration under the Securities Act or any state securities law, including sales
pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S, and may not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred except in
compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act or any applicable state securities law,
pursuant to an exemption therefrom or in any transaction not subject thereto and in each case in
compliance with the conditions for transfer set forth in paragraphs (4) and (5) below.

(2) It is not an “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144) of the Issuer or acting on behalf of the Issuer and it is
either:

(a) a “qualified institutional buyer”as defined in Rule 144A and is aware that any sale of the New Notes
to it will be made in reliance on Rule 144A and the acquisition of the New Notes will be for its own
account or for the account of another qualified institutional buyer; or

(b) not a U.S. person, nor is it buying for the account of a U.S. person, and is purchasing the New Notes
outside the United States in an offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S.

(3) It acknowledges that neither we nor the Initial Purchasers, nor any person representing us or the Initial
Purchasers, has made any representation to it with respect to the offering or sale of any Notes, other than
the information contained in this offering memorandum, which offering memorandum has been delivered
to it and upon which it is relying in making its investment decision with respect to the New Notes. It
acknowledges that neither the Initial Purchasers nor any person representing the Initial Purchasers makes
any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the information contained in this
offering memorandum. It also acknowledges that it has had access to such financial and other
information concerning us and the New Notes as it has deemed necessary in connection with its decision
to purchase any of the New Notes.

(4) It is purchasing the New Notes for its own account, or for one or more investor accounts for which it is
acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in
connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act or any state securities laws,
subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the property of such investor


-----

account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and subject to its or their ability to resell
such Notes pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or any other exemption from registration available
under the Securities Act.

(5) Each holder of the New Notes agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which
it is purchasing the New Notes, and each subsequent holder of the New Notes by its acceptance thereof
will be deemed to agree, to offer, sell or otherwise transfer such New Notes prior to the date (the “Resale
Restriction Termination Date”) that is, in the case of New Notes sold in reliance on Rule 144A, one year
after the later of the date of the Issue Date, the issue date of any additional notes and the last date on
which the Issuer or any of their affiliates was the owner of such respective series of Notes (or any
predecessor thereto), in the case of New Notes sold in reliance on Regulation S, 40-days after the later of
the Issue Date, the issue date of any additional New Notes, and the date on which such respective series
of New Notes (or any predecessor thereto) were first offered to persons other than distributors, only
(i) to the Issuer or any subsidiaries thereof; (ii) pursuant to a registration statement that has been declared
effective under the Securities Act; (iii) for so long as the New Notes are eligible pursuant to Rule 144A
under the Securities Act, to a person it reasonably believes is a qualified institutional buyer that purchases
for its own account or for the account of a qualified institutional buyer to whom notice is given that the
transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act; (iv) pursuant to offshore
transactions to non-U.S. persons occurring outside the United States within the meaning of Regulation S
under the Securities Act and in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act or (v) pursuant to any
other available exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, subject in each of the
foregoing cases to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the property of such
investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and to compliance with any
applicable state securities laws and any applicable local laws and regulations, and further subject to the
Issuer’s and the Trustee’s rights prior to any such offer, sale or transfer (I) pursuant to clauses (iv) or
(v) prior to the Resale Restriction Termination Date to require the delivery of an opinion of counsel,
certification and/or other information satisfactory to each of them, (II) in each of the foregoing cases, to
require that a certificate of transfer in the form appearing on the other side of the security is completed

underlying assets are considered to include “plan assets” of such plan, account and arrangement (each,

**INDEPENDENT AUDITORS**

The consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries as of and for the years ended
December 31, 2020 and 2019 included elsewhere in this offering memorandum have been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers d.o.o. Zagreb, independent auditors, as stated in the report appearing herein. The
unaudited consolidated financial information of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31,
2018 have been included for comparative purposes. The consolidated interim financial statements of the
Company and its subsidiaries as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2021 included elsewhere in this
offering memorandum have been reviewed by PricewaterhouseCoopers d.o.o. Zagreb, independent auditors,
as stated in the report appearing herein. PricewaterhouseCoopers d.o.o. Zagreb, independent auditors,
reported that they reviewed the Company Unaudited Financial Statements, included in this offering
memorandum and issued an unqualified review report. However, their separate report, included herein, state
they did not audit and they do not express an audit opinion on the consolidated interim financial information.
Accordingly, the degree of reliance on their report on such information should be restricted in light of the
limited nature of the review procedures applied. The independent auditors’ report on the review of the
Company Unaudited Interim Financial Statements contains the following Emphasis of Matter: “We draw
attention to the note 2.1 which describes that these condensed consolidated financial statements have been
reissued for a reason of correction of disclosure in the note 3.2. Our conclusion is not modified in respect of
this matter.”

The consolidated financial statements of Vivacom and its subsidiaries as of and for the years ended
December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 included elsewhere in this offering memorandum have been audited by

**ENFORCEABILITY OF JUDGMENTS**

The Issuer is a Dutch company. The Guarantors are entities organized under the laws of the Netherlands,
Luxembourg, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Slovenia. The Vivacom Guarantors are entities organized under
the laws of Bulgaria. All the respective directors and executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors
reside outside of the United States. Substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors and their
respective directors and officers are located outside the United States. Although the Issuer and the Guarantors
have agreed, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, to accept service of process in the United States
through agents designated for such purpose, it may not be possible for holders of the New Notes to (a) effect
service of process upon the Issuer, the Guarantors or their respective directors or officers, or (b) enforce
judgments of courts of the United States predicated upon the civil liability of such entities or persons under
the U.S. securities laws and state securities laws or other laws against any such entities or persons in the courts
of a foreign jurisdiction.

**The Netherlands**

The Issuer and the Dutch Guarantors are incorporated under Dutch law and have their registered seat in the
Netherlands. None of the directors of the Issuer or the Dutch Guarantors reside in the United States and a
substantial amount of the Issuer’s assets, and a substantial amount of the assets of the Dutch Guarantors are
located outside of the United States. Civil liabilities based on the securities laws of the United States may not
be enforceable in the Netherlands, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained
in U.S. courts.

The United States and the Netherlands currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition
and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently,
a final judgment for payment given by any court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon
U.S. securities laws, would not be enforceable in the Netherlands. In order to obtain a judgment which is
enforceable in the Netherlands, the claim must be re litigated before a competent Dutch court. A Dutch court
will, under current practice, generally confirm a final, conclusive and enforceable U.S. judgement without
substantive re-examination or re litigation on the merits if (a) that judgment results from proceedings
compatible with the Dutch concept of due process, (b) that judgment does not contravene public policy
(openbare orde) of the Netherlands, (c) the jurisdiction of the court has been based on an internationally
acceptable ground,(d) the judgment by the court is not incompatible with a judgment rendered between the
same parties by a Dutch court, or with an earlier judgment rendered between the same parties by a non-Dutch
court in a dispute that concerns the same subject and is based on the same cause, provided that the earlier
judgment qualifies for recognition in the Netherlands and (e) the judgment is—according to the laws of the
country of origin—formally capable of being enforced (e.g. is readily enforceable, has not been annulled in
appeal or its enforceability has not been subjected to a certain timeframe).

Subject to the foregoing and provided that service of process occurs in accordance with applicable treaties,
investors may be able to enforce in the Netherlands, judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from
U.S. federal or state courts. However, no assurance can be given that such judgments will be enforceable. In
addition, it is doubtful whether a Dutch court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original
action commenced in the Netherlands and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.

Any enforcement of agreements governed by foreign law and any foreign judgments in the Netherlands will be
subject to the rules of Dutch civil procedure. Judgments may be rendered in a foreign currency but
enforcement is executed in EUR at the applicable rate of exchange. Enforcement of obligations in the
Netherlands will be subject to the nature of the remedies available in the courts of the Netherlands. Under
certain circumstances, a Dutch court has the power to stay proceedings (aanhouden) or to declare that it has
no jurisdiction, if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere.

A Dutch court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the
extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses and damages.

**Slovenia**

The United States and Slovenia are not currently party to a treaty for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in accordance with the New York Convention.
Therefore, an enforceable judgment for the payment of monies rendered by a U.S. federal or state court based
on civil liability would not be directly enforceable in Slovenia. However, a valid and legally binding judgment
from a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States may be recognized and enforced by a court of


-----

competent jurisdiction in Slovenia, subject to compliance with the enforcement procedures set forth in
Articles 94 et seq. of the Slovenian Private International Law and Procedure Act (Zakon o mednarodnem
_zasebnem pravu in postopku). Following such recognition, judgments of non-Slovenian courts have the same_
status and legal effect as those issued by Slovenian courts.

The Slovenian courts will recognize a U.S. judgment if the judgment is legally binding in the United States
and provided that all of the following conditions are met:

- the matter does not fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of a Slovenian court;

- the jurisdiction of the U.S. court was not based solely on the citizenship of the plaintiff, the property of the
defendant in the United States or personal service of the claim to the defendant;

- the U.S. court did not ignore the parties’ agreement on jurisdiction of Slovenian court;

- a Slovenian court has not issued a legally binding decision on the same matter and no other foreign court
decision has been recognized in Slovenia (res iudicata) (and in case of lis pendens the recognition process is
on hold);

- the recognition of the U.S. judgment would not contravene the public policy of Slovenia (ordre public);

- reciprocity is established (reciprocity is presumed unless proven otherwise; additionally, absence of
reciprocity is irrelevant when recognition or enforcement of a decision by a foreign court is sought by a
Slovenian citizen); and

- there were no procedural irregularities in the proceedings before the U.S. court that prevented the party
against which the judgment was issued to take part in the procedure (no breach of due process rights).

Subject to the above conditions, Slovenian courts will not review the merits of the foreign judgment. Slovenian
courts also do not review whether the foreign court has acted in accordance with its own procedural laws—
any such issues have to be resolved through an appeal process in that foreign jurisdiction.

The request for recognition of a U.S. judgment must include the original judgment or a certified copy, a
certificate of finality of the judgment, and a certified translation of the judgment.

If, upon recognition of a U.S. judgment in Slovenia, an opposing party does not pay its debt voluntarily, a
request for enforcement of the judgment must be made. This request must include a certificate of enforceability
of the judgment under the applicable U.S. law.

The international competence of courts and the recognition and enforcement of judgments of competent
courts of a EU Member State (other than Slovenia) are governed by Council Regulation (EC) No. 1215/2012
of 12 December 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and
commercial matters. In accordance with this regulation, if a court or competent authority so requires in
connection with the recognition and the enforcement of a foreign judgment, a translation of the relevant
documents must be produced and the translation must be certified by a person qualified to do so in one of the
member states. A judgment may not be recognized if its recognition is manifestly contrary to public policy in
the Member State in which recognition is sought; where it was given in default of appearance, if the defendant
was not served with the document which instituted the proceedings or with an equivalent document in
sufficient time and in such a way as to enable him to arrange for his defense, unless the defendant failed to
commence proceedings to challenge the judgment when it was possible for him to do so; if it is irreconcilable
with a judgment given in a dispute between the same parties in the Member State in which recognition is
sought; if it is irreconcilable with an earlier judgment given in another Member State or in a third state
involving the same cause of action and between the same parties, provided that the earlier judgment fulfills
the conditions necessary for its recognition in the Member State addressed; or if it conflicts with Section 6 of
Chapter II of the regulation dealing with exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Member States. Under no
circumstances may a foreign judgment be reviewed as to its substance.

In the event of any proceedings being brought in a Slovenian court in respect of a monetary obligation
expressed to be payable in a currency other than euro, a Slovenian court would have power to give judgment
expressed as an order to pay a currency other than euro. However, enforcement of the judgment against any
party in Slovenia would generally be available only in euro and for such purposes all claims or debts would be
converted into euro.

**Serbia**

Under the general conflict of laws rules, judgments of non-Serbian courts can be enforced in Serbia only if
they are recognized by a Serbian court.


-----

Recognition of a foreign judgment may be refused if:

- the respondent proves that it was not able to participate in the proceedings, particularly if it could not have
participated in the proceedings because there was no personal service of process;

- the court of Serbia, by virtue of Serbian Law, has exclusive jurisdiction in the relevant subject matter;

- a Serbian court or other official body has already passed or recognized a decision on the same subject
matter;

- the foreign judgment is found by the Serbian court to be contrary to the “foundations of social and political
order as determined in the Constitution” (i.e. public order);

- if a Serbian court establishes that there is no reciprocity in the matter of recognition and enforcement of
judgments rendered in commercial matters between Serbia and the home country of the judgment; and

- if the judgment is not final and conclusive (i.e. there are further appeals or revocation procedures or similar
actions have been commenced or are allowed).

From a procedural perspective, a foreign court judgment may be recognized (and further enforced) in Serbia
as part of a separate recognition procedure or as a preliminary question in the regular enforcement
proceedings.

Reciprocity is presumed until proven otherwise, and de facto reciprocity is sufficient. However, enforceability
of judgments of U.S. courts in Serbia cannot be confirmed. Serbia is not a party to any multilateral or bilateral
treaty pursuant to which the judgments of U.S. courts would be recognized and enforced, and it appears that
there are no cases that have established the principle of “factual reciprocity.”

Serbia is not a party to any multilateral or bilateral treaty pursuant to which the judgments of U.K. courts
would be recognized and enforced. However, U.K. court judgments can be recognized and enforced pursuant
to the general rules given above. Factual reciprocity between Serbia and the U.K. has been previously
confirmed by the Ministry of Justice but may be re-examined in a particular case if doubts exist as to its
continuing existence.

The party seeking recognition/enforcement must submit to the court:

- motion for recognition/enforcement;

- a confirmation by the foreign court that the foreign court’s judgment is final (i.e. that the judgment cannot
be appealed anymore) and enforceable between the parties under the law of the home country of the
judgment;

- the original judgment or its verified copy; and

- a verified Serbian translation of the judgment.

**Bosnia and Herzegovina**

Under the general conflict of laws rules, judgments of non-Bosnian courts can be enforced in Bosnia and
Herzegovina (“BiH”) only if they are recognized by a court in BiH.

Recognition of a foreign judgment may be refused if:

- the respondent proves that it was not able to participate in the proceedings due to procedural irregularities,
particularly if it could not have participated in the proceedings because there was no personal service of
process;

- the court of BiH, by virtue of law of BiH, has exclusive jurisdiction in the relevant subject matter;

- a BiH court or other official body has already passed or recognized a decision on the same subject matter;

- the foreign judgment is found by the BiH court to be contrary to the constitution or public policy of BiH;

- a BiH court establishes that there is no reciprocity in the matter of recognition and enforcement of
judgments passed in commercial matters between BiH and the foreign country in which the pertinent
judgment was passed; and

- if the decision is not final and conclusive (i.e. there are further appeals or revocation procedures or similar
actions have been commenced or are allowed).


-----

Reciprocity is presumed until proven otherwise. However, enforceability of judgments of U.S. or UK courts
in BiH cannot be confirmed. BiH is not a party to any multilateral or bilateral treaty pursuant to which the
judgments of U.S. or UK courts would be recognized and enforced, and it appears that there are no cases that
have established the principle of “factual reciprocity.”

**Luxembourg**

Each Luxembourg Guarantor is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and all of the managers and
executive officers of the Guarantors incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg are non-residents of the
United States. Furthermore, a substantial portion of the assets of each of the Guarantors incorporated under
the laws of Luxembourg is located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors
to effect service of process within the United States upon the relevant Guarantors, or to enforce against any of
them judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities
laws.

We have been advised by our Luxembourg counsel that the United States and Luxembourg are not currently
bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral
awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. According to such counsel, an enforceable judgment for the
payment of monies rendered by any U.S. Federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not
predicated solely upon the U.S. securities laws, would not directly be enforceable in Luxembourg. However, a
party who received such favorable judgment in a U.S. court may initiate enforcement proceedings in
Luxembourg (exequatur) by requesting enforcement of the U.S. judgment by the District Court (Tribunal
_d’Arrondissement) pursuant to Section 678 of the New Luxembourg Code of Civil Procedure. The District_
Court will authorize the enforcement in Luxembourg of the U.S. judgment if it is satisfied that all of the
following conditions are met:

- the U.S. judgment is final and enforceable (“exécutoire”) in the United States;

- the U.S. court awarding the judgment must have had jurisdiction to adjudicate the respective matter both
under applicable U.S. Federal or state jurisdictions rules, and under applicable Luxembourg international
private law conflict of jurisdiction rules and local law;

- the U.S. court has applied the substantive law as designated by Luxembourg conflict of laws rules, or at
least, the order must not contravene the principles underlying those rules;

- the U.S. judgment does not contravene international public policy or order as understood under the laws of
Luxembourg or has not been given in proceedings of a tax, penal or criminal nature (which would include
awards of damages made under civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws, or other laws, to
the extent that the same would be classified by Luxembourg courts as being of a penal or punitive nature
(for example, fines or punitive damages)). Ordinarily an award of monetary damages would not be
considered as a penalty, but if the monetary damages include punitive damages, such punitive damages
may be considered as a penalty;

- the U.S. court has acted in accordance with its own procedural laws;

- the judgment rendered by the U.S. court submitted to Luxembourg exequatur proceedings does not
contradict a judgment which has been rendered in the forum of the Luxembourg courts;

- the principles of fair trial and due process have been complied with and in particular the U.S. judgment was
granted following proceedings where the counterparty had the opportunity to appear, and if it appeared, to
present a defense; and

- the U.S. judgment was not granted pursuant to an evasion of Luxembourg law (“fraude à la loi
_luxembourgeoise”)._

Subject to the above conditions, Luxembourg courts tend not to review the merits of a foreign judgment,
although there is no statutory prohibition.

We have also been advised by our Luxembourg counsel that if an original action is brought in Luxembourg,
Luxembourg courts may refuse to apply the designated law (i) if the choice of such law was not made bona
fide and (ii) if its application contravenes Luxembourg public policy or is manifestly incompatible with
Luxembourg international policy rules. In an action brought in Luxembourg on the basis of U.S. federal or
state securities laws, Luxembourg courts may not have the requisite power to grant the remedies sought. Also,
an exequatur may be refused in respect of punitive damages.


-----

Further, in the event of any proceedings being brought in a Luxembourg court in respect of a monetary
obligation expressed to be payable in a currency other than Euro, a Luxembourg court would have power to
give judgment expressed as an order to pay a currency other than Euro. However, enforcement of the judgment
against any party in Luxembourg would be available only in Euro and for such purposes all claims or debts
would be converted into Euro.

**Bulgaria**

The United States and Bulgaria are not currently party to a treaty for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in accordance with the New York Convention.
However, a valid and legally binding judgment from a New York court may arguably be recognized and
enforced by a Bulgarian court under the general recognition and enforcement rules of the Bulgarian Private
International Law Code.

The rules under the Bulgarian Private International Law Code verbatim do not restrict the choice of court
arrangements to those of EU member states so it is arguable that choice of the courts of non-EU member
states are covered. However, an exclusive jurisdiction clause in favor of New York courts may be unenforceable
in Bulgaria due to art. 4, par. 1 of the Brussels Regulation (Recast) which provides that “subject to this
Regulation, persons domiciled in a Member State shall, whatever their nationality, be sued in the courts of
that Member State.” This rule may be interpreted as not permitting choice of courts arrangements different
from those under the Brussels Regulation (Recast) as EU Regulations are deemed to override any EU member
state national laws. We are not aware of any Bulgarian case law or case law of the Court of Justice of the
European Union that sheds light on how choice of New York courts arrangements should be treated. If and
as soon as the Hague Convention of 30 June 2005 on Choice of Court Agreements (which has been ratified by
the EU) will have been ratified by the United States (which is a signatory of this convention), this may change.

Subject to the above qualification, if it is accepted that the Brussels Regulation (Recast) is not an obstacle to
the application of the Bulgarian Private International Law Code, a New York court judgement may be
recognized and enforced if the following conditions are met:

(i) the New York court had jurisdiction according to the provisions of Bulgarian law, but not if the only
ground for the jurisdiction of the New York court over the dispute was the incorporation (nationality) of
the plaintiff in the jurisdiction of the seized court;

(ii) a copy of the statement of claim was served on the defendant, the parties were duly summonsed, and the
fundamental procedural principles of Bulgarian law, related to their defense have not been violated;

(iii) there is no Bulgarian court judgment in force based on the same facts, involving the same cause of action
and between the same parties;

(iv) there are no pending proceedings based on the same facts, involving the same cause of action and between
the same parties before a Bulgarian court, which has been brought earlier than the case instituted before
the New York court on which there is judgement whose recognition/enforcement is being sought;

(v) the recognition or enforcement is not contrary to Bulgarian public policy.

Regarding the first requirement for recognition/enforcement as listed above, i.e., competence of the New York
court under Bulgarian law, there is an express choice of court rule in the Private International Law Code
(applicable also to a choice of court in favor of non-EU member states) whereby the parties may choose via
agreement in writing a foreign (non-Bulgarian) jurisdiction in relation to proprietary matters provided that
the dispute does not fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Bulgarian courts. As the Brussels Regulation
(Recast) takes precedence over Bulgarian domestic private international law, a choice in favor of New Your
courts must furthermore not violate the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of other member states if the
prerequisites for such exclusive jurisdiction exist under the EU Brussels Regulation (Recast).

The action for enforcement of a New York judgment must be brought before the Sofia City Court. Alongside
the statement of claim (i.e. the request for recognition and enforcement), the following documents must be
presented:

(i) a certified copy of the judgment, authenticated by the New York court, and

(ii) a certificate issued by the New York court, confirming that said judgment has entered into force.


-----

These documents must be certified in accordance with the Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement of
Legalisation for Foreign Public Documents (i.e. the Apostille Convention) and translated into Bulgarian by a
translator certified by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Bulgaria.

The Sofia City Court must of its own motion establish the existence of the conditions for recognition/
enforcement listed above. The defendant in the proceedings for recognition or enforcement of a New York
judgement may not invoke violations of item (ii) of the list above if the defendant could have raised challenges
to such conditions before the New York court but failed to do so. In the recognition/enforcement proceedings,
the Bulgarian court would not examine the merits of the dispute as decided by the New York court.

The debtor may in the recognition/enforcement proceedings raise the defense that the obligation has been
extinguished on the basis of circumstances that have occurred after the New York judgement entered into
force. The debtor however may not raise the defense that the obligation has been extinguished as per the
preceding sentence if the Bulgarian judgment admitting enforcement has entered into force.

The judgment of the Sofia City Court in relation to the recognition of a New York court judgment is subject
to appeal before the Sofia Court of Appeals. The decision of the Sofia Court of Appeals is subject to appeal
before the Supreme Court of Cassation. The cassation procedure is conditional on the prior admission for
appeal and the party challenging the appellate judgment should provide evidence that the statutory grounds
for cassation are satisfied. The Supreme Court of Cassation grants the appellant a leave to appeal before
considering the cassation appeal on its merits. The cassation appeal to the Supreme Court of Cassation does
not suspend execution of the judgment of the appellate court. Thus, the judgment of the Sofia Court of
Appeals shall be enforceable and a party may initiate enforcement proceedings immediately after the judgment
of the appellate court.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM**
**FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

### Report on Review of Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements 

 to the Shareholders of Adria Midco B.V.

_Introduction_

We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated interim statement of financial position
of Adria Midco B.V. and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) as of 31 March 2021 and the related condensed
consolidated interim statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the three-month
ended 31 March 2021, changes in equity and cash flows for the three-month period ended 31 March
2021 and notes, comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes.
Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of this condensed consolidated
interim financial information in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 – ‘Interim
_financial reporting’ as adopted by the European Union. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion_
on this condensed consolidated interim financial information based on our review.

_Scope of Review_

We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements 2410,
‘Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity’. A
review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible
for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all
significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit
opinion.

_Conclusion_

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the
accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements are not prepared, in all material
respects, in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 – ‘Interim financial reporting’ as
adopted by the European Union.

_Emphasis of Matter_

We draw attention to the note 2.1 which describes that these condensed consolidated financial
statements have been reissued for a reason of correction of disclosure in the note 3.2. Our conclusion
is not modified in respect of this matter.

**FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**In thousands of EUR unless otherwise stated**

**1.** **General information**

Adria Midco B.V. (the Company) is a company domiciled in Netherlands, registered on 3 October 2013.

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company for the period ended 31 March 2021
comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”). List of subsidiaries is
presented in the note 37.

The Group is one of the largest telecommunication operators in South East Europe providing video, data,
voice and mobile telephone services to residential and business subscribers. The Group has media activities
which fall into following categories: content production, distribution, advertising and digital. The Group’s
activities are mainly based in Serbia, Slovenia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Croatia,
Bulgaria and Greece.

On 4 March 2019 Summer Bidco B.V., an entity controlled by Funds advised by BC Partners completed the
acquisition of majority ownership of the Group following the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals.

**2.** **Basis of preparation**

**2.1.** **Statement of compliance**

These condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the three months period ended 31 March 2021
have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard IAS 34 Interim Financial
Reporting as adopted by EU and should be read in conjunction with the Group’s last annual consolidated
financial statements as at 31 December 2020. They do not include all of the information for a full set of IFRS
financial statements. However, the selected explanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions
that are significant to an understanding of the changes in the Group’s financial position and performance
since the last annual financial statements. These consolidated interim financial statements are not statutory
consolidated financial statements and they are prepared for the purpose of providing information to owners
and providers of financing to the Group.

IFRS requires the management to adopt accounting policies that are the most appropriate to the Group’s
circumstances. These have been applied consistently to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

These condensed consolidated interim financial statements are reissued due to the correction of an error in
the disclosure of maturity of the Other financial liabilities—bonds, in the Note 3.2 in the condensed
consolidated interim financial statements dated on 21 May 2021. The condensed consolidated interim financial
statements were authorized for issue by the Board of Directors on 25 June 2021.

**2.2.** **Basis of measurement**

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Group for the period ended 31 March 2021
have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for certain financial instruments, investment
property and assets held for sale.

**2.3.** **Going concern**

The Group has reported a net loss for the three-month period ended 31 March 2021 in the amount of
EUR 9,920 thousand (three-month period ended 31 March 2020: EUR 13,378 thousand) which is mainly
attributable to increase in finance cost due to additional bonds issued during 2020 and 2021 which were used
for the acquisition of VIVACOM Group, repay a portion of the amounts drawn under the Revolving Credit
Facility that were used to fund the purchase price for the Nova Broadcasting Group Acquisition and to pay
transaction costs associated with the bond offering (note 31).

The Group has reported a net loss for the three-month period ended 31 March 2020 in the amount of
EUR 13,378 thousand which was influenced by mainly by higher finance costs caused by issuing new bonds
(note 31).

**NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM**
**FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**In thousands of EUR unless otherwise stated**

**2.** **Basis of preparation (continued)**

The expansion of the Group is based on a leveraged buyout strategy resulting in an increased finance debt
and the associated net finance expenses. The Group’s key performance indicators are Adjusted Earnings
Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) (see note 5 for definition). Adjusted
EBITDA for the three-month period ended 31 March 2021 has increased by 129% comparing to the same
period for the 2020. Significant increase in Adjusted EBITDA mainly is result of acquired companies
(notes 15, 21).

The Group regularly (daily and monthly) analyses liquidity projections, internal financial reports, availability
of financial assets and ability to repay its liabilities through daily and/or monthly review of budgeted and
actual cash flows and monitoring of maturity of the Group’s receivables and liabilities.

Primary sources of the Group’s liquidity and funds for capital expenditures, acquisitions and other
investments have been operating cash flows, revolving credit facilities, ancillary lending facilities and leases.
The Group has reported net cash inflow from operating activities in the amount of EUR 94,018 thousand for
the three-month period ended 31 March 2021. The Group was able to repay its obligations when they fell due
in the normal course of business with no defaults in repayment of debt, the associated financial interest
expenses nor any other liabilities. As at 31 March 2021, the Group has outstanding loans in the amount of
EUR 82,903 thousand and bond liabilities (including interest) in the amount of EUR 3,288,932 thousand
which matures from 2024 to 2028. In February 2020, the Group issued bonds in the amount of
EUR 1,675,000 thousand for the purpose of acquisition of BTC Group as well as early repayment of one
bond tranche and repayment part of the RCF. These bonds issuance is with maturity date in 2026 and 2028
(note 31). In November 2020, additional bonds were issued in the amount of EUR 400 million with maturity
in 2027 and in January 2021 additional EUR 150 million with the same maturity.

As at 31 March 2021 the Group has an undrawn revolving credit line in the amount of EUR 283,488 thousand
(31 December 2020: EUR 353,422 thousand) (note 31).

According to the Group’s business plan for 2021, the Group will continue to grow and expects increase in
Adjusted EBITDA, which will provide sufficient ground for financing debt, capital expenditures and working
capital.

The following further forms the basis of management’s use of going concern:

- The Group has grown its share of the telco and media market in the region.

- The Group maintains a high level of business ethics and regulatory compliance and there is no indication of
any foreseeable material adverse change in the regulatory landscape.

- The Group is complied with the covenants related to the listed bonds and senior credit facilities as at
31 March 2021 and expects to remain compliant with these covenants over the duration of the forecast
period (being for at least twelve months after the date of signing of the financial statements). See notes 4
and 31 for further details of the covenants.

Based on the Group’s going concern assessment, the condensed consolidated interim financial statements of
the Group for the period ended 31 March 2021 are, therefore, prepared on a going concern basis, as
management have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future.

**2.4.** **COVID-19**

The existence of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was confirmed in early 2020 and has spread rapidly from
mainland China across the globe, causing disruptions to businesses and economic activity and it continued to
shape its course in 2021.

Economic development over the coming months will depend on the spread of infection. Vaccines against
COVID-19 became available in December 2020 which substantially reduce the probability of infection.

**NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM**
**FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**In thousands of EUR unless otherwise stated**

**2.** **Basis of preparation (continued)**

The impact of this outbreak on macroeconomic forecasts and markets are incorporated into the Group’s
estimates of expected credit loss provisions for financial assets and other impairments assessments in 2021,
including but not limited to: Goodwill, Property, plant and equipment, Intangible assets and Programming
rights.

Management has reasonable expectations that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future. The results of management review of the Group’s market, operations and
financials in the past year and a forecast for at least twelve months after the date of signing of the financial
statements provides a sound basis for the appropriateness of using the going concern assumption in the
preparation of the Group’s financial statements for the period ended 31 March 2021, though the existence of
Coronavirus (COVID-19) means there is generally a level of uncertainty in the wider macro market.

Management concluded that the range of possible outcomes considered at arriving at this judgment does not
give rise to material uncertainties related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s
ability to continue as a going concern for at least twelve months from the date of authorization of the financial
statements for issue.

**2.4.1.** **Revenues and Adjusted EBITDA**

There is positive impact to organic consolidated revenues in 2021 amounts of 1% comparing the same period
last year. The Group recorded decrease of 4% in organic Adjusted EBITDA comparing to the same period
2020 mainly as a negative impact of COVID-19 to its Media segment.

The Group’s telco segments have continued to meet customers’ expectations on service level and network
operating centre has maintained normal service levels. No significant change in customer database is
experienced during reporting period ended 31 March 2021. Negative effect of increase in bad debt and decline
in revenue from sale of handsets and roaming was mainly offset with decline in churn rate due to limitation in
direct sale to customers. At the same time, the Group has implemented cost savings measures such as: decrease
in travelling, representation and consulting costs.

In its Media segment (organic), external revenue decreased by 11% comparing to the same period previous
year as certain contract for carriage fee were not prolonged (expired as Covid-19 crisis has begun) and
currently are under further negotiations with customers, dominantly in Slovenia. This is the main reason for
decline in Adjusted EBITDA comparing to three months period ended 31 March 2021. Revenues streams of
media business which were mostly affected with the lockdown and state of emergency across the region, are
expected to be at pre-COVID19 level by the end of 2021 and to continuous growth is expected afterwards.

**2.4.2.** **Financing and liquidity**

The Group have sufficient cash reserves and cash generated for the forecast period to meet its financing
obligations. Net working capital is regularly monitored at each component level. During 2021 further measures
were applied by governments however, cash flow was stable during three months period ended 31 March 2021.
As at the date of this report, there is no adverse impact on cash flow.

Efforts have been made to keep collection of receivables at highest possible level which resulted in increased
net impairment of trade receivables in comparison to the same period previous year 52%
(e.g EUR 1.1 million), although the Group increased its revenue by 127% (e.g EUR 245 million) comparing to
same period 2021.

In February 2020 the Group issued bonds for the purpose of acquisition of VIVACOM Group and
refinancing part of existing debt by which interest rates decreased and maturity was extended until 2028. In
November 2020 and January 2021 issued bonds were issued for the purpose of repayment part of RCF as well
as acquisition of Nova Broadcasting Group (see note 31).

Currently available credit lines amount to EUR 283 million with extended maturity to 2025 (see note 31).

For sensitivity analysis on interest rate risk, please see note 3.3.3.

**2.5.** **Use of estimates and judgments**

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Group for the period ended 31 March 2021
require management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting
policies and the Group’s reported financial position, results or cash flows and disclosure of contingent assets
or liabilities during the reporting period. Actual outcomes could differ from those estimates.

Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and other factors, including industry practices
and expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting estimates
are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.

The accounting estimates and judgements applied in these condensed consolidated interim financial
statements are the same as those applied in the Group’s consolidated financial statements as at and for the
year ended 31 December 2020.

**2.6.** **Functional and presentation currency**

These condensed consolidated interim financial statements are presented in Euros, which is the Company’s
functional currency. Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured
using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (“the functional
currency”).

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at
exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies at the reporting date are translated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated to the
functional currency at the exchange rate when the fair value was determined. Foreign currency differences are
recognized in consolidated statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income. Non-monetary
items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are not translated.

Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation
at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized
in profit or loss and presented within finance costs.

**Foreign operations**

The results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency different from the
presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:

- assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the reporting date,

- income and expenses for each statement of profit or loss are translated at average exchange rates (unless
this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the
transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of transactions)
and,

- the translation adjustment resulting from the use of these different rates is included in other comprehensive
income

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and
liabilities of the foreign operation and translated accordingly.

Exchange rates applied in those consolidated financial statements are as follows:

**3.** **Financial risk management**

This note presents information about the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and
managing credit, liquidity and market risk. Also presents the exposure and sensitivity of the Group to these
risks.

There is no change of financial risk and financial risk management compared to consolidated financial
statements as at 31 December 2020.

The Group’s managing board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s
risk management framework, and development and monitoring of the Group’s risk management policies.

The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to
set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management
policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities.
The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to maintain a disciplined
and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.

The finance function monitors compliance with the Group’s risk management policies and procedures, and
provides top management with feedback regarding the performance of the framework in relation to the risk
faced by the Group.

**3.1.** **Credit risk**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument
fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers,
contract assets, cash and cash equivalents held at banks, loans and financial guarantees issued by the Group
and the indemnification asset.

**3.1.1.** **Exposure to credit risk**

The following table represents the maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date:

**3.1.2.** **Trade and other receivables (including contract assets)**

The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The Group assesses that it has no significant concentration of credit risk due to its exposure to a broad
customer base in each service line. No concentration of credit risk on a geographical basis is assessed as
material. The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure for each customer including services
disconnection procedure.

Customer credit risk is managed by the Group’s business units which each have policies, procedures and
controls relating to customer credit risk management. Outstanding trade receivables and contract assets are
regularly reviewed to monitor any changes in credit risk with concentrations of credit risk considered to be
limited given that the Group’s customer base is large and unrelated. The Group applies the simplified approach
and records lifetime expected credit losses for trade receivables and contract assets.

The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to
credit risk at the reporting date was:

respect of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Group for the period ended 31
March 2021. For trade receivables presented in bucket over nine months, for which the Group has liabilities
and legal right to offset them with receivables and receivables in the amount of EUR 8,747 thousand from
stated-owned company which the Group has assessed as collectable as these will be reimbursed from state
budget, no impairment has been recognized.

The contract assets are all not yet due as at 31 March 2021 and 31 December 2020. The default rate applied to
calculated the expected credit loss in relation to contract assets is the same as applied to trade receivables not
due 0.4%-2.6% (2020: 0.2%-2.6%).

The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect with trade and other receivables, including contract
assets during period ending 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2020 was as follows:

**3.1.3.** **Other financial assets**

A loss allowance in relation to Other financial assets is determined individually for each balance. In order to
assess credit risk publicly available information to determine default rates. Other than what was already
provided in financial statements in previous periods, no other exposure to significant credit risk was identified,
so the calculation of the loss allowances resulted in immaterial amounts for those balances.

Impairment of other financial assets is presented in table below:

Total amount of long-term loans relates to loan to Totalna Televizija d.o.o. At 31 March 2021 this loan is
considered as non-performing as principal repayments are more than 90 days past due and loss allowance is
based on lifetime expected credit loss.

Under Other financial assets, the Group reported indemnification asset for acquisition of VIVACOM Group
in the amount of EUR 49,238 thousand. Considering the fact that the full indemnification amount is
deposited at banks, the expected credit loss in relation to this indemnification asset as at 31 March 2021 was
assessed as not material (note 26).

**3.1.4.** **Short term loans and deposits**

A loss allowance in relation to short term loans and deposits is determined individually for each balance. In
order to assess credit risk publicly available information to determine default rates. No exposure to any
significant credit risk was identified, the calculation of the loss allowances resulted in immaterial amounts.

**3.1.5.** **Cash and cash equivalents**

The Group holds cash in a number of banks in order to avoid concentration risk. A loss allowance in relation
to cash and cash equivalents is determined individually for each balance with a given financial institution. In
order to assess credit risk, external credit ratings and publicly available information on default rates for a
given rating of Standard & Poor’s rating agency were used. As all cash balances have a low credit risk as at the
reporting date and comparative period, the Group applied the practical expedient available under IFRS 9 and
determined the loss allowances based on 12-month expected credit losses. The calculation of the loss
allowances resulted in an immaterial amount.

The Group held cash and cash equivalents of EUR 166,041 thousand as 31 March 2021 (31 December 2020:
EUR 285,405 thousand) with reputable local commercial banks, which represents its maximum credit
exposure on these assets.

Management actively monitors credit risk exposure and given that the Group only has invested in bank
deposits management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.

**3.2.** **Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its
financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group’s approach to
managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its
liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or
risking damage to the Group’s reputation.

The Group’s policy on liquidity is to maintain sufficient liquid resources to meet its obligations as they fall
due, which has been achieved through appropriate bank arrangements (note 31). Typically, the Group seeks
to ensure that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected current liabilities as they fall due, including
the servicing of financial obligations; this excludes the potential impact of extreme circumstances that cannot
reasonably be predicted, such as natural disasters.

The Group has covenants relating to Revolving Credit Facility and bonds. Covenants relating to bonds are
active only when the Group decides to issue new bonds or refinance old one. Covenants relating to RCF are
monitored regularly (note 31).

**3.3.** **Market risk**

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity
prices will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of
market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while
optimizing the return.

**3.3.1.** **Currency risk**

Currency risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognized assets or liabilities are denominated
in a currency that is not the functional currency of the Group entity holding the asset or obligation.

Different entities within the Group have different functional currencies, based on the underlying economic
conditions of their operations. Other than Euro, which is the Company’s functional currency, the Group’s
subsidiaries have local functional currencies: Serbian dinar (“RSD”), Croatian kuna (“HRK”), Bosnian
Konvertibilna marka (“BAM”), Bulgarian lev (“BGN”) and Swiss franc (“CHF”). The Bosnia Konvertibilna
marka and Bulgarian lev are pegged to the Euro. Accordingly, the main exposure to currency risk comes from
relates to purchases and borrowings which are denominated in Euros and US dollars, while a significant share
of the Group’s revenue is denominated in Serbian dinars, Swiss franc and Croatian kuna.

The Group has exposure to currency fluctuation (depreciation) of RSD (Serbian dinar) to Euro given that it
has significant operations through SBB Serbia for which RSD is the functional currency and that has
significant borrowings in Euro. The Group’s currency risk policy for this exposure is implemented through
regular price adjustments on the Serbian market, following the depreciation of Serbian dinar against Euro.

The following table presents sensitivities of profit or loss and equity to reasonably possible changes in
exchange rates to EUR applied at the end of the reporting period relative to the functional currency of the
respective Group entities, with all other variables held constant:

**3.3.2.** **Price risk**

The Group is not exposed to material price risks on its financial instruments.

**3.3.3.** **Interest rate risk**

The Group’s cash flow interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings, loans to related parties issued at
variable rates and lease liabilities, whereas the borrowings at the fixed rate are exposed to fair value risk
nevertheless it does not impact the financial statements as these borrowings are measured at amortised cost.
The Group closely monitors current market rates in order to minimize negative effects of significant
movements in market rates. The Group does not use these instruments for speculative purposes.

**3.4.** **Fair value hierarchy**

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The best evidence of fair value is the price
in an active market. An active market is one in which transactions for the asset or liability take place with
sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

Valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow models or models based on recent arm’s length transactions
or consideration of financial data of the investees are used to measure fair value of certain financial
instruments for which external market pricing information is not available. Fair value measurements are
analysed by level in the fair value hierarchy as follows:

- level one is measurements at quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities,

- level two measurements are valuations techniques with all material inputs observable for the asset or liability,
either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices), and

- level three measurements are valuations not based on solely observable market data (that is, the
measurement requires significant unobservable inputs). Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy
are deemed to have occurred at the end of the reporting period.

The table below shows the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities,
including their levels in fair values hierarchy. It does not include information for financial assets and financial
liabilities not measured at fair value if the carrying amount if reasonable approximation of fair value.

The fair values of the Other financial liabilities—bonds are calculated by discounting the future cash flows to
net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at 31 March 2021. The valuation basis is level 2.
This classification comprises items where fair value is determined from inputs other than quoted prices that
are observable for the liability, either directly or indirectly.

**4.** **Capital management**

Due to the structure of long-term financing through leveraged buyout arrangement, the management policy
is to maintain a stable return on investment so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to
sustain future development of the business. The Group’s performance management is focused on generating
budgeted Adjusted EBITDA as well as maintaining overall liquidity position to repay the financial debt
(note 3.2). An important key performance indicator for the communication with investors, analysts, and rating
agencies is Pro Forma Net leverage (calculated as Adjusted Pro Forma Net Debt to Annualized Last Two
Quarters Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA). “Annualised” amounts are calculated by multiplying the amounts
for last two quarters by 2. This pro forma ratio stood at 4.85x at 31 March 2021 (31 December 2020: 4.7x).

Annualized Last Two Quarters Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Pro Forma Net Debt are nonGAAP figures not governed by International Financial Reporting Standards, and their definition and
calculation may vary from one company to another. These measures are prepared by the Group on a Pro
Forma basis and present hypothetically the Group’s adjusted net debt and Annualised Last two Quarters
adjusted EBITDA as though the acquisition of Forthnet Group (control obtained on 12 November 2020),
Nova Broadcasting Group (acquired on 22 January 2021) and other events and operations that are directly
related to these acquisitions, as well as other acquisitions (for which the Group signed agreements for
acquisition and are in process of receiving regulatory approvals,), had taken place at 30 September 2020.

The unaudited/unreviewed pro forma been prepared solely for management purposes and due to its nature
presents a hypothetical situation; therefore, it does not present the actual results financial results, financial
standing, and any other financial measures of the Group for the presented periods, had the events and
operations discussed really taken place on the assumed dates, and its purpose is not to determine the actual
results and financial standing in any future periods.

Most of the Group’s business segments are mainly based on the Group’s geographic regions, Serbia, Bulgaria,
Slovenia, Greece, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Montenegro, and the media segment is broadly based
on product distribution. They are managed separately because each business unit requires different marketing
strategies and service level.

**5.3.** **Measurement of operating segment profit or loss**

The CODM reviews financial information prepared based on IFRS adjusted to meet the requirements of
internal reporting. Such financial information differs in certain aspects from IFRS:

- Management consolidation adjustments can differ from the ones required by IFRS;

- non-IFRS profit measures (such as earnings before income tax, depreciation and amortization—EBITDA,
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Capital Expenditure (Adjusted CAPEX)) are also included in the segment
report. Adjusted CAPEX represents purchases of tangible and intangible assets, consisting primarily of set
top box purchases and other customer capital expenditure, installations (including capitalized labour costs),
cable and mobile network build out, upgrades, maintenance and other investments, computer hardware
and software and content rights.

CODM evaluates performance of each segment based on revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA and other
key performance indicators (e.g. average revenue per user, CAPEX) and does not regularly review assets and
liabilities of the segments.

Income tax expense is recognized at the amount determined by multiplying the profit/(loss) before tax for
components for the interim reporting period by management’s best estimate of the annual income tax rate
expected for the full financial year, adjusted for the tax effects of certain items recognized in the full in interim
period. As such, the effective tax rate in the interim financial statements may differ from management’s
estimate of the effective tax rate for the annual financial statements.

The estimated average tax rate used for the three months period ended 31 March 2021 is 37%, compared to
12% for the three months ended 31 March 2020. The tax rate is higher in 2020 mainly as netting effects of
acquired companies which contributed with positive result and increase in interest expense for new financing,
increased loss before tax, but did not have impact on current tax.

On 29 April 2021 the Group concluded agreement to acquire entire share capital of local internet and TV
operators Networx-Bulgaria EOOD, TVN Distribution Bulgaria EOOD and Telco Infrastructures EOOD in
Bulgaria. The transactions are subject to relevant regulatory approvals.

Considering the finalisation of the acquisition the disclosures required by IFRS 3 are not presented due to the
fact that the acquisition has not yet reached the stage when management can reliably disclose the details.

On 14 May 2021 the Group concluded agreement to acquire 70% of share capital of companies Mainstream
d.o.o. and IT4Biz d.o.o. in Serbia for cash consideration of EUR 4,315 thousand. The fair value of the net
identifiable assets of the acquired companies at the date of acquisition has not been determined yet, as the
closing accounts as of this date have not been finalized.

The Group’s management holds that they are not aware of any other significant post balance sheet events that
could affect the condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Group for the period ended 31
March 2021 or require separate disclosure.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

#### Independent Auditor’s Report

To the Shareholder of Adria Midco BV:

Our opinion

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Adria Midco BV (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (together - the
“Group”) as at 31 December 2020, and the Group’s consolidated financial performance and
consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards as adopted by the European Union.

**What we have audited**

The Group’s consolidated financial statements comprise:

        - the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the year ended
31 December 2020;

        - the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2020;

        - the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year ended 31 December 2020;

        - the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended 31 December 2020; and

        - the notes to the consolidated financial statements, which include significant accounting policies
and other explanatory information.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the
audit of the consolidated financial statements section of our report.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our opinion.

**Independence**

We are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Code of Ethics for Professional
Accountants (including International Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics
Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA Code). We have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in
accordance with the IESBA Code.

Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the
consolidated financial statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the
European Union, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the
preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due
to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to
liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting
process.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue
an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is
not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material
if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain
professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and
obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk
of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the
override of internal control.

- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.

- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by management.

- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events
or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s
report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up
to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to
cease to continue as a going concern.

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the
underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or
business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial
statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit.
We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in
internal control that we identify during our audit.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**In thousands of EUR unless otherwise stated**

**1.** **General information**

Adria Midco B.V. (the Company) is a company domiciled in Netherlands, registered on 3 October 2013.

The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2020 comprise the
Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”). List of subsidiaries is presented in the
note 41.

The Group is one of the largest telecommunication operators in South East Europe providing video, data,
voice and mobile telephone services to residential and business subscribers. The Group has media activities
which fall into following categories: content production, distribution, advertising and digital. The Group’s
activities are mainly based in Serbia, Slovenia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Croatia,
Bulgaria and Greece.

On 4 March 2019 Summer Bidco B.V., an entity controlled by Funds advised by BC Partners completed the
acquisition of majority ownership of the Group following the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals.

**2.** **Basis of preparation**

This section sets out Group’s significant accounting policies that relate to the financial statements as a whole
and describes the critical accounting judgements and estimates that management has identified as having a
potentially material impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements. Where an accounting policy is
generally applicable to a specific note to the financial statements, the policy is described within that note.
Below are presented the new accounting pronouncements that the Group will adopt in future years and current
view of the impact they will have on the Group’s financial reporting.

**2.1. Statement of compliance**

The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), as adopted by the European Union (EU). These consolidated
financial statements are not statutory consolidated financial statements and they are prepared for the purpose
of providing information to owners of the Group.

IFRS requires the management to adopt accounting policies that are the most appropriate to the Group’s
circumstances. These have been applied consistently to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

In 2020 the Group changed accounting policy for investment property. This change to significant accounting
policies is described in note 3.

Certain comparative amounts do not correspond to the 2019 consolidated financial statements and reflect
reclassification adjustments made to conform to the current period presentation. Specifically, the following
comparative balances as of 31 December 2019 were reclassified in the consolidated statement of financial
position as of 31 December 2020:

- Interest payable EUR 33,294 thousand (as of 31 December 2019 EUR 26,323 thousand) is now presented
within line Interest payables—bond, whilst in consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2019
where it was presented in line Trade and other payables.

- Impairment losses on trade and other receivables, including contract assets and Impairment losses on other
financial assets are renamed in 2020 into Net impairment on trade and other receivables, including contract
assets and Net impairment on other financial assets.

The above change was considered by the Group as a change in accounting policy and in line with IAS 8 it was
applied retrospectively, however due to the nature of the change, the statement of financial position was
impacted, therefore presenting an additional statement of financial position is not considered to be relevant
for the Group.

The consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue by the Board of Directors on 22 April 2021.

**ADRIA MIDCO B.V. GROUP**

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**In thousands of EUR unless otherwise stated**

**2.** **Basis of preparation (continued)**

**2.2. Basis of measurement**

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for
certain financial instruments, investment property and assets held for sale.

**2.3. Going concern**

The Group has reported a net loss for the year ended 31 December 2020 in the amount of
EUR 72,426 thousand (2019: EUR 60,036 thousand) which is mainly attributable to increase in finance cost
due to additional bonds issued during 2020 which was used for the acquisition of VIVACOM Group as well
as redemption of existing bond and partial repayment of revolving credit facility (see note 15).

The Group has reported a net loss for the year ended 31 December 2019 in the amount of
EUR 60,036 thousand which was influenced by several factors including, but not limited to: a share-based
payment arrangement started in 2018 resulting in additional staff cost in the amount of EUR 21,659 thousand
for 2019 and redemption fee option for early repayment of bond in the amount of EUR 12,578 thousand.

The expansion of the Group is based on a leveraged buyout strategy resulting in an increased finance debt
and the associated net finance expenses. The Group’s key performance indicators are Adjusted Earnings
Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) (see note 7 for definition). Adjusted
EBITDA for the year ended 31 December 2020 has increased by 47% comparing to the same period for the
2019. Significant increase in Adjusted EBITDA mainly is result of acquired companies (notes 17, 23).

The Group regularly (daily and monthly) analyses liquidity projections, internal financial reports, availability
of financial assets and ability to repay its liabilities through daily and/or monthly review of budgeted and
actual cash flows and monitoring of maturity of the Group’s receivables and liabilities.

Primary sources of the Group’s liquidity and funds for capital expenditures, acquisitions and other
investments have been operating cash flows, revolving credit facilities, ancillary lending facilities and leases.
The Group has reported net cash inflow from operating activities in the amount of EUR 293,149 thousand
for the year ended 31 December 2020. The Group was able to repay its obligations when they fell due in the
normal course of business with no defaults in repayment of debt, the associated financial interest expenses
nor any other liabilities. As at 31 December 2020, the Group has outstanding loans in the amount of
EUR 2,158 thousand and bond liabilities (including interest) in the amount of EUR 3,151,735 thousand
which matures from 2024 to 2028. In February 2020, the Group issued bonds in the amount of EUR
1,675 million for the purpose of acquisition of BTC Group as well as early repayment of one bond tranche
and repayment part of the RCF. These bonds issuance is with maturity date in 2026 and 2028 (note 33). In
November 2020, additional bonds were issued in the amount of EUR 400 million with maturity in 2027 and
in January 2021 additional EUR 100 million with the same maturity.

As at 31 December 2020 the Group has an undrawn revolving credit line in the amount of
EUR 353,422 thousand (31 December 2019: EUR 153,246 thousand) (note 33).

According to the Group’s business plan for 2021, the Group will continue to grow and expects increase in
Adjusted EBITDA, which will provide sufficient ground for financing debt, capital expenditures and working
capital.

The following further forms the basis of management’s use of going concern:

- The Group has grown its share of the telco and media market in the region.

- The Group maintains a high level of business ethics and regulatory compliance and there is no indication of
any foreseeable material adverse change in the regulatory landscape.

- The Group is complied with the covenants related to the listed bonds and senior credit facilities as at 31
December 2020 and expects to remain compliant with these covenants over the duration of the forecast
period (being for at least twelve months after the date of signing of the financial statements). See notes 5
and 33 for further details of the covenants.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**In thousands of EUR unless otherwise stated**

**2.** **Basis of preparation (continued)**

Based on the Group’s going concern assessment, the consolidated financial statements are, therefore, prepared
on a going concern basis, as management have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.

**2.4. COVID-19**

The existence of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was confirmed in early 2020 and has spread rapidly from
mainland China across the globe, causing disruptions to businesses and economic activity and it will continue
to shape its course in 2021.

Many governments across the world have imposed travel restrictions, lock downs and social distancing with a
view to reducing the spread of the virus and hopefully minimizing the number of fatalities. Currently, the
world is experiencing continued spread of COVID-19, further waves of infection. The extent to which the
COVID-19 pandemic negatively affects business, results of operations and financial condition depends on
several factors, such as the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, any additional periods of
lockdown in the countries in which customers are located, and the pace at which demand, pricing and, in
general, economic and operating conditions will stabilize and recover in the countries where the Group
operate. Any future developments are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and
duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response
to the pandemic.

The main priority has been the health and safety of employees and continuous provision of service. The
Group has adhered to instructions issued by the state authorities, including travel restrictions and enforced
working from home. Management believes that the impact on business is currently limited with no immediate
material adverse operational impact. Management intend to continue to follow the various national and/or
state authorities’ policies and, in parallel, intend to do utmost to continue operations as the situation evolves.

Whilst inherently uncertain, and the management expects some impact to operations and performance but
currently does not believe that the COVID-19 outbreak will directly have a material adverse effect on the
Group’s financial condition or liquidity for the foreseeable future such that it is not appropriate to apply the
going concern principal to these financial statements.

The impact of this outbreak on macroeconomic forecasts and markets are incorporated into the Group’s
estimates of expected credit loss provisions for financial assets and other impairments assessments in 2020,
including but not limited to: Goodwill, Property, plant and equipment, Intangible assets and Programming
rights.

Management has reasonable expectations that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future. The results of management review of the Group’s market, operations and
financials in the past year and a forecast for at least twelve months after the date of signing of the financial
statements provides a sound basis for the appropriateness of using the going concern assumption in the
preparation of the Group’s financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2020, though the existence
of Coronavirus (COVID-19) means there is generally a level of uncertainty in the wider macro market.

Management concluded that the range of possible outcomes considered at arriving at this judgment does not
give rise to material uncertainties related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s
ability to continue as a going concern for at least twelve months from the date of authorization of the financial
statements for issue.

2.4.1. Revenues and Adjusted EBITDA

Negative impact to organic consolidated revenues in 2020 amounts to 1.5% comparing the year ended
31 December 2019. The Group recorded decrease of 2.6% in organic Adjusted EBITDA comparing to the
same period 2019.

The Group’s telco segments have continued to meet customers’ expectations on service level and network
operating centre has maintained normal service levels. No significant change in customer database is

experienced in 2020. Negative effect of increase in bad debt and decline in revenue from sale of handsets and
roaming was mainly offset with decline in churn rate due to limitation in direct sale to customers. At the same
time, the Group has implemented cost savings measures such as: decrease in travelling, representation and
consulting costs.

In its Media segment, revenue decreased by 14% comparing to the same period previous year. Postponing of
certain sports events effected by reduction of revenue and relevant costs by 9%. Decline in media selling
revenue is offset by decline in relevant costs. All this combined by overall cost optimization efforts resulted in
decrease of 7% in Adjusted EBITDA in Media segment compared to the year ended 31 December 2019.

2.4.2. Financing and liquidity

The Group have sufficient cash reserves and cash generated for the forecast period to meet its financing
obligations. Net working capital is regularly monitored at each component level. During 2020 some countries
declared state of emergency and social distancing rules and store closures which had effect of cash collection
in the first weeks of April. After the easing the measures in May, cash flow stabilised. As at the date of this
report, there is no adverse impact on cash flow.

Certain capex investments, except those necessary for maintaining regular operations, have been postponed.

Efforts have been made to keep collection of receivables at highest possible level which resulted in increase of
Net impairment of trade receivables for EUR 924 thousand in comparison to previous year, although the
Group increased its revenue by 50% in 2020.

In February 2020 the Group issued bonds for the purpose of acquisition of VIVACOM Group and
refinancing part of existing debt by which interest rates decreased and maturity was extended until 2028. In
November 2020 issued bonds were issued for the purpose of repayment part of RCF as well as acquisition of
Nova Broadcasting Group (see notes 33, 40).

Currently available credit lines amount to EUR 360 million with extended maturity to 2025 (see note 33).

For sensitivity analysis on interest rate risk, please see note 4.3.3.

**2.5. Use of estimates and judgments**

The consolidated financial statements require management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions
that affect the application of accounting policies and the Group’s reported financial position, results or cash
flows and disclosure of contingent assets or liabilities during the reporting period. Actual outcomes could
differ from those estimates.

Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and other factors, including industry practices
and expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting estimates
are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.

The Group’s critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty are detailed in section
**Critical accounting estimates and judgments.**

**2.6. Functional and presentation currency**

These consolidated financial statements are presented in Euros, which is the Company’s functional currency.
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of
the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”).

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at
exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies at the reporting date are translated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date.

**2.** **Basis of preparation (continued)**

Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated to the
functional currency at the exchange rate when the fair value was determined. Foreign currency differences are
recognized in consolidated statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income. Non-monetary
items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are not translated.

Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation
at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized
in profit or loss and presented within finance costs.

**Foreign operations**

The results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency different from the
presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:

- assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the reporting date,

- income and expenses for each statement of profit or loss are translated at average exchange rates (unless
this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the
transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of transactions)
and,

- the translation adjustment resulting from the use of these different rates is included in other comprehensive
income

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and
liabilities of the foreign operation and translated accordingly.

Exchange rates applied in those consolidated financial statements are as follows:

**2.7. Current or non-current classification**

Assets are classified as current in the consolidated statement of financial position where recovery is expected
within 12 months of the reporting date. All assets where recovery is expected more than 12 months from the
reporting date and all deferred tax assets, goodwill and intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and
investments in associates and joint ventures are reported as non-current.

Liabilities are classified as current unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the
liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date. For provisions, where the timing of settlement is
uncertain, amounts are classified as non-current where settlement is expected more than 12 months from the
reporting date. In addition, deferred tax liabilities and employment benefits are reported as non-current.

**2.8. Financial instruments**

**Accounting policies**

Financial instruments (financial assets and financial liabilities) are recognised on the Group’s statement of
financial position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

**In thousands of EUR unless otherwise stated**

**2.** **Basis of preparation (continued)**

Amortised cost is the amount at which the financial instrument was recognised at initial recognition less any
principal repayments, plus accrued interest, and for financial assets less any allowance for expected credit
losses. Accrued interest includes amortisation of transaction costs deferred at initial recognition and of any
premium or discount to the maturity amount using the effective interest method. Accrued interest income
and accrued interest expense, including both accrued coupon and amortised discount or premium (including
fees deferred at origination, if any), are not presented separately and are included in the carrying values of the
related items in the consolidated statement of financial position.

**Financial instruments—initial recognition**

Financial instruments at fair value through profit and loss are initially recorded at fair value. All other financial
instruments are initially recorded at fair value adjusted for transaction costs. Fair value at initial recognition is
best evidenced by the transaction price. A gain or loss on initial recognition is only recorded if there is a
difference between fair value and transaction price which can be evidenced by other observable current market
transactions in the same instrument or by a valuation technique whose inputs include only data from
observable markets. After the initial recognition, an expected credit loss allowance is recognised for financial
assets measured at amortized cost and investments in debt instruments measured at fair value through other
comprehensive income, resulting in an immediate accounting loss.

All purchases and sales of financial assets that require delivery within the time frame established by regulation
or market convention (“regular way” purchases and sales) are recorded at trade date, which is the date on
which the Group commits to deliver a financial asset. All other purchases are recognised when the Group
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

**Financial assets—classification and subsequent measurement—measurement categories**

The Group classifies financial assets in the following measurement categories:

- Fair value through profit and loss,

- Fair value through other comprehensive income and

- Amortized cost.

The classification and subsequent measurement of debt financial assets depends on the Group’s business
model for managing the related assets portfolio and the cash flow characteristics of the asset.

**Financial assets—classification and subsequent measurement—business model**

The business model reflects how the Group manages the assets in order to generate cash flows—whether the
Group’s objective is:

- solely to collect the contractual cash flows from the assets (“hold to collect contractual cash flows”,) or

- to collect both the contractual cash flows and the cash flows arising from the sale of assets (“hold to collect
contractual cash flows and sell”) or,

- if neither of above is applicable, the financial assets are classified as part of “other” business model and
measured at fair value through profit and loss.

Business model is determined for a group of assets (on a portfolio level) based on all relevant evidence about
the activities that the Group undertakes to achieve the objective set out for the portfolio available at the date
of the assessment.

Where the business model is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows or to hold contractual cash flows
and sell, the Group assesses whether the cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest
(“SPPI”). Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining
whether their cash flows are consistent with the SPPI feature. In making this assessment, the Group considers


-----

**ADRIA MIDCO B.V. GROUP**

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**In thousands of EUR unless otherwise stated**

**2.** **Basis of preparation (continued)**

whether the contractual cash flows are consistent with a basic lending arrangement, i.e. interest includes only
consideration for credit risk, time value of money, other basic lending risks and profit margin.

Where the contractual terms introduce exposure to risk or volatility that is inconsistent with a basic lending
arrangement, the financial asset is classified and measured at fair value through profit and loss. The SPPI
assessment is performed on initial recognition of an asset and it is not subsequently reassessed.

Financial instruments are reclassified only when the business model for managing the portfolio as a whole
change. The reclassification has a prospective effect and takes place from the beginning of the first reporting
period that follows after the change in the business model.

**Financial assets—write-off**

Financial assets are written-off, in whole or in part, when the Group exhausted all practical recovery efforts
and has concluded that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. The write-off represents a derecognition
event. The Group may write-off financial assets that are still subject to enforcement activity when the Group
seeks to recover amounts that are contractually due, however, there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.

**2.9. New standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards mandatory for the first time for the**
**financial year beginning on 1 January 2020**

The Group has applied the following standards and amendments for the first time for their annual reporting
period commencing 1 January 2020:

- Definition of Materiality—amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8

- Definition of a Business—amendments to IFRS 3

- Interest Rate Benchmark Reform—amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7

- Revised Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting

- Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018–2020 Cycle.

- Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions—amendments to IFRS 16

The amendments listed above did not have any impact on the amounts recognised in prior periods and are not
expected to significantly affect the current or future periods.

**2.10. Standards issued but not yet effective**

Certain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for
31 December 2020 reporting periods and have not been early adopted by the Group:

- IFRS 17 “Insurance Contracts”(issued on 18 May 2017 and effective for annual periods beginning on or
after 1 January 2021).

- Classification of liabilities as current or non-current—Amendments to IAS 1 (issued on 23 January 2020
and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022)

- Classification of liabilities as current or non-current, deferral of effective date—Amendments to IAS 1
(issued on 15 July 2020 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023)

- Proceeds before intended use, Onerous contracts—cost of fulfilling a contract, Reference to the Conceptual
Framework—narrow scope amendments to IAS 16, IAS 37 and IFRS 3, and Annual Improvements to
IFRSs 2018-2020—amendments to IFRS 1, IFRS 9, IFRS 16 and IAS 41 (issued on 14 May 2020 and
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022)

These standards are not expected to have a material impact on the Group in the current or future reporting
periods and on foreseeable future transactions.

**3.** **Change of accounting policy**

This note explains the impact of the change of accounting policy for investment property on the Group’s
consolidated financial statements and also discloses the new accounting policies that have been applied from
1 January 2020, where they are different to those applied in prior periods.

Investment properties are properties held to earn rentals and/or for capital appreciation (including property
under construction for such purposes). Where the Group uses only insignificant portion of a property it owns
for supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes (utilization of less than 25% is regarded as
insignificant) the property is presented as an investment property.

Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. The cost of replacing part of
an existing investment property will be recognized in the carrying amount of an investment property at the
time that cost is incurred if the recognition criteria are met.

Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are stated at fair value in the consolidated financial
statements. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair values of investment properties are included in
profit or loss in Other income/Other operating expense in the period in which they arise.

An investment property is derecognized upon disposal or when the investment property is permanently
withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits are expected from the disposal. Any gain or loss arising
on derecognition of the property (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the
carrying amount of the asset) is included in profit or loss in the period in which the property is derecognized.

**Valuation technique and significant unobservable inputs**

The valuation technique used is Market comparison—the fair value is based on the market price of properties
with similar location and category. At the date of valuation, no active market existed and the market value
was determined based on the market comparable approach that reflects recent transaction prices for similar
properties. The transactions prices have been adjusted with: market indices to reflect the actual changes in the
offered price, based on the trends of actual transactions; adjustment coefficients, derived on the basis of
characteristics of the respective plots like size, environmental and geomorphologic condition, level of
development and transport accessibility, and improvements of the properties. The estimated fair value of the
individual properties would increase/ (decrease) had the respective market indices were higher/ (lower) and the
adjustments coefficients were higher/ (lower).

Prior to change of accounting policy in 2020, the Group measured investment property initially at cost,
including transaction costs. After initial measurement, investment property was measured in accordance with
requirements for cost model depreciating by straight line depreciation over useful life.

Management believes that application of the new policy would result in more reliable and relevant information
as significant acquisition occurred in 2020 (VIVACOM Group). Impact of change of accounting policy on
prior financial reports is assessed as not material and didn’t result in change of comparative period.

**4.** **Financial risk management**

This note presents information about the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and
managing credit, liquidity and market risk. Also presents the exposure and sensitivity of the Group to these
risks.

There is no change of financial risk and financial risk management compared to consolidated financial
statements as at 31 December 2019.

**ADRIA MIDCO B.V. GROUP**

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**4.** **Financial risk management (continued)**

The Group’s managing board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s
risk management framework, and development and monitoring of the Group’s risk management policies.

The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to
set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management
policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities.
The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to maintain a disciplined
and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.

The finance function monitors compliance with the Group’s risk management policies and procedures, and
provides top management with feedback regarding the performance of the framework in relation to the risk
faced by the Group.

**4.1. Credit risk**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument
fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers,
contract assets, cash and cash equivalents held at banks, loans and financial guarantees issued by the Group
and the indemnification asset.

4.1.1. Expected credit loss

The Group has financial assets classified and measured at amortised cost and fair value through other
comprehensive income that are subject to the expected credit loss model requirements of IFRS 9. Cash at
bank and in hand and certain other investments are both classified and measured at amortised cost and
subject to these impairment requirements. However, the identified expected credit loss is considered to be
immaterial.

The Group assesses, on a forward-looking basis, the expected credit loss for debt instruments measured at
amortized cost and fair value through other comprehensive income and for the exposures arising from loan
commitments and financial guarantee contracts, for contract assets. The Group measures expected credit loss
and recognises net impairment losses on financial and contract assets at each reporting date. The measurement
of expected credit loss reflects:

- an unbiased and probability weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible
outcomes,

- time value of money and

- all reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost and effort at the end of
each reporting period about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future conditions.

Debt instruments measured at amortized cost, trade and other receivables, loans issued and contract assets
are presented in the consolidated statement of financial position net of the allowance for expected credit loss.

The Group applies simplified approach for impairment of trade receivables without significant financing
component and contract assets. For other financial assets the Group applies a three-stage model for
impairment, based on changes in credit quality since initial recognition. A financial instrument that not had a
significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition or that have low credit risk at the reporting date is
classified in Stage 1. Financial assets in Stage 1 have their expected credit loss measured at an amount equal to
the portion of lifetime expected credit loss that results from default events possible within the next 12 months
or until contractual maturity, if shorter (“12 Months expected credit loss”). If the Group identifies a
significant increase in credit risk (“SICR”) since initial recognition, the asset is transferred to Stage 2 and its
expected credit loss is measured based on expected credit loss on a lifetime basis, that is, up until contractual
maturity but considering expected prepayments, if any (“Lifetime expected credit loss”). If the Group
determines that a financial asset is credit-impaired, the asset is transferred to Stage 3 and its expected credit
loss is measured as a Lifetime expected credit loss. For financial assets that are purchased or originated creditimpaired (“POCI Assets”), the expected credit loss is always measured as a Lifetime expected credit loss.

The non-recoverability analysis is conducted for the past 3 years to determine the general default ratio. In
order to determine the default rate for a given ageing interval, the balance of receivables written-off is
compared against the balance of outstanding receivables.

4.1.3. Trade and other receivables (including contract assets)

The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The Group assesses that it has no significant concentration of credit risk due to its exposure to a broad
customer base in each service line. No concentration of credit risk on a geographical basis is assessed as
material. The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure for each customer including services
disconnection procedure.

Customer credit risk is managed by the Group’s business units which each have policies, procedures and
controls relating to customer credit risk management. Outstanding trade receivables and contract assets are
regularly reviewed to monitor any changes in credit risk with concentrations of credit risk considered to be
limited given that the Group’s customer base is large and unrelated. The Group applies the simplified approach
and records lifetime expected credit losses for trade receivables and contract assets.

The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to
credit risk at the reporting date was:

Due to the large number of customers and the high level of diversification of the trade and other receivables,
including contract assets, the default of any single debtor would not impose any significant consequences in
respect of the consolidated financial statements. For trade receivables presented in bucket over nine months,
for which the Group have liabilities and legal right to offset them with receivables and receivables in the
amount of EUR 8,747 thousand from stated-owned company which the Group has assessed as collectable as
these will be reimbursed from state budget, no impairment has been recognized.

The contract assets are all not yet due as at 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019. The default rate
applied to calculated the expected credit loss in relation to contract assets is the same as applied to trade
receivables not due 0.4%–2.6% (2019: 0.2%–2.6%).

**Allowance for credit losses on other financial assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **(12,187)** **(12,187)**

Total amount of long-term loans relates to loan to Totalna Televizija d.o.o. At 31 December 2019 this loan is
considered as non-performing as principal repayments are more than 90 days past due and loss allowance is
based on lifetime expected credit loss.

Under Other financial assets, the Group reported indemnification asset for acquisition of VIVACOM Group
in the amount of EUR 49,237 thousand. Considering the fact that the full indemnification amount is
deposited at banks, the expected credit loss in relation to this indemnification asset as at 31 December 2020
was assessed as being not material (note 28).

4.1.5. Short term loans and deposits

A loss allowance in relation to short term loans and deposits is determined individually for each balance. In
order to assess credit risk publicly available information to determine default rates. No exposure to any
significant credit risk was identified, the calculation of the loss allowances resulted in immaterial amounts.

4.1.6. Cash and cash equivalents

The Group holds cash in a number of banks in order to avoid concentration risk. A loss allowance in relation
to cash and cash equivalents is determined individually for each balance with a given financial institution. In
order to assess credit risk, external credit ratings and publicly available information on default rates for a
given rating of Standard & Poor’s rating agency were used. As all cash balances have a low credit risk as at the
reporting date and comparative period, the Group applied the practical expedient available under IFRS 9 and
determined the loss allowances based on 12-month expected credit losses. The calculation of the loss
allowances resulted in an immaterial amount.

The Group held cash and cash equivalents of EUR 285,405 thousand as 31 December 2020
(31 December 2019: EUR 250,058 thousand) with reputable local commercial banks, which represents its
maximum credit exposure on these assets.

Management actively monitors credit risk exposure and given that the Group only has invested in bank
deposits management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.

**4.2. Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its
financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group’s approach to
managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its
liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or
risking damage to the Group’s reputation.

The Group’s policy on liquidity is to maintain sufficient liquid resources to meet its obligations as they fall
due, which has been achieved through appropriate bank arrangements (note 33). Typically, the Group seeks
to ensure that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected current liabilities as they fall due, including
the servicing of financial obligations; this excludes the potential impact of extreme circumstances that cannot
reasonably be predicted, such as natural disasters.

**4.3. Market risk**

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity
prices will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of
market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while
optimizing the return.

4.3.1. Currency risk

Currency risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognized assets or liabilities are denominated
in a currency that is not the functional currency of the Group entity holding the asset or obligation.

Different entities within the Group have different functional currencies, based on the underlying economic
conditions of their operations. Other than Euro, which is the Company’s functional currency, the Group’s
subsidiaries have local functional currencies: Serbian dinar (“RSD”), Croatian kuna (“HRK”), Bosnian
Konvertibilna marka (“BAM”), Bulgarian lev (“BGN”) and Swiss franc (“CHF”). The Bosnia Konvertibilna
marka and Bulgarian lev are pegged to the Euro. Accordingly, the main exposure to currency risk comes from
relates to purchases and borrowings which are denominated in Euros and US dollars, while a significant share
of the Group’s revenue is denominated in Serbian dinars, Swiss franc and Croatian kuna.

The Group has exposure to currency fluctuation (depreciation) of RSD (Serbian dinar) to Euro given that it
has significant operations through SBB Serbia for which RSD is the functional currency and that has
significant borrowings in Euro. The Group’s currency risk policy for this exposure is implemented through
regular price adjustments on the Serbian market, following the depreciation of Serbian dinar against Euro.

The following table presents sensitivities of profit or loss and equity to reasonably possible changes in
exchange rates to EUR applied at the end of the reporting period relative to the functional currency of the
respective Group entities, with all other variables held constant:

4.3.2. Price risk

The Group is not exposed to material price risks on its financial instruments.

4.3.3. Interest rate risk

The Group’s cash flow interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings, loans to related parties issued at
variable rates and lease liabilities, whereas the borrowings at the fixed rate are exposed to fair value risk
nevertheless it does not impact the financial statements as these borrowings are measured at amortised cost.
The Group closely monitors current market rates in order to minimize negative effects of significant
movements in market rates. The Group does not use these instruments for speculative purposes.

As at 31 December 2020, if interest rates on currency denominated borrowings (with floating rate) had been
1% higher with all other variables held constant, net profit for the year would have been EUR 7,416 thousand
lower (2019: EUR 4,289 thousand).

**4.4. Fair value hierarchy**

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The best evidence of fair value is the price
in an active market. An active market is one in which transactions for the asset or liability take place with
sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

Valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow models or models based on recent arm’s length transactions
or consideration of financial data of the investees are used to measure fair value of certain financial
instruments for which external market pricing information is not available. Fair value measurements are
analysed by level in the fair value hierarchy as follows:


-----

**ADRIA MIDCO B.V. GROUP**

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**In thousands of EUR unless otherwise stated**

**4.** **Financial risk management (continued)**

- level one are measurements at quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities,

- level two measurements are valuations techniques with all material inputs observable for the asset or liability,
either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices), and

- level three measurements are valuations not based on solely observable market data (that is, the
measurement requires significant unobservable inputs). Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy
are deemed to have occurred at the end of the reporting period.

The table below shows the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities,
including their levels in fair values hierarchy. It does not include information for financial assets and financial
liabilities not measured at fair value if the carrying amount if reasonable approximation of fair value.

The fair values of the Other financial liabilities—bonds are calculated by discounting the future cash flows to
net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at 31 December. The valuation basis is level 2.
This classification comprises items where fair value is determined from inputs other than quoted prices that
are observable for the liability, either directly or indirectly.

Due to the structure of long-term financing through leveraged buyout arrangement, the management policy
is to maintain a stable return on investment so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to
sustain future development of the business. The Group’s performance management is focused on generating
budgeted Adjusted EBITDA as well as maintaining overall liquidity position to repay the financial debt
(note 4). An important key performance indicator for the communication with investors, analysts, and rating
agencies is Pro Forma Net leverage (calculated as Adjusted Pro Forma Net Debt to Annualized Last Two
Quarters Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA). “Annualised” amounts are calculated by multiplying the amounts
for last two quarters by 2. This pro forma ratio stood at 4.7x at 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: 4.71x).

Annualized Last Two Quarters Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Pro Forma Net Debt are nonGAAP figures not governed by International Financial Reporting Standards, and their definition and
calculation may vary from one company to another. These measures are prepared by the Group on a Pro
Forma basis and present hypothetically the Group’s adjusted net debt and Annualised Last two Quarters
adjusted EBITDA as though the acquisition of VIVACOM Group (control obtained on 3 August 2020),
Forthnet Group (control obtained on 12 November 2020) and Nova Broadcasting Group (acquired on
22 January 2021) and other events and operations that are directly related to these acquisitions, had taken
place at 1 January 2020.

The unaudited/unreviewed pro forma been prepared solely for management purposes and due to its nature
presents a hypothetical situation; therefore, it does not present the actual results financial results, financial
standing, and any other financial measures of the Group for the presented periods, had the events and
operations discussed really taken place on the assumed dates, and its purpose is not to determine the actual
results and financial standing in any future periods.

The objective of the Group to keep Net leverage ratio below 5x as of the reporting date.

There is no change in respect of the capital management compared to consolidated financial statements as at
31 December 2019.

The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going
concern in order to provide returns for investors and to maintain an optimal liquidity position.

**6.** **Critical accounting estimates and judgments**

Judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial
statements and estimates that can cause a significant adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and
liabilities within the next financial year included:

**6.1. Revenue recognition**

Revenue recognition under IFRS 15 necessitates the collation and processing of very large amounts of data,
use of management judgements and estimates to produce financial information. The most significant
accounting judgements and source of estimation uncertainty are disclosed below.

6.1.1. Gross versus net presentation

The Group is the principal in the sale to the customer if the Group has control of the goods and services when
they are delivered to a customer; otherwise the Group is acting as an agent. Whether the Group is considered
to be the principal or an agent in the transaction depends on analysis by management of both the legal form
and substance of the agreement between the Group and its business partners; such judgements impact the
amount of reported revenue and operating expenses (see notes 8 and 9) but do not impact reported assets,
liabilities or cash flows. Scenarios requiring judgement to determine whether the Group is a principal or an
agent include, for example, those where the Group delivers advertising and media selling services. Please refer
to sections 8.3 and 8.4 for accounting policy.

6.1.2. Allocation of revenue to goods and services provided to customers

The Group is determining and allocating the transaction prices to separate performance obligations in the
contract; the allocation is based on the reference to their relative standalone selling prices that could be
obtained if the promised goods and services were sold individually in a separate transaction. The standalone


-----

**ADRIA MIDCO B.V. GROUP**

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**In thousands of EUR unless otherwise stated**

**6.** **Critical accounting estimates and judgments (continued)**

selling prices are determined based on the list prices at which the Group sells handsets and telecommunication
services, if sold separately.

**6.2. Business combinations and goodwill**

When the Group completes a business combination, the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities
acquired, including intangible assets, are recognised. The determination of the fair values of acquired assets
and liabilities is based, to a considerable extent, on management’s judgement. If the purchase consideration
exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired then the incremental amount paid is recognised as goodwill. If
the purchase price consideration is lower than the fair value of the assets acquired then the difference is
recorded as a gain in the income statement.

Allocation of the purchase price between property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill affects
the subsequent results of the Group as finite lived assets are amortised, whereas goodwill is not. Please refer
to note 23 for further information.

**6.3. Impairment of goodwill**

IFRS requires management to perform impairment tests annually for indefinite lived assets, for finite lived
assets and for equity accounted investments, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying
amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment testing requires management to judge whether the carrying
value of assets can be supported by the net present value of future cash flows that they generate. Calculating
the net present value of the future cash flows requires estimates to be made in respect of highly uncertain
matters including management’s expectations of:

- growth in Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in note 7),

- timing and amount of future capital expenditure;

- long-term growth rates; and

- discount rates to reflect the risks involved.

Management prepares formal five-year budget for the Group’s operations, which are used to estimate their
value in use. Changing the assumptions selected by management, in particular the adjusted EBITDA and
growth rate assumptions used in the cash flow projections, could significantly affect the Group’s impairment
evaluation and hence reported assets and profits or losses (note 19).

**6.4. Customer relationships**

The Group tests annually useful life of customer relationships based on management assumptions on
customer churn rates. An increase in churn rates may lead to a reduction in the estimated useful life and an
increase in the amortisation charge.

**6.5. Lease accounting**

Lease accounting under IFRS 16 increases use of management judgements and estimates to provide financial
information.

**6.6. Lease identification**

The Group exercises judgement to determine whether or not a contract contains a lease. In addition,
judgement is exercised to determine which incremental borrowing rate to apply to obtain the present value.

**6.7. Lease term**

In determining the lease term, management considers all fact and circumstances that create an economic
incentive to exercise an extension option, or not to exercise a termination option. The assessment is reviewed

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**In thousands of EUR unless otherwise stated**

**6.** **Critical accounting estimates and judgments (continued)**

if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs which affects this assessment and that is
within the control of the Group.

**6.8. Contingent liabilities**

The Group exercises judgement to determine whether to recognise provisions and the exposures to contingent
liabilities related to pending litigations or other outstanding claims subject to negotiated settlement,
mediation, arbitration or government regulation, as well as other contingent liabilities (Note 38). Judgement
is necessary to assess the likelihood that a pending claim will succeed, or a liability will arise.

**6.9. Expected credit loss**

The calculation and measurement of expected credit loss in relation to trade receivables and contract assets is
an area where significant judgement is required to select an appropriate methodology, models and data inputs.
Details of expected credit loss measurement methodology are disclosed in note 4 Expected credit losses. In
the calculation of the default rate, the Group’s models predominantly use historical information which is
derived from the Group’s systems of market data.

**7.** **Operating segments**

The Group is a pan regional distribution platform of cable and satellite Pay-TV, broadband internet and
telephony services with various offerings in Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia,
Greece, Montenegro and North Macedonia. Its business has grown substantially in terms of scale, geographic
reach and service offering during the period under review through both organic growth and acquisitions. In
addition, the corporate organization of the Group’s business has changed during this period as business has
grown and been integrated.

Segment information is provided partially on the basis of geographic areas and partially based on an
organizational structure, being the basis on which the Group manages its operations.

**Accounting policies**

An operating segment is a component of the Group:

- that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses that relate to
transactions with any of the Group’s other components,

- whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Makers (CODM)
and

- for which discrete financial information is available.

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the CODM.
CODM is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments.

Operating segments are components that engage in business activities that may earn revenues or incur expenses
as a result of the services provided. Operating results of segments are regularly reviewed by the CODM and
discrete financial information is available on that level. Revenue in telco segments is attributed to a country
based on the location of the sub-group reporting the revenue.

The functions of CODM are performed by the Managing directors of the Group.

The Group has seven operating segments in telecom and one in media business line, which are the Group’s
strategic divisions. Telecom strategic divisions for each of key markets, offer similar services and are managed
jointly since they have unified service development and marketing strategy. Media segment represents content
operating. For each of the strategic divisions, the CODM reviews internal management reports on at least
monthly basis. The reportable segments equal the operating segments thus no aggregation of operating
segments was performed for the reporting purposes.

operations in Macedonia account for minor part of the overall operations of Serbia Group segment,

- Bulgaria Group includes telecom operations in Bulgaria,

- Slovenia Group includes cable and DTH operations and mobile telephony services in Slovenia (note 23),

- Greece Group includes telecom and media operations in Greece (note 23),

- Bosnia Group includes cable and DTH operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina,

- Montenegro Group includes cable and DTH operations in Montenegro,

- Croatia Group includes mobile telephony services in Croatia (note 23),

- Other segments include our other operating business, such as Solford, Shoppster and non-operating holding
companies (United Group B.V., Adria Cable B.V., Adria Serbia Holdco B.V., Slovenia Broadband
S.A.R.L.). Revenue reported in other is mainly generated by Solford and Shoppster.

In 2020, the Group completed following acquisitions which represent separate segments:

- Telemach Hrvatska d.o.o., mobile operator in Croatia which represents separate segment Croatia Group.

- VIVACOM Group, telco operator in Bulgaria which represents Bulgaria Group.

- Forthnet Group, telco and media operator in Greece which represents Greece Group.

There were no changes in relation to composition of segments and measurement of segment profit/loss
comparing to consolidated financial statements for 2019.

Information regarding the results of each reportable segment is included below. Performance is measured
based on segment earnings before net finance cost, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and
Adjusted EBITDA, as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the Group’s
management.

EBITDA is a supplemental measure of financial performance that is not required by, or presented in
accordance with IFRS. “EBITDA” is defined by the Group as Profit/(Loss) for the period plus income tax
(benefit)/expense, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and net finance costs and share of profit/
loss of equity-accounted investee.

Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for shareholder-related costs, legal and advisory—M&A
related costs, group restructuring costs, income from the disposal of companies, impairment charges for
obsolete equipment in Slovenia, other management-related costs, specific penalties, additional impact of
application of new standards (just for transitory period) and other non-core operating expenses, which Group
views as non-operating and not recurring to the operations of the Group (note 17).

Segment Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (note 17) is used to measure performance as management
believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to
other entities that operate within these industries.

**7.1. Description of products and services from which each reportable segment derives its revenue**

The Group’s main activities are providing of Video, Data, Voice and Mobile services to subscribers in the
countries of South-East Europe. The Group operates in Serbia, Greece, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro
and North Macedonia providing Video, Data and Voice services. In Slovenia and Bulgaria in addition to
Video, Data and Voice provides mobile phone services. In Croatia providing mobile phone services.

**7.** **Operating segments (continued)**

Video service include provision of TV channel mix and IP Video streaming services, which is marketed into
basic, extended and premium packages. TV mix range from 60 to over 100 TV channels.

Data service comprise internet packages for residential and business customers, as well as various
supplementary services for business customers (connectivity and managed services, data centre and cloud
services).

Voice service relates to fixed line services to residential and business customers.

Mobile phone services relate to post-paid, prepaid, roaming and wholesale services provided to customers.

United Media is the leading media company in South East Europe, broadcasting more than 30 channels
available for terrestrial, cable, DTH, OTT and IPTV platforms. Content operations are driven by carriage fee
revenues which are coming from sales of pay-tv channel to cable operators across Adriatic region and
advertising revenue from both terrestrial TV stations and pay-TV stations. The Group is the owner of pay-tv
channels including flagship brands like “Sport Klub”, regional news channel ‘N1’, general entertainment
channel Nova S, movie channel “Cinemania”, children channels “Pikaboo” and “Vavoom” and music
channels “Grand” and “IDJ”, as well as terrestrial TV stations Nova TV and Doma TV in Croatia, Nova M
in Montenegro and Nova BH in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Recently, United Media started to invest heavily in
its digital portfolio, out of which the most prominent web portals are dnevnik.hr (number 1 portal in Croatia),
n1info.com and nova.rs. In addition to this, Direct Media group, a leading media-buying agency, provides
advertising and media services to companies in the region.

**7.2. Factors that management used to identify the reportable segments**

Most of the Group’s business segments are mainly based on the Group’s geographic regions, Serbia, Bulgaria,
Slovenia, Greece, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Montenegro, and the other business segment is
broadly based on product distribution. They are managed separately because each business unit requires
different marketing strategies and service level.

**7.3. Measurement of operating segment profit or loss**

The CODM reviews financial information prepared based on IFRS adjusted to meet the requirements of
internal reporting. Such financial information differs in certain aspects from IFRS:

- Management consolidation adjustments can differ from the ones required by IFRS;

- non-IFRS profit measures (such as earnings before income tax, depreciation and amortization—EBITDA,
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Capital Expenditure (Adjusted CAPEX)) are also included in the segment
report. Adjusted CAPEX represents purchases of tangible and intangible assets, consisting primarily of set
top box purchases and other customer capital expenditure, installations (including capitalized labour costs),
cable and mobile network build out, upgrades, maintenance and other investments, computer hardware
and software and content rights.

CODM evaluates performance of each segment based on revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA and other
key performance indicators (e.g. average revenue per user, CAPEX) and does not regularly review assets and
liabilities of the segments.

**7.4. Information about reportable segment statement of comprehensive income**

**8.** **Revenue**

**Accounting policies**

The Group’s process for revenue recognition from multi-element contracts (e.g. mobile service and handset)
consists of:

     - assessment of all goods and services provided to the subscriber under the contract and identifying separate
performance obligations in that contract,

     - determining and allocating the transaction prices to separate performance obligations in the contract; the
allocation is based on the reference to their relative standalone selling prices that could be obtained if the
promised goods and services were sold individually in a separate transaction.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**8.** **Revenue (continued)**

In determining the transaction price, the Group shall adjust the promised amount of consideration for the
effects of the time value of money if the timing of payments agreed to by the parties to the contract (either
explicitly or implicitly) provides the customer or the entity with a significant benefit of financing the transfer
of goods or services to the customer. In those circumstances, the contract contains a significant financing
component. However, based on the management analysis and considered factors noted in IFRS 15.61, at
present, the financing component is considered to be immaterial of handset and would not materially change
the amount of revenue that should be recognized in relation to a contract with a customer and thus, there is
no need to determine the present value of future cash flows from handset to calculate the initial value of the
contract asset. The Group will continue to monitor contract offerings and mobile business models.

**8.1. Subscription fee revenues**

Revenue from subscription services consists primarily of monthly fees paid by subscribers for provision of
telecommunication service. These revenues are recognized within the profit or loss in proportion to the length
service provided (subscription fee) over time in the period when related services are rendered.

The Group generates following main subscription-based service revenue streams which are recognized in the
period when the service is provided: Cable TV (CATV), Digital TV (D3), cable and fibre Internet service,
satellite TV (Direct to Home—DTH) and mobile telephony service.

Revenues from the rendered services relate to mobile services containing amounts charged to post-paid plan
customers for monthly service fees, which includes: voice, data and SMS.

Based on IFRS 15, revenue should follow performance and not timing of payment, as the Group has
obligation to provide service to the customer. The revenue is recognized over time and only to the extent of
provided service, and remaining of the consideration received is deferred. Mobile phone service is a “stand
ready obligation” and the obligation is satisfied by passage of time so the fixed monthly fee is spread straight
line over the time of the contract. The fee charged additionally for telephone conversation and SMS is a
variable consideration which is recognized as revenue when the even usage giving rise to such fee occurs.

Handsets subsidized represents a distinct performance obligation and realization of revenues to each
performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis is required. The subsidy of the hardware
leads to the recognition of a contract asset under IFRS 15. The total consideration allocated to this
performance obligation based on the relative stand- alone selling prices of performance obligations within
this contract and amount accrued at this point is recognised as contract asset. The IFRS 15 adjustment results
in revenue recognition from the sale of hardware at the contract inception and the recognition of contract
asset in the balance sheet. During the minimum contract duration (e.g. two years) contract asset is settled
from the monthly service fee paid by the customer.

The Group uses the practical expedient under IFRS 15 and recognizes fee from voice, data and SMS in the
amount to which the Group has a right to invoice.

**8.2. Carriage fees**

Carriage fee revenue relates to sales of pay-tv channel to other cable operators. The Group is the owner of
pay-tv channels including brands like “Sport Klub”, regional news channel ‘N1’, general entertainment
channel Nova S, movie channel “Cinemania”, children channels “Pikaboo” and “Vavoom” and music
channels “Grand” and “IDJ”, as well as terrestrial TV stations Nova TV and Doma TV in Croatia, Nova M
in Montenegro and Nova BH in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Revenue is recognized over the time, depending on a contract, either on straight-line basis over the sales
contract period when the fixed fee is contracted or number of subscribers multiplied by agreed price per user.

**8.3. Advertising revenue**

Advertising revenue is derived primarily from broadcasting of advertising content and is recognized over the
time when the advertising is broadcast. Revenue is recognized in profit or loss in the amount due from

customers net of value added tax and any rebates granted, which is highly probable that it will not be reversed.
Please refer to note 6.1 for information on critical estimates and judgements.

**8.4. Media selling**

Media selling revenue relates to selling of advertising space in any communication platform, such as
newspapers, magazines, outdoor billboards and screens, event sponsorship, commercial radio or television,
business information/data and online/digital. The Group acts as principal in media selling (note 6). Media
selling revenue is recognized over the time of providing the service. Please refer to note 6.1 for information on
critical estimates and judgements.

**8.5. Revenue from sale of end user equipment**

Revenue from sale of end user equipment is recognized at point in time when the control is transferred to the
buyer which usually is the moment when the customer obtains the end user equipment. End user equipment
mainly relates to handsets.

**8.6. Other revenue**

Other revenue mainly arises from lease of cable network and represents lease component accounted for under
IFRS 16, revenue from digital distribution, other media related service and other services from customers.

**16. Income tax**

Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. It is recognized in profit or loss except to the extent
that it relates to items recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.

Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates
enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of
previous years. Current tax payable also includes any tax liability arising from the declaration of dividends.

The prevailing corporate tax rates are:

The Group applies IFRIC 23 in assessment of uncertain tax position. The Group determines whether to
consider each uncertain tax treatment separately or together with one or more other uncertain tax treatments
based on which approach better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty. In determining the approach that
better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty, an entity might consider, for example, (a) how it prepares its
income tax filings and supports tax treatments; or (b) how the entity expects the taxation authority to make its
examination and resolve issues that might arise from that examination.

In assessing whether and how an uncertain tax treatment affects the determination of taxable profit (tax loss),
tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates, the Group assumes that a taxation authority will
examine amounts it has a right to examine and have full knowledge of all related information when making
those examinations. When the Group concludes it is probable that the taxation authority will accept an

**16. Income tax (continued)**

uncertain tax treatment, the entity shall determine the taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses,
unused tax credits or tax rates consistently with the tax treatment used or planned to be used in its income tax
filings.

When the Group concludes it is not probable that the taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax
treatment, the Group reflects the effect of uncertainty in determining the related taxable profit (tax loss), tax
bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits or tax rates. The Group reflects the effect of uncertainty for each
uncertain tax treatment by using either of the following methods, depending on which method the entity
expects to better predict the resolution of the uncertainty:

- the most likely amount—the single most likely amount in a range of possible outcomes. The most likely
amount may better predict the resolution of the uncertainty if the possible outcomes are binary or are
concentrated on one value.

- the expected value—the sum of the probability-weighted amounts in a range of possible outcomes. The
expected value may better predict the resolution of the uncertainty if there is a range of possible outcomes
that are neither binary nor concentrated on one value.

When uncertain tax treatment affects current tax and deferred tax (for example, if it affects both taxable
profit used to determine current tax and tax bases used to determine deferred tax), the Group makes consistent
judgements and estimates for both current tax and deferred tax.

**16. Income tax (continued)**

SBB is eligible for investment incentives (tax holiday) according to Article 50a to 50i Serbian Corporate
Income Tax (CIT). For SBB this is a second use of this type of investment tax credit. The company met
required conditions to use an investment tax credit for the second time in 2016. The investment tax credit is
applied for ten years. Start of investment in fixed assets for the second investment tax credit is 1 January 2016.
Each year the proportion for this investment needs to be calculated. Calculation of this percentage represent
the ratio of investment in fixed assets that meet requirements from Serbian CIT art 50a to 50i (certain assets
need to be excluded such as aircraft and watercrafts, passenger cars, furniture and assets that hasn’t been paid
during the cumulative period) and total investment in fix assets (for period from 1 January 2016—according
to invested amount in fixed assets and for previous period according to fixed amount of assets book value).
The percentage which can be apply as investment tax credit on calculated CIT is changing every year.

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of tax losses, because it is more likely than not that
future taxable profit will not be available against which the Group can use the benefits therefrom. Overview of

**18. Property, plant and equipment**

**Accounting policies**

Property, plant and equipment comprise mainly cable network (coaxial and optical primary and secondary
network and backbone) and customer premise equipment (CPE—receivers and modems). Items of property,
plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.

Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of selfconstructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to
bringing the assets to a working condition for their intended use, the costs of dismantling and removing the
items and restoring the site on which they are located and capitalized borrowing costs. Purchased software
that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalized as part of that equipment.

When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as
separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.

The gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined by comparing the
proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of the property, plant and equipment, and is recognized net
within other income or other operating expenses in profit or loss.

**18.1.** **Subsequent costs**

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate,
only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the
cost of the item can be measured reliably. Cost of replacing major parts or components of property, plant and
equipment items are capitalised and depreciated over shorter of remaining useful life of an asset or period
until major part are replaced again. Cost of the replaced part is retired. All other repairs and maintenance are
recognized in profit or loss during the financial period in which they are incurred.

**18.2.** **Depreciation**

Depreciation is based on the depreciable amount of an asset. Significant components of individual assets are
assessed and if a component has a useful life that is different from the remainder of that asset, that component
is depreciated separately.

Depreciation is recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each
component of an item of property, plant and equipment. The estimated useful lives for the current and
comparative periods are as follows:

**18.3.** **Impairment of property plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

The impairment losses recognized in respect of property, plant and equipment may be reversed in a later
period if the recoverable amount becomes greater than the carrying value, within the limit of impairment
losses previously recognized. Impairment losses are recognized in the statement of profit or loss. Assets that
suffered impairment, are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.

**18.4.** **Capital commitments**

During the period ended 31 December 2020, the Group entered into agreement to buy property, plant and
equipment for EUR 44,654 thousand (31 December 2019: EUR 4,479 thousand). Delivery is expected during
2021.

**19. Goodwill**

**Accounting policies**

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition (as defined in the note 23) over the fair value of
the identifiable net assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is measured at cost
less accumulated impairment losses.

An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset’s or CGU’s carrying amount exceeds its
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in

**19. Goodwill (continued)**

use. This impairment test is performed to compare the recoverable amount of each Cash Generating Unit
(CGU) or, if necessary in cases of goodwill, CGU to the carrying value of the CGU (including goodwill, if
goodwill has been allocated to CGU or group of CGUs). A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets
that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of
assets.

The value in use of each asset or group of assets is determined as the discounted value of future cash flows
(Discounted Cash Flow method (DCF)) by using cash flow projections consistent with the budget of the
following year, the most recent forecasts prepared by the operating segments and long-term projections.

Applied discount rates are determined by reference to available external sources of information, usually based
on financial institutions’ benchmarks, and reflect the current assessment by the Group of the time value of
money and risks specific to each asset or group of assets. Perpetual growth rates used for the evaluation of
CGUs are those used to prepare budgets for each CGU or group of CGUs, and beyond the period covered,
are consistent with growth rates estimated by the business by extrapolating growth rates used in the budgets,
without exceeding the long-term average growth rate for the markets in which the group operates. The fair
value (less costs to sell) is the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or group of assets in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, less costs to sell. These values are
generally determined on the basis of market data (stock market prices or comparison with similar listed
companies, with the value attributed to similar assets or companies in recent transactions) or, in the absence
of such data, on the basis of discontinued cash flows. If the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying
value of an asset or group of assets, an impairment loss equal to the difference is recognized in statement of
profit and loss. In the case of a group of assets, this impairment loss is first recorded against goodwill.
Impairment losses recognized in respect of goodwill cannot be reversed at a later date.

CGUs are independently defined at each business level, corresponding to the group operating segments. An
impairment test of goodwill is performed by the Group for each CGU or group of CGUs, depending on the
level at which management measures return on operations.

primarily with the acquisition of the Slovenia Broadband business in 2014, acquisitions of Direct Media
Group and Nova TV in 2018 and acquisitions of VIVACOM Group, Telemach Hrvatska d.o.o. and Forthet
Group in 2020.

**Impairment testing for goodwill**

In 2021, the Group tested the value of goodwill allocated to its CGUs or groups of CGUs applying valuation
methods consistent with previous years. Results of an impairment test show that the recoverable amount of
CGU or groups of CGUs tested exceeded their carrying value (including goodwill), except for the Montenegro
Group where the impairment of EUR 890 was recognised. The recoverable amount is determined as the
higher of the value in use determined by the discounted value of future cash flows (Discounted Cash Flow
method (DCF)) and the fair value (less costs to sell), determined on the basis of market data (stock market
prices, comparable listed companies, comparison with the value attributed to similar assets or companies in
recent acquisition transactions).

Definition of the Group’s CGU or group of CGUs correlates to the Group’s operating segment.

The recoverable amount of each operating segment is determined using value-in-use calculations. These
calculations use post-tax cash flow projections based on five-year financial budget. Cash flow beyond the
five-year period is calculated on a perpetuity basis. The post -tax cash flows were discounted using the posttax rate to ensure consistency.

Based on analysis, Montenegro Group would not be able to grow with the growth rates expected in the past.
As a result of impairment testing. impairment of goodwill in Montenegro in the amount of
EUR 890 thousand was recorded in 2020.

(1) Weighted average cost of capital, calculated on post-tax basis

WACC is calculated as weighted average of post-tax cost of equity and post-tax cost of debt, using peer
groups’ capital structure as weights, betas used are post-tax and based on industry reports as of
31 December 2020 and leveraged by the debt margin taken from comparable companies. Assumptions used
for value-in-use calculations (refer to the above table) changed to reflect current business environment as more
information became available to the Group.

The cash flow projections included specific estimates for five years and a terminal growth rate thereafter,
except for Forthnet Group where extended period was included in order to normalize cash flows in years 2026
to 2030 to converge to profitability of the market participant within 5 years. The terminal growth rate was
determined based on management’s estimate of the long-term compound annual Adjusted EBITDA growth
rate, consistent with the assumptions that a market participant would make.

Budgeted Adjusted EBITDA was estimated considering past experience, adjusted as follows:

- Revenue growth was projected considering the growth levels over the past three years and market research
for the relevant markets, competitive environment and management strategy for the next five years.

- Corporate costs not included in individual CGU. Therefore, it shows the cash outflows from the continuing
use of the assets.

**Sensitivity analysis**

The management has identified that there are no reasonably possible changes in a key business and valuation
assumptions in Bulgaria Group, Serbia Group, Slovenia Group and Croatia Group which could cause the
carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount.

For Greece Group, if WACC would increase for 1.5% carrying amount would exceed the recoverable amount
by EUR 11,447 thousand.

For Bosnia Group, if WACC would increase for 2% carrying amount would exceed the recoverable amount
by EUR 3,998 thousand.

For Media Group, if WACC would increase for 1.5% carrying amount would exceed the recoverable amount
by EUR 1,660 thousand.

**20. Intangible assets**

**Accounting policies**

Intangible assets that are acquired by the Group and have finite useful lives are measured at cost less
accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**In thousands of EUR unless otherwise stated**

**20. Intangible assets (continued)**

Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when satisfy the conditions for recognition as an asset. All other
expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands, is recognized in profit or loss
as incurred.

**Trademarks**

Trademarks are acquired in a business combination, recognized at fair value at the acquisition date.
Trademarks are amortized over their useful lives.

Trademarks include following trade names: “SBB”, “Total TV”, “Telemach”, “Sport Klub”, “Nova TV”,
“Direct Media”, Vivacom and Nova (Greece).

**Customer relationships**

Customer relationships acquired in a business combination are recognized at fair value at the acquisition date.
The customer relations have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and
accumulated impairment losses.

**Radio frequency rights**

Property rights relates to rights to radio frequencies for mobile services. The company uses the cost model and
thus manages intangible assets at their purchase values less depreciation adjustments following the straightline amortization method. Any intangible assets that meet the conditions for recognition are valued at cost
upon initial recognition. Property rights are amortized in a period of 2–10 years.

Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when satisfy the conditions for recognition as an asset. All other
expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands, is recognized in profit or loss
as incurred.

**Computer software**

Costs associated with maintaining computer software are recognized as an expense as incurred. Software is
recognized at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment. Cost includes expenditure to
acquire software and directly attributable costs to prepare it for its intended use.

Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software
products controlled by the Group are recognized as intangible assets when the relevant criteria are satisfied:

- the technical feasibility of completing the software so that it will be available for use or sale.

- its intention to complete the software and use or sell it.

- its ability to use or sell the software.

- how the software will generate probable future economic benefits

- the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use
or sell the software.

- its ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the software during its development.

Directly attributable costs, capitalized as part of the software product, includes software development
employee cost and appropriate portion of relevant overheads. Other development expenditures that do not
meet these criteria are recognized as an expense as incurred. Development costs previously recognized as an
expense are not recognized as an asset in a subsequent period. Computer software development costs
recognized as assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.

**20. Intangible assets (continued)**

**Subscriber acquisition cost**

Subscriber acquisition costs include additional costs associated with entering into sales contracts with new
customers, for example commissions paid to internal or external sales personnel. Subscriber acquisition costs
are recognized only for costs that are incremental to obtaining the contract.

**Programming rights**

When entering into contracts for the acquisition of film, series, shows or sports events, the rights acquired are
classified as contractual commitments. The Group assesses each license agreement which span over period
longer than one year whether it meets definition of an intangible asset and recognition criteria. They are
recorded in the statement of financial position and classified as programming rights as follows:

- Programming rights for films and television series are recognized at cost when the program is available for
screening and are expensed over their broadcasting period.

- Sports rights are recognized at cost at the opening of the broadcasting period of the related sports season
start or contract date if season start is not defined in the contract itself. If the licence agreement spans over
more than one year, the Group will recognize programming rights only to the level of assets available for
broadcasting (e.g. one season).

- Own-produced programming rights are capitalized on the balance sheet at cost which are directly related to
the project being developed such as direct external development costs, allocated costs of employees and
development overhead pool directly attributable to preparing the asset for use and will be amortized based
on program viewership forecast method

Advance payments for acquired programming assets, prior to licence begin date, are recognized as
prepayments for programming assets.

Signed and binding contracts for purchase of programming, which do not meet recognition criteria for
programming assets are not recognized in the balance sheet and are instead disclosed as contractual
commitments in the amount of the outstanding contract liability at the reporting date.

**Amortization**

Amortization is based on the depreciable amount of an asset and is calculated using straight-line method
(except for own-produced programming rights, see below) to allocate their cost over their estimated useful
lives.

Useful life of these assets is presented in table below:

**Number of years**

**20. Intangible assets (continued)**

The amortization charge for programming rights for each period are recognized in profit or loss statement as
amortization of programming rights.

Amortization methods and useful lives are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate.

**Impairment of intangible assets**

Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount may not be recoverable.

The impairment losses recognized in respect of intangible assets may be reversed in a later period if the
recoverable amount becomes greater than the carrying value, within the limit of impairment losses previously
recognized. Impairment losses are recognized in the statement of profit or loss. Assets that suffered
impairment, are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.

**Assets provided as security for loans**

As at 31 December 2020 revolving facility is guaranteed by pledge on trademarks (“SBB” and “Total TV”).

**22. Right of use and lease liability**

The Group recognises new assets and liabilities for its operating leases of satellite, office facilities, part of
infrastructure, as well base stations and the right of use of a water and land surface.

**Accounting policies**

A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys a right to control the use of an identified asset for a
period of time in exchange of consideration.

Leases are recorded as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is
available for use by the Group.

Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis.

Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments for the right of use the underlying
asset during the lease term:

- Fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentive receivable;

- Variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate;

- Amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;

- The exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option;

- Payment of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option.

The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be determined,
otherwise the Group’s incremental borrowing rate is applied. Weighted average incremental borrowing rates
used in 2020 was 5.2%.

There are recognition exemptions for short-term leases and leases of low-value items available on the voluntary
basis. The Group has elected to apply those exemption therefore the payments associated with all short-term
leases and leases of a low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss.
Short term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT-equipment,
computers, mobile phones etc.

Right-of-use assets are measured initially comprising the following:

- The amount of the initial measurement of lease liability,

- Any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentive received,

- Any initial direct costs,

- Restoration costs.

Subsequently, the right-of-use asset measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated
impairment losses, and adjusted for reassessment of the lease liability due to reassessment or lease
modifications. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term
on a straight-line basis.

loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the
liability for each period.

**23. Business combinations**

**Accounting policies**

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the business combination
is measured as the fair value of the aggregate consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair
value, fair value of any previously held interest and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquired
entity. For each business combination, any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity is measured either at
their proportionate share of the acquired entity’s identifiable net assets at the acquisition date or fair value.
Consideration transferred includes any contingent consideration measured at its acquisition date fair value.
The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships.
Such amounts are generally recognized in the statement of comprehensive income.

Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability
will be recognized in accordance with IFRS 9 either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive
income. Contingent consideration that qualifies for classification as equity is not re-measured until it is finally
settled. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed.

Any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the identifiable net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill in
the consolidated statement of financial position. If the cost is lower than the identifiable net assets acquired,
the difference is recognized in profit or loss.

Please refer to note 6.2 for information on critical estimates and judgements.

After the date of acquisition, the newly acquired companies contributed consolidated revenue of the Group
in total amount of EUR 439,793 thousand and consolidated net profit in total amount of
EUR 26,310 thousand. Following table summarizes effects of acquired companies on consolidated revenue
and net profit.

If all acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2020, management estimates that consolidated revenue would
have been EUR 1,727,163 thousand, and consolidated loss for the period would have been EUR 60,358
thousand. In determining these amounts, management has assumed that the fair value adjustments that arose
on the date of acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2020.

Decision on acquisition of the companies is made based on their high growth potential with number of
opportunities for cross selling and additional services to existing and new customers. Synergies implied by
high value of goodwill are realizing through the significant increase of Adjusted EBITDA, growing customer
database and average revenue per customer.

The Group incurred acquisition-related costs in the amount of EUR 568 thousand on legal fees and due
diligence costs for acquisitions in 2019, which have been included in other operating expenses.

The identification and valuation of identifiable intangible assets and property, plant and equipment involved
management judgment and was performed with the assistance of valuation experts.

**27. Contract assets and liabilities**

The contract assets arise mainly from:

- the sales of the subsidised handsets—the revenue is recognised when the customer obtains the handset
whereas the payment is obtained over the period for which the customer has committed the mobile services
which usually is two years.

- uneven payments relating to discounts provided to customers, including free services rendered for contract
commitments (e.g. free add-ons given to customers at contract inception for the duration unequal to
minimum contract duration (MCD)). This service is expected to be delivered the customer for the duration
agreed at contract inception and represents a dissimilar separate performance obligation which is not
delivered concurrently with main services throughout the MCD,

- services provided but not billed (accrued revenue at reporting date).The contract assets are transferred to
receivables when the rights become unconditional. This usually occurs when the Group issues an invoice to
the customer.

The contract liability is mainly recognised in relation to advertising, media selling, carriage fee and
subscription due to payments received at the inception of the contract whereas the revenue is recognised over
time.

**32. Provisions**

**Accounting policies**

A provision is a liability recognized in the statement of financial position, when the Group has a present
obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of past events; it is more likely than not that an outflow of
resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are not
recognized for future operating losses.

Provisions are measured at the managements’best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation
at the reporting date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material. Where the timing of
settlement is uncertain amounts are classified as non-current where settlement is expected more than
12 months from the reporting date.

The main provisions the Group holds are related to decommissioning costs associated with mobile sites,
which include the cost of returning network infrastructure sites to their original condition at the end of the
lease and claims for legal and regulatory matter.

**32.1.** **Decommissioning**

A provision has been recognised for decommissioning costs associated with mobile sites. The provision has
been capitalized to the cost of the sites with the amount of the present value of the expected decommissioning
obligation after ceasing operation. The discount rates used for 2020 and 2019 were between 0.6% and 1.1%.
The associated cash outflows are substantially expected to occur at the dates of decommissioning of the
assets to which they relate, and are long term in nature.

**32.2.** **Legal and regulatory**

The Group is involved in a number of legal and other disputes, including notifications of possible claims. The
management, after taking legal advice, have established provisions after taking into accounts the facts of each
case. For a discussion of certain legal issues potentially affecting the Group see note 38.

**33. Borrowings and bonds**

**Accounting policies**

Loans and borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred, and are
subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

Transaction costs are incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, issue or disposal of a
financial instrument. An incremental cost is one that would not have been incurred if the transaction had not
taken place. Transaction costs include fees and commissions paid to agents (including employees acting as
selling agents), advisors, brokers and dealers, levies by regulatory agencies and securities exchanges, and
transfer taxes and duties. Transaction costs do not include debt premiums or discounts, financing costs or
internal administrative or holding costs.

The effective interest method is a method of allocating interest income or interest expense over the relevant
period, so as to achieve a constant periodic rate of interest (effective interest rate) on the carrying amount.

**33. Borrowings and bonds (continued)**

The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts
(excluding future credit losses) through the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, if
appropriate, to the gross carrying amount of the financial instrument. The effective interest rate discounts
cash flows of variable interest instruments to the next interest repricing date, except for the premium or
discount which reflects the credit spread over the floating rate specified in the instrument, or other variables
that are not reset to market rates. Such premiums or discounts are amortised over the whole expected life of
the instrument. The present value calculation includes all fees paid or received between parties to the contract
that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. For assets that are purchased or originated credit impaired
(“POCI”) at initial recognition, the effective interest rate is adjusted for credit risk, i.e. it is calculated based on
the expected cash flows on initial recognition instead of contractual payments.

Upon origination of the bonds and RCF, transaction costs were included in the financial liabilities recognized.
Interest expense recorded includes amortization of these transaction costs deferred at initial recognition to
maturity amount using the effective interest method. Amortized transaction costs are not presented separately
and is included in the carrying values of the borrowings (as a reducing item).

The Group does not have qualifying asset for capitalised borrowing costs, therefore no borrowing costs were
capitalized to the value of property, plant and equipment as at 31 December 2020.

**35. Deferred tax assets and liabilities (continued)**

- taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax assets are recognized for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary
differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can
be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no
longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they
reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities
and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on
different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets
and liabilities will be realized simultaneously.

**37. Related parties**

In considering each possible related party relationship, attention is focused on the substance of the
relationship, not merely the legal form.

**37.3.** **Transactions with key management personnel**

During the period ended 31 December 2020, total compensation paid to directors for their services is made up
of a contractual salary and a performance bonus depending on operating results. Total directors’
compensation amounted to EUR 3,960 thousand (2019: EUR 3,099 thousand). There are no postemployment and termination benefits for the members of the management.

Key management personnel obtain also the Long-term incentive bonus described below.

**37.4.** **Guarantee**

The Group had guaranteed a loan of the other related party Gerrard Aircraft GMBH (31 December 2019:
EUR 2,814 thousand) which expired on 13 April 2020.

**37.5.** **Long Term Incentive Scheme**

On 16 May 2018, the shareholders of ultimate holding company, Adria Luxco S.a r.l. (Adria Luxco), entered
into a Long-Term Incentive Scheme (the “LTIS Agreement”) pursuant to which certain members of
management will be compensated in an amount determined by reference to the performance of the
shareholders of Adria Luxco in the event of any exit of their investment in Adria Luxco or Group by those
shareholders. The Agreement provided a platform for a reasonable expectation of the management to be
awarded based on the performance of the shareholders in the event of any exit of their investment in Adria
Luxco or the Group by those shareholders.

General Terms and Conditions of the LTIS Agreement included:

- an obligation of the shareholders of Adria Luxco, conditioned upon a predetermined accumulated return
on invested capital (measured by money-multiple and internal rate of return tests) in the event of any exit of
their investment in Adria Luxco or Group, to award a bonus payment to existing management of the
Group;

- the amount of the bonus payment calculated as a percentage of the proceeds received by the shareholders
of Adria Luxco and based on above mentioned accumulated return on invested capital achieved by such
shareholders;

**ADRIA MIDCO B.V. GROUP**

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**In thousands of EUR unless otherwise stated**

**37. Related parties (continued)**

- the payment of exit proceeds earmarked for the bonus payment is to be made by each shareholder to an
intermediary vehicle in cash within 30 days of receipt of such exit proceeds, with no recourse to the Group,
including the ultimate holding company Adria Luxco; no stock options or other derivative financial
instruments are part of the LTIS Agreement;

- no company in the Group, including the ultimate holding company Adria Luxco, has any obligation under
the LTIS Agreement to settle the bonus payment to the management. The LTIS is funded/settled in its
entirety by the Group’s external shareholders.

On 27 September 2018, Summer Bidco B.V., an entity controlled by Funds advised by BC Partners, entered
into a share purchase agreement (“SPA”) to acquire the entire share capital (excluding treasury shares) of
Adria Topco BV (the “Target”) from Adria Luxco S.a.r.l. (the “Seller”). The consummation of the Group
Acquisition pursuant to the Group Share Purchase Agreement which was subject to the satisfaction of certain
conditions, including clearance by competition authorities concluded on 4 March 2019. The consummation
of the Group acquisition represented an Exit under the LTIS Agreement.

The Group has recognized the effects of the LTIS Agreement in its consolidated financial statements for the
period ending 31 December 2019, as equity-settled Group Share-based payment transaction under IFRS 2—
Share-based payment—as LTIS Agreement is structured in a Group context where multiple Group entities
receive services from employees. It also provides the responsibility of shareholders to settle the bonus (sharebased payment) to employees who are providing services to several group companies.

The bonus amount under the LTIS Agreement at closing amounted to EUR 54,468 thousand, which relates
to the period of services provided from the LTIS Agreement signing to the grant date when all parties will
have shared understanding of key conditions pertaining LTIS Agreement. The service period ended
31 August 2019. The Group recognized in its consolidated financial statements for the period ending
30 September 2019 and 31 December 2019 related expense in the amount of EUR 21,659 thousand and
EUR 21,659 thousand, retrospectively which corresponds to the eligible managers’ period of service from
LTIS Agreement signing to the end of the reporting period.

From the perspective of the Group financial performance for the periods ending 30 September 2019 and
31 December 2019, the recognition of the transaction resulted in a lower reported net profit of the Group, in
the amount of EUR 21,659 thousand and EUR 21,659 thousand, retrospectively. The same amounts of
EUR 21,659 thousand and EUR 21,659 thousand, retrospectively, as guided by IFRS 2, the Group recognized
an increase in equity (Contribution from shareholder). The transaction is a non-cash, no recourse transaction
without an impact on the financial position of the Group.

**37.6.** **Additional payment**

In addition to the LTIS Agreement, the shareholders of Adria Luxco and management have agreed an
additional payment for 2019 in the amount of 49,9 million EUR. The amount of the additional payment was
not directly related to the value of the Company’s equity, or that of its ultimate parent, and was not paid in
securities, but was determined as a result of negotiations as a discretionary lump sum amount paid in cash to
the management at closing.

The Group believes that this additional payment could be regarded as a short-term employee benefit under
IAS 19, however, it is the Group’s accounting policy, where external shareholders have the obligation of
settling the payment for such benefits, without recourse from the Group, and absent an IFRS requirement,
not to attribute related expense to the consolidated financial statements.

**38. Contingent liabilities**

Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed unless the possibility of
an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote.

As at 31 December 2020, the Group is involved in a number of legal cases in the total amount claimed of
EUR 541,558 thousand (31 December 2019: EUR 182,242 thousand).

**38. Contingent liabilities (continued)**

The Group management recognized provisions for legal cases in the amount of EUR 27,420 thousand
representing its assessment of the most likely outcome of the cases (note 32) and believes that any disclosure
of the amounts provided on a case-by-case basis could seriously harm the Group’s position, but provides
details of the provisions recorded by categories of litigation as reflected below. Ultimate outcome of the cases
is inherently uncertain and may differ from the best estimate of the Group management as discussed below.

For disputes for the outcome of which no provisions were created by the Group, the Group management,
supported by legal teams, assesses the favourable outcome to be probable (more likely than not). Below are
presented litigations which could have significant impact on the Group.

**38.1.** **Viva Telecom Bulgaria EOOD’s previous Shareholder Litigation**

Certain previous direct and indirect shareholders of the seller of VIVACOM Group have initiated legal
proceedings in the United Kingdom and Luxembourg which relate to the ownership of shares in VIVACOM
Group. Certain other legal proceedings in relation to VIVACOM Group and its previous share ownership and
obligations in Bulgaria have been resolved.

The Group acquired VIVACOM’s shares in an arm’s length transaction for fair market value pursuant to a
public auction process organized by a reputable financial advisor. It is unlikely to have an adverse impact on
the Group or the VIVACOM Group.

**38.2.** **Legal cases in Serbia**

**Dispute with BS Group d.o.o., Brus in Regard to Producer’s Rights**

In 2016, BS GROUP DOO BRUS (“BS”) initiated legal proceedings against the Serbia Broadband—Srpske
kablovske mreže d.o.o. (SBB) before the Commercial Court in Serbia, claiming damages in the amount of
approximately EUR 25 million. BS claims that SBB violated BS’s producer rights in respect of certain of its
television series and films by broadcasting them outside of Serbia. SBB has responded to the claims.
Subsequently, a court expert report dated as of December 6, 2019, concluded that broadcasts had occurred
outside of Serbia. SBB submitted comments made by its own expert challenging the court expert’s report. The
Group assessed that it is not probable that this proceeding will result in a negative outcome that would
adversely impact on its financial position, therefore no provision has been recognised.

**Legal cases in Serbia—Beogradske Elektrane**

In September 2019, JKP Beogradske elektrane raised legal case against SBB. Subject of the dispute is
indemnity for using their infrastructure. Total value of dispute amounts to EUR 10,000 thousand. Plaintiff
also seek to impose an obligation on SBB Serbia to remove the network or to pay the Beogradske elektrane a
fee in the amount of EUR 100 million, which represents an amount designated by the Beogradske eletrane
and, as such, should not be directly enforceable against SBB as the payment thereof represents only an
alternative option for SBB Serbia to be allowed to maintain the network in case the court rules that the
network should be removed. The Group assessed that it is not probable that this proceeding will result in a
negative outcome that would adversely impact on its financial position, therefore no provision has been
recognised.

**Unfair competition claims by Telekom Srbija**

In December 2020 and early 2021, Telekom Srbija started proceedings before the Belgrade Commercial Court
and Zurich Commercial Court against several entities belonging to the Group in relation to the alleged acts of
unfair competition against the plaintiff. In both proceedings Telekom Srbija argues that it suffered prejudice
as a result of defamatory statements allegedly made by the defendants in relation to Telekom Srbija’s business
operations.

In its proceedings before the Belgrade Commercial Court Telekom Srbija is suing SBB d.o.o., United Media
Digital d.o.o., Adria News S.à.r.l. and United Group B.V. and is claiming damages of approximately
EUR 80 million. In its proceedings before the Zurich Commercial Court the plaintiff is suing United Media
Network AG; United Group B.V., United Media S.à.r.l., and Adria News S.à.r.l. and is claiming damages of
approximately CHF 1.35 million.

The Group considers that both courts do not have jurisdiction to review these claims and that, in any event,
these claims are without merits and are not supported by any evidence. The proceedings before both courts
are ongoing.

**Investigation of Tax Authority in Serbia**

In investigation of Tax Authority in Serbia, which resulted in decision issued in March 2019 claiming that
recharacterized interest payments made by SBB Serbia under an intragroup loan agreement (and certain
other transactions) as dividends, which would have been subject to a 5% withholding tax. Ministry of Finance
accepted appeal and annulled the Tax Administration’s decision requiring SBB to pay approximately
EUR 21 million in additional taxes for the years 2012-2016. iThe decision now instructs the Tax
Administration to repeat the procedure taking into account SBBs arguments. No provision for this uncertain
tax position has been recognised as management has assessed that it is probable that it will sustain the tax
treatment applied by the Group.

**38.3.** **Legal cases in Slovenia**

**Administrative matters**

The award of 5 MHz on 2100 MHz spectrum frequency within its 3G licenses in 2008 to Tušmobil (now
Telemach Slovenia) is currently subject of judicial review before the Administrative Court against the decision
issued by the Slovenian Agency for Communication Networks and Services (“Agency”). In court, Telemach
Slovenia is challenging Agency’s decision of May 2019, by which the Agency in the renewed frequencies
allotment procedure has rejected Tušmobil’s request for allocation of said radiofrequencies and reversed its
allotment decision of 2008, coming into the effect as of 31 December 2019. Based on Telemach Slovenia’s
proposal, in June 2019, the Administrative Court issued an interim injunction and therewith stayed the
Agency’s decision of May 2019 until the court reaches a final decision on Telemach’s lawsuit against Agency’s
decision of May 2019. The procedure before the Administrative Court concerning the Telemach Slovenia’s
lawsuit is pending. Loss of the described frequency licence would lead to capacity reduction, which might
cause decrease in quality of service in certain areas. However, additional frequencies granted in 2016 (and
currently used by Telemach Slovenia) would support the Group to mitigate the impact of any potential loss of
3G frequencies due to a renewal of the licence allocation procedure or other revocation or impairment of the
3G license that was granted in 2008. In a spectrum auction that took place in April 2021, Telemach Slovenia
successfully bid for frequency bands.

**Disputes with SAZAS Relating to Infringement of Copyrights**

From 2012 onwards, the Slovenian Association of Composers and Authors (“SAZAS”) commenced many
legal proceedings against all cable operators in Slovenia (including Telemach Slovenia) claiming infringement
of copyrights and damages for the cable retransmission of musical works. SAZAS initiated numerous legal
proceedings against Telemach Slovenia claiming copyright remuneration for cable retransmission of music
works.

**38. Contingent liabilities (continued)**

The proceedings are in different stages, as the proceedings that began in 2012 are currently considered by the
Constitutional Court, while the proceedings that were initiated in 2020 are pending before either the first
instance court or the Higher Court. In all these cases, the Group filed legal means against the courts’decisions.
The procedures are pending.

On 4 March 2021, the Copyright Board issued its decision setting a tariff for the use of music works at
EUR 0.24 per subscriber per month for retransmission of up to 100 television and 60 radio channels, and
EUR 0.27 per subscriber per month for retransmission of more than 100 television and 60 radio channels.
The Group challenged the Copyright Board decision in court.

**Sport Klub Divestiture Ruling and Investigation of Alleged Abuse of Dominant Position**

In September 2018, the Slovenian Competition Protection Agency ruled that the Group’s acquisition of
United Media Distribution (then IKO Balkan) in 2012 is incompatible with competition rules. The Slovenian
Competition Protection Agency (hereinafter—the Agency) ordered the Group to divest the activity of
broadcasting Sport Klub (SK) TV channels within nine months and imposed a ban prohibiting the Group
from broadcasting sports TV channels in Slovenia for three years from the date of divestment (with the
exception of the existing Fight Channel).

In October 2018, the Slovenian Supreme Court issued our proposed interim injunction and stayed the
implementation of the Agency’s divestment decision until a final decision on the merits of this case has been
issued. The lawsuit against the divestment decision is pending. In addition, in a separate misdemeanour
proceeding a fine of up to a legal maximum of 10% of annual revenue of the Group could be imposed for each
of the next two breaches: (i) filing of concentration notification to the Agency with delay and (ii) breaching of
the stand still obligation.

In May 2019, the Agency issued decision on misdemeanour procedure by which financial fine in the amount
of EUR 3.7 million was imposed. The Group appealed against the decision and seek to annul or change
decision in order to abolish the financial fine or at least lower it. In January 2021, the Administrative court
ruled the fine in the amount of EUR 1.56 million. The Group appealed this ruling and requested a further
reduction in the amount of the fine.

In February 2015, the Slovenian Competition Protection Agency initiated a proceeding regarding the abuse
of dominant market position by United Media Limited, IKO Balkan (now United Media Distribution) and
its Slovenian subsidiary IKO Media PRO d.o.o. (former subsidiary of the IKO Balkan—liquidated in 2016) in
the wholesale market for the supply of pay TV sports channels in Slovenia for a period beginning around
August 2012. This proceeding is currently still in its initial stages as no statement of objections has been issued
by the Slovenian Competition Protection Agency. If the Agency in this procedure ruled that the dominant
position existed and was abused a fine of up to the legal maximum of 10% of annual revenue of the previously
described companies involved in the procedure could be imposed. The Group management, supported by its
legal advisors, at this point assessed that it is likely that fine could be imposed and that level of fine would not
have material adverse impact on its financial position.

**38.4.** **Legal cases in Bosnia**

**Minority shareholders of Kablovska Televizija HS d.o.o., HKB-net d.o.o.**

As a result of acquisition of subsidiaries in Bosnia, the Group assumed significant number of ongoing court
disputes. The disputes are initiated by the minority owners of companies Kablovska Televizija HS d.o.o. and
HKB-net d.o.o. which claimed compensation for damages and cancellation of a share purchase transaction.
The cases have been filed against majority owners of Kablovska Televizija HS d.o.o. and HKB-net d.o.o. for
breaching minority shareholders’ rights. The provisional quantum of indemnity sought by the minority
shareholders is up to EUR 12,200 thousand (including penalty interest rates and costs of the proceedings),
which is determined, according to the Group legal advisors, solely by plaintiffs. Based on the advice from legal
advisors, the Group management has set aside funds in escrow account for the purpose of settlement of cases.

**Legal cases in Bosnia—Other cases**

In October 2017 claim is raised against Telemach d.o.o. by Swiss non-profit organization AGICOA for unpaid
royalties. Telemach and Agicoa were not in the contractual relation for the period covered by the law. Agicoa
claims that Telemach is liable for royalties that had been due by the companies Telemach acquired on the
Bosnian market.

In October 2019 claim is raised against Telemach d.o.o., KT HS d.o.o., HKB Net d.o.o. and M&H Company
by UFR for unpaid royalties. Telemach and UFR (Association of filmmakers in Bosnia and Herzegovina)

**40.1.** **Bonds issues**

On 26 January 2021, the Group issued additional notes in the aggregate amount of EUR 150,000 thousand
which matures on 15 November 2027, bears interest rate of 4%. These additional notes have the same
conditions as notes issued in November 2020. Interest is payable semi-annually on each 15 May and
15 November. Proceeds were used to repay a portion of the amounts drawn under the Revolving Credit
Facility that were used to fund the purchase price for the Nova Broadcasting Group Acquisition and to pay
transaction costs associated with the bond offering.

**40.2.** **Acquisition of Nova Broadcasting Group**

On 24 December 2020, the Group signed agreement to acquire 100% of stake in Bulgaria’s largest multiplatform media company Nova Broadcasting Group from Advance Media Group for consideration of

and the country’s largest online platform NetInfo, which reach on average 80% of the Bulgarian population
every month. It also operates four radio stations. The strong fit between Nova Broadcasting Group and the
Group’s other media operations gives the Group the opportunity to capture synergies and create scale that
will enable Group to further invest in local content that will delight customers.

The transaction was subject to customary regulatory approvals by the local competition authorities and was
closed on 22 January 2021.

valuation. As the result of the recognition of those intangible assets, the provisional amount of goodwill will
be significantly reduced. Goodwill on acquisition date will be allocated to the Media segment which represents
the lowest level at which it will be managed and monitored.

Significant part of goodwill will be allocated to brand name and property. Provisional goodwill on acquisition
date amount to EUR 1,226 thousand.

The acquisition related costs amount to EUR 97 thousand recognized in profit or loss in the line item Other
operating expense.

On 27 January 2021 Hellenic Capital Market Commission (HCMC) approved Mandatory Tender Offer

**Accounting policies**

A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the company. Control is achieved where the Company has existing
rights that give it the current ability to direct the activities that affect the Company’s returns and exposure or
rights to variable returns from the entity. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year
are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective
date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of
subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by the Group. All intra-group
transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.

Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the
Group’s equity therein. Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the
original business combination and the non-controlling shareholder’s share of changes in equity since the date
of the combination. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results
in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.

The Group applies the economic entity model to account for transactions with owners of non-controlling
interest in transactions that do not result in a loss of control. Any difference between the purchase
consideration and the carrying amount of non-controlling interest acquired is recorded as a capital transaction
directly in equity. The Group recognises the difference between sales consideration and the carrying amount
of non-controlling interest sold as a capital transaction in the statement of changes in equity.

**Independent Auditor’s Report**

To the Shareholders of Adria Midco BV

**Our opinion**
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Adria Midco BV (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (together—the “Group”) as at
31 December 2019, and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year
then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European
Union.

**What we have audited**
The Group’s consolidated financial statements comprise:

- the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the year ended
31 December 2019;

- the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2019;

- the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then ended;

- the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended; and

- the notes to the consolidated financial statements, which include significant accounting policies and other
explanatory information.

**Basis for opinion**
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities
under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated
financial statements section of our report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinion.

**Independence**
We are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for
Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code). We have fulfilled our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code.

**Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the consolidated financial statements**
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union, and for
such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going
concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations,
or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

**Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit
conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated
financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional
scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion,
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the Group’s internal control.

- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
and related disclosures made by management.

- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and,
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions
that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a
material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our
opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report.
However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including
the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions
and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business
activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are
responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible
for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control
that we identify during our audit.

**2. Basis of preparation**

**a)** **Statement of compliance**

The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), as adopted by the European Union (EU). The Group applied the
same accounting policies in the preparation of the financial data for the year ended 31 December 2019, except
for the EU-endorsed standards and interpretations which are effective for the reporting periods beginning on
or after 1 January 2019. These consolidated financial statements are not statutory consolidated financial
statements and they are prepared for the purpose of providing information to owners of the Group.

This is the first set of the Group’s consolidated financial statements where IFRS 16 has been applied. Changes
to significant accounting policies are described in note 4.

The consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue by the Board of Directors on 22 April 2020.

**b)** **Basis of measurement**

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for
derivative financial instruments and certain financial instruments.

**c)** **Going concern**

The Group has reported a net loss for the year ended 31 December 2019 in the amount of
EUR 60,036 thousand (2018: EUR 45,999 thousand) which was influenced by several factors including, but
not limited to: a share-based payment arrangement started in 2018 resulting in additional staff cost in the
amount of EUR 21,659 thousand for 2019 and redemption fee option for early repayment of bond in the
amount of EUR 12,578 thousand.

The Group generated net loss for the year ended 31 December 2018 in the amount of EUR 45,999 thousand
which was influenced by the introduction of new a share-based payment arrangement in 2018 resulting in
additional staff expense in the amount of EUR 32,809 thousand, impairment of goodwill in the amount of
EUR 9,255 thousand and a legal and advisory fees for M&A in the amount of EUR 17,681 thousand.

**In thousands of EUR (unless otherwise stated)**

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**2. Basis of preparation (continued)**

The expansion of the Group is based on a leveraged buyout strategy resulting in an increased finance debt
and the associated net finance expenses. The Group’s key performance indicators are adjusted earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) (note 17). Adjusted EBITDA for the year
ended 31 December 2019 has increased by 13% comparing to the same period for the 2018 (note 17).

The Group regularly (daily and monthly) analyses liquidity projections, internal financial reports, availability
of financial assets and ability to repay its liabilities through daily and/or monthly review of budgeted and
actual cash flows and monitoring of maturity of the Group’s receivables and liabilities.

Primary sources of the Group’s liquidity and funds for capital expenditures, acquisitions and other
investments have been operating cash flows, revolving credit facilities, ancillary lending facilities and leases.
The Group has reported net cash inflow from operating activities in the amount of EUR 162,621 thousand
for the year ended 31 December 2019. The Group was able to repay its obligations when they fell due in the
normal course of business with no defaults in repayment of debt, the associated financial interest expenses
nor any other liabilities. As at 31 December 2019, the Group has outstanding loans in the amount of
EUR 92,301 thousand and bond liabilities in the amount of EUR 1,654,900 thousand which matures from
2022 to 2025. In February 2020, the Group issued bonds in the amount of EUR 1,675,000 thousand for the
purpose of acquisition of BTC Group as well as early repayment of one bond tranche and repayment part of
the RCF. New bonds issuance is with maturity date in 2026 and 2028 (note 40).

As at 31 December 2019 the Group has an undrawn revolving credit line in the amount of EUR 153,246
thousand (note 32).

According to the Group’s business plan for 2020, the Group will continue to grow and expects increase in
Adjusted EBITDA, which will provide sufficient ground for financing debt, capital expenditures and working
capital.

**COVID-19**

The existence of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was confirmed in early 2020 and has spread rapidly from
mainland China across the globe, causing disruptions to businesses and economic activity. Many governments
across the world have imposed travel restrictions, lock downs and social distancing with a view to reducing the
spread of the virus and hopefully minimizing the number of fatalities. The Group considers this outbreak to
be a non-adjusting post balance sheet event.

The main priority has been the health and safety of employees and continuous provision of service. The
Group has adhered to instructions issued by the state authorities, including travel restrictions and enforced
working from home. Management believes that the impact on business is currently limited with no immediate
material adverse operational impact. Management intend to continue to follow the various national and/or
state authorities’ policies and, in parallel, intend to do utmost to continue operations as the situation evolves.

Management has reasonable expectations that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future. The results of management review of the Group’s market, operations and
financials in the past year and a forecast for at least twelve months after the date of signing of the financial
statements provides a sound basis for the appropriateness of using the going concern assumption in the
preparation of the Group’s financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019, though the existence of
Coronavirus (COVID-19) means there is generally a level of uncertainty in the wider macro market.

_Revenues and Adjusted EBITDA_

Based on analysis performed, negative impact to organic consolidated revenues could amount to 2-3%
comparing to previous year. The management expect to mitigate revenues shortfall by cost optimisation to
still record a slight organic EBITDA growth comparing to previous year.

The Group’s telco segments have continued to meet customers’ expectations on service level and network
operating centre has maintained normal service levels. Based on this, no significant change in customer

database is expected. Negative effect of increase in bad debt and decline in revenue from sale of handsets will
be offset with decline in churn rate as well as measures for cost savings whilst maintaining its ability to operate
effectively.

In its Media segment, the management expects decline in revenue by approximately 4-5% comparing to
previous year. Postponing of certain sports events effected by reduction of revenue and relevant costs. Decline
in media selling revenue will be offset by decline in relevant costs. All this combined by overall cost
optimization efforts should result in stable Adjusted EBITDA in Media segment compared to previous year.

_Financing and liquidity_

The Group expects to have sufficient cash reserves and cash generated for the forecast period to meet its
financing obligations. Net working capital is regularly monitored at each component level. Certain capex
investments, except those necessary for maintaining normal operations, have been postponed. Efforts have
been made to keep collection of receivables at highest possible level however, the management anticipates
increase in impairment loss on trade receivables up to 3million in comparison to previous year.

In February 2020 the Group issued bonds for the purpose of acquisition of BTC Group and refinancing part
of existing debt by which interest rates decreased and maturity was extended well beyond 2021.

In addition to currently available credit lines, after the closing of acquisition of the BTC Group, the Group
will have RCF in the total available amount of EUR 250 million (note 40).

The following further forms the basis of management’s use of going concern:

- The market is growing, and the business has grown its share of the overall market.

- The business has grown its revenues, gross profit margins, Adjusted EBITDA margins and operating cash
flows over the year, when compared to the prior period on an annualized basis.

- The business maintains a high level of business ethics and regulatory compliance and there is no indication
of any foreseeable material adverse change in the regulatory landscape.

- The Group is in compliance with the covenants related to the listed bonds and senior credit facilities as at
31 December 2019 and expects to remain compliant with these covenants over the duration of the forecast
period (being for at least twelve months after the date of signing of the financial statements). Refer to note
32 for further details of the covenants.

Based on the Group’s going concern assessment outlined above, the consolidated financial statements are,
therefore, prepared on a going concern basis, as management have a reasonable expectation that the Group
has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.

**d)** **Functional and presentation currency**

These consolidated financial statements are presented in Euros, which is the Company’s functional currency.
All financial information presented in Euros has been rounded to the nearest thousand. Items included in the
financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic
environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”).

**e)** **Use of estimates and judgments**

The consolidated financial statements require management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and
expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting estimates
are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**3. Significant accounting policies**

**a)** **Basis of consolidation**

**_Business combinations_**

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the business combination
is measured as the fair value of the aggregate consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair
value, fair value of any previously held interest and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquired
entity. For each business combination, any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity is measured either at
their proportionate share of the acquired entity’s identifiable net assets at the acquisition date or fair value.
Consideration transferred includes any contingent consideration measured at its acquisition date fair value.
The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships.
Such amounts are generally recognized in the statement of comprehensive income.

Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability
will be recognized in accordance with IAS 39 either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive
income. Contingent consideration that qualifies for classification as equity is not re-measured until it is finally
settled. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed.

Any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the identifiable net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill in
the consolidated statement of financial position. If the cost is lower than the identifiable net assets acquired,
the difference is recognized in profit or loss.

**_Subsidiaries_**

Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns
through its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated
financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. The accounting
policies of subsidiaries have been changed when necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the
Group.

**_Loss of control_**

Upon the loss of control, the Group derecognizes the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any
non-controlling interests and translation gains/losses accumulated in equity related to the subsidiary. Any
surplus or deficit arising on the loss of control is recognized in profit or loss. If the Group retains any interest
in the previous subsidiary, then such interest is measured at fair value at the date that control is lost.
Subsequently it is accounted for as an equity-accounted investee if the significant influence or joint control is
retained or otherwise as financial asset measured at fair value.

**_Transactions eliminated on consolidation_**

Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealized gain and losses arising from intra-group
transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

**_Purchases and sales of non-controlling interests._**

The Group applies the economic entity model to account for transactions with owners of non-controlling
interest in transactions that do not result in a loss of control. Any difference between the purchase
consideration and the carrying amount of non-controlling interest acquired is recorded as a capital transaction
directly in equity. The Group recognises the difference between sales consideration and the carrying amount
of non-controlling interest sold as a capital transaction in the statement of changes in equity.

**b)** **New standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards mandatory for the first time for the**
**financial year beginning on 1 January 2019**

**Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 (Continued)**

**In thousands of EUR (unless otherwise stated)**

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**3. Significant accounting policies (continued)**

The Group has applied the following standards and amendments for the first time for its annual financial
statements commencing 1 January 2019:

- IFRS 16 Leases

- Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation—Amendments to IFRS 9

- Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures—Amendments to IAS 28

- Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2015-2017 Cycle

- Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement—Amendments to IAS 19

- Interpretation 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments.

The Group had to change its accounting policies as a result of adopting IFRS 16. The group elected to adopt
the new rules retrospectively but recognised the cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard on
1 January 2019. This is disclosed in note 4. The other amendments listed above did not have any impact on the
amounts recognised in prior periods and are not expected to significantly affect the current or future periods.

**c)** **Standards issued but not yet adopted**

Certain new standards and interpretations have been issued that are mandatory for the annual periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2020 or later, and which the Group has not early adopted.

Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture—Amendments to
IFRS 10 and IAS 28 (issued on 11 September 2014 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after a
date to be determined by the IASB). These amendments address an inconsistency between the requirements
in IFRS 10 and those in IAS 28 in dealing with the sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its
associate or joint venture. The main consequence of the amendments is that a full gain or loss is recognised
when a transaction involves a business. A partial gain or loss is recognised when a transaction involves assets
that do not constitute a business, even if these assets are held by a subsidiary.

IFRS 17 “Insurance Contracts”(issued on 18 May 2017 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after
1 January 2021). IFRS 17 replaces IFRS 4, which has given companies dispensation to carry on accounting
for insurance contracts using existing practices. As a consequence, it was difficult for investors to compare
and contrast the financial performance of otherwise similar insurance companies. IFRS 17 is a single
principle-based standard to account for all types of insurance contracts, including reinsurance contracts that
an insurer holds. The standard requires recognition and measurement of groups of insurance contracts at:
(i) a risk-adjusted present value of the future cash flows (the fulfilment cash flows) that incorporates all of the
available information about the fulfilment cash flows in a way that is consistent with observable market
information; plus (if this value is a liability) or minus (if this value is an asset) (ii) an amount representing the
unearned profit in the group of contracts (the contractual service margin). Insurers will be recognising the
profit from a group of insurance contracts over the period they provide insurance coverage, and as they are
released from risk. If a group of contracts is or becomes loss-making, an entity will be recognising the loss
immediately.

Amendments to the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (issued on 29 March 2018 and effective
for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020). The revised Conceptual Framework includes a new
chapter on measurement; guidance on reporting financial performance; improved definitions and
guidance—in particular the definition of a liability; and clarifications in important areas, such as the roles of
stewardship, prudence and measurement uncertainty in financial reporting.

Definition of a business—Amendments to IFRS 3 (issued on 22 October 2018 and effective for acquisitions
from the beginning of annual reporting period that starts on or after 1 January 2020). The amendments revise
definition of a business. A business must have inputs and a substantive process that together significantly
contribute to the ability to create outputs. The new guidance provides a framework to evaluate when an input
and a substantive process are present, including for early stage companies that have not generated outputs. An

organised workforce should be present as a condition for classification as a business if are no outputs. The
definition of the term ‘outputs’ is narrowed to focus on goods and services provided to customers, generating
investment income and other income, and it excludes returns in the form of lower costs and other economic
benefits. It is also no longer necessary to assess whether market participants are capable of replacing missing
elements or integrating the acquired activities and assets. An entity can apply a ‘concentration test’. The
assets acquired would not represent a business if substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired is
concentrated in a single asset (or a group of similar assets).

Definition of materiality—Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 (issued on 31 October 2018 and effective for
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020). The amendments clarify the definition of material and
how it should be applied by including in the definition guidance that until now has featured elsewhere in
IFRS. In addition, the explanations accompanying the definition have been improved. Finally, the
amendments ensure that the definition of material is consistent across all IFRS Standards. Information is
material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence the decisions that
the primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those consolidated financial
statements, which provide financial information about a specific reporting entity.

Interest rate benchmark reform—Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 (issued on 26 September 2019
and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020). The amendments were triggered by
replacement of benchmark interest rates such as LIBOR and other inter-bank offered rates (‘IBORs’). The
amendments provide temporary relief from applying specific hedge accounting requirements to hedging
relationships directly affected by the IBOR reform.

Classification of liabilities as current or non-current—Amendments to IAS 1 (issued on 23 January 2020 and
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022).These narrow scope amendments clarify
that liabilities are classified as either current or non-current, depending on the rights that exist at the end of
the reporting period. Liabilities are non-current if the entity has a substantive right, at the end of the reporting
period, to defer settlement for at least twelve months. The guidance no longer requires such a right to be
unconditional. Management’s expectations whether they will subsequently exercise the right to defer
settlement do not affect classification of liabilities. The right to defer only exists if the entity complies with
any relevant conditions as of the end of the reporting period. A liability is classified as current if a condition
is breached at or before the reporting date even if a waiver of that condition is obtained from the lender after
the end of the reporting period. Conversely, a loan is classified as non-current if a loan covenant is breached
only after the reporting date. In addition, the amendments include clarifying the classification requirements
for debt a company might settle by converting it into equity. ‘Settlement’ is defined as the extinguishment of a
liability with cash, other resources embodying economic benefits or an entity’s own equity instruments. There
is an exception for convertible instruments that might be converted into equity, but only for those instruments
where the conversion option is classified as an equity instrument as a separate component of a compound
financial instrument.

The new standards and interpretations are not expected to affect significantly the Group’s consolidated
financial statements.

**d)** **Foreign currency**

**_Foreign currency transactions_**

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at
exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies at the reporting date are translated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated to the
functional currency at the exchange rate when the fair value was determined. Foreign currency differences are
recognized in consolidated statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income. Non-monetary
items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are not translated.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**3. Significant accounting policies (continued)**

Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation
at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized
in profit or loss and presented within finance costs.

**_Foreign operations_**

The results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency different from the
presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:

- assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the reporting date,

- income and expenses for each statement of profit or loss are translated at average exchange rates (unless
this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the
transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of transactions)
and,

- the translation adjustment resulting from the use of these different rates is included in other comprehensive
income

**e)** **Financial instruments**

**_Key measurement terms_**

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The best evidence of fair value is the price
in an active market. An active market is one in which transactions for the asset or liability take place with
sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

Valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow models or models based on recent arm’s length transactions
or consideration of financial data of the investees are used to measure fair value of certain financial
instruments for which external market pricing information is not available. Fair value measurements are
analysed by level in the fair value hierarchy as follows: (i) level one are measurements at quoted prices
(unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, (ii) level two measurements are valuations
techniques with all material inputs observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or
indirectly (that is, derived from prices), and (iii) level three measurements are valuations not based on solely
observable market data (that is, the measurement requires significant unobservable inputs). Transfers between
levels of the fair value hierarchy are deemed to have occurred at the end of the reporting period.

Transaction costs are incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, issue or disposal of a
financial instrument. An incremental cost is one that would not have been incurred if the transaction had not
taken place. Transaction costs include fees and commissions paid to agents (including employees acting as
selling agents), advisors, brokers and dealers, levies by regulatory agencies and securities exchanges, and
transfer taxes and duties. Transaction costs do not include debt premiums or discounts, financing costs or
internal administrative or holding costs.

Amortised cost (“AC”) is the amount at which the financial instrument was recognised at initial recognition
less any principal repayments, plus accrued interest, and for financial assets less any allowance for expected
credit losses (“ECL”). Accrued interest includes amortisation of transaction costs deferred at initial
recognition and of any premium or discount to the maturity amount using the effective interest method.
Accrued interest income and accrued interest expense, including both accrued coupon and amortised discount
or premium (including fees deferred at origination, if any), are not presented separately and are included in
the carrying values of the related items in the consolidated statement of financial position.

The effective interest method is a method of allocating interest income or interest expense over the relevant
period, so as to achieve a constant periodic rate of interest (effective interest rate) on the carrying amount.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts

(excluding future credit losses) through the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, if
appropriate, to the gross carrying amount of the financial instrument. The effective interest rate discounts
cash flows of variable interest instruments to the next interest repricing date, except for the premium or
discount which reflects the credit spread over the floating rate specified in the instrument, or other variables
that are not reset to market rates. Such premiums or discounts are amortised over the whole expected life of
the instrument. The present value calculation includes all fees paid or received between parties to the contract
that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. For assets that are purchased or originated credit impaired
(“POCI”) at initial recognition, the effective interest rate is adjusted for credit risk, i.e. it is calculated based on
the expected cash flows on initial recognition instead of contractual payments.

**_Financial instruments—initial recognition_**

Financial instruments at FVTPL are initially recorded at fair value. All other financial instruments are initially
recorded at fair value adjusted for transaction costs. Fair value at initial recognition is best evidenced by the
transaction price. A gain or loss on initial recognition is only recorded if there is a difference between fair
value and transaction price which can be evidenced by other observable current market transactions in the
same instrument or by a valuation technique whose inputs include only data from observable markets. After
the initial recognition, an ECL allowance is recognised for financial assets measured at AC and investments in
debt instruments measured at FVOCI, resulting in an immediate accounting loss.

All purchases and sales of financial assets that require delivery within the time frame established by regulation
or market convention (“regular way” purchases and sales) are recorded at trade date, which is the date on
which the Group commits to deliver a financial asset. All other purchases are recognised when the Group
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

**_Financial assets—classification and subsequent measurement—measurement categories_**

The Group classifies financial assets in the following measurement categories: FVTPL, FVOCI and AC. The
classification and subsequent measurement of debt financial assets depends on: (i) the Group’s business model
for managing the related assets portfolio and (ii) the cash flow characteristics of the asset.

**_Financial assets—classification and subsequent measurement—business model_**

The business model reflects how the Group manages the assets in order to generate cash flows—whether the
Group’s objective is: (i) solely to collect the contractual cash flows from the assets (“hold to collect contractual
cash flows”,) or (ii) to collect both the contractual cash flows and the cash flows arising from the sale of assets
(“hold to collect contractual cash flows and sell”) or, if neither of (i) and (ii) is applicable, the financial assets
are classified as part of “other” business model and measured at FVTPL.

Business model is determined for a group of assets (on a portfolio level) based on all relevant evidence about
the activities that the Group undertakes to achieve the objective set out for the portfolio available at the date
of the assessment.

Financial assets—classification and subsequent measurement—cash flow characteristics. Where the business
model is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows or to hold contractual cash flows and sell, the Group
assesses whether the cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest (“SPPI”). Financial assets
with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows are
consistent with the SPPI feature. In making this assessment, the Group considers whether the contractual
cash flows are consistent with a basic lending arrangement, i.e. interest includes only consideration for credit
risk, time value of money, other basic lending risks and profit margin.

Where the contractual terms introduce exposure to risk or volatility that is inconsistent with a basic lending
arrangement, the financial asset is classified and measured at FVTPL. The SPPI assessment is performed on
initial recognition of an asset and it is not subsequently reassessed.

Financial assets—reclassification. Financial instruments are reclassified only when the business model for
managing the portfolio as a whole change. The reclassification has a prospective effect and takes place from
the beginning of the first reporting period that follows after the change in the business model.

**_Financial assets impairment—credit loss allowance for ECL_**

The Group assesses, on a forward-looking basis, the ECL for debt instruments measured at AC and FVOCI
and for the exposures arising from loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts, for contract assets.
The Group measures ECL and recognises net impairment losses on financial and contract assets at each
reporting date. The measurement of ECL reflects: (i) an unbiased and probability weighted amount that is
determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes, (ii) time value of money and (iii) all reasonable and
supportable information that is available without undue cost and effort at the end of each reporting period
about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future conditions.

Debt instruments measured at AC, trade and other receivables, loans issued and contract assets are presented
in the consolidated statement of financial position net of the allowance for ECL. For loan commitments and
financial guarantees, a separate provision for ECL is recognised as a liability in the consolidated statement of
financial position. For debt instruments at FVOCI, changes in amortised cost, net of allowance for ECL, are
recognised in profit or loss and other changes in carrying value are recognised in OCI as gains less losses on
debt instruments at FVOCI.

The Group applies simplified approach for impairment of trade receivables without significant financing
component and contract assets. For other financial assets the Group applies a three-stage model for
impairment, based on changes in credit quality since initial recognition. A financial instrument that not had a
significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition or that have low credit risk at the reporting date is
classified in Stage 1. Financial assets in Stage 1 have their ECL measured at an amount equal to the portion of
lifetime ECL that results from default events possible within the next 12 months or until contractual maturity,
if shorter (“12 Months ECL”). If the Group identifies a significant increase in credit risk (“SICR”) since
initial recognition, the asset is transferred to Stage 2 and its ECL is measured based on ECL on a lifetime
basis, that is, up until contractual maturity but considering expected prepayments, if any (“Lifetime ECL”). If
the Group determines that a financial asset is credit-impaired, the asset is transferred to Stage 3 and its ECL
is measured as a Lifetime ECL. For financial assets that are purchased or originated credit-impaired (“POCI
Assets”), the ECL is always measured as a Lifetime ECL.

Range of expected rates applied to trade receivables as at 31 December 2019 and 2018 are presented in table
below:

**Up to 1** **1 to 2** **2 to 3** **3 to 6** **6 to 9** **Over**
**not due** **month** **months** **months** **months** **months** **9 months**

range . . . . . 0.2%–4.7% 0.74%–4.70% 0.2%–11.3% 2.5%–26.5% 10.33%–44.4% 24.94%–100% 100%

The non-recoverability analysis is conducted for the past 3 years to determine the general default ratio. In
order to determine the default rate for a given ageing interval, the balance of receivables written-off is
compared against the balance of outstanding receivables.

**_Financial assets—write-off_**

Financial assets are written-off, in whole or in part, when the Group exhausted all practical recovery efforts
and has concluded that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. The write-off represents a derecognition
event. The Group may write-off financial assets that are still subject to enforcement activity when the Group
seeks to recover amounts that are contractually due, however, there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.

**_Cash and cash equivalents_**

Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, and other short-term highly
liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Cash and cash equivalents are carried at

AC because: (i) they are held for collection of contractual cash flows and those cash flows represent SPPI, and
(ii) they are not designated at FVTPL. Features mandated solely by legislation, such as the bail-in legislation
in certain countries, do not have an impact on the SPPI test, unless they are included in contractual terms such
that the feature would apply even if the legislation is subsequently changed. Cash and cash equivalents
comprise cash balances and call deposits with original maturities of three months or less. Cash and cash
equivalents are measured at amortized cost less the loss allowances determined applying the expected credit
losses model descried above in section Financial assets impairment—credit loss allowance for ECL.

**_Borrowings_**

Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred, and are subsequently carried
at AC using the effective interest method.

**_Trade and other payables_**

Trade payables are accrued when the counterparty performs its obligations under the contract and are
recognised initially at fair value and subsequently carried at AC using the effective interest method

**_Capitalisation of borrowing costs_**

General and specific borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of
assets that necessarily take a substantial time to get ready for intended use or sale (qualifying assets) are
capitalised as part of the costs of those assets.

The commencement date for capitalisation is when (a) the Group incurs expenditures for the qualifying asset;
(b) it incurs borrowing costs; and (c) it undertakes activities that are necessary to prepare the asset for its
intended use or sale.

Capitalisation of borrowing costs continues up to the date when the assets are substantially ready for their use
or sale.

The Group does not have qualifying asset for capitalised borrowing costs, therefore no borrowing costs were
capitalized to the value of property, plant and equipment as at 31 December 2019.

**_Financial guarantees_**

Financial guarantees require the Group to make specified payments to reimburse the holder of the guarantee
for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the original
or modified terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantees are initially recognised at their fair value, which
is normally evidenced by the amount of fees received. This amount is amortised on a straight line basis over
the life of the guarantee. At the end of each reporting period, the guarantees are measured at the higher of:

- the amount of the loss allowance for the guaranteed exposure determined based on the expected loss model
and

- the remaining unamortised balance of the amount at initial recognition. In addition, an ECL loss allowance
is recognised for fees receivable that are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position as an
asset.

**f)** **Property, plant and equipment**

**_Recognition and measurement_**

Property, plant and equipment comprise mainly cable network (coaxial and optical primary and secondary
network and backbone) and customer premise equipment (CPE—receivers and modems). Items of property,
plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**3. Significant accounting policies (continued)**

Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of selfconstructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to
bringing the assets to a working condition for their intended use, the costs of dismantling and removing the
items and restoring the site on which they are located and capitalized borrowing costs. Purchased software
that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalized as part of that equipment.

When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as
separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.

The gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined by comparing the
proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of the property, plant and equipment, and is recognized net
within other income/other expenses in profit or loss.

**_Subsequent costs_**

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate,
only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the
cost of the item can be measured reliably. Cost of replacing major parts or components of property, plant and
equipment items are capitalised and depreciated over shorter of remaining useful life of an asset or period
until major part are replaced again. Cost of the replaced part is retired. All other repairs and maintenance are
recognized in profit or loss during the financial period in which they are incurred.

**_Depreciation_**

Depreciation is based on the depreciable amount of an asset. Significant components of individual assets are
assessed and if a component has a useful life that is different from the remainder of that asset, that component
is depreciated separately.

Depreciation is recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each
component of an item of property, plant and equipment. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the
lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will obtain ownership by the end
of the lease term. The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows:

**Number of years**

**g)** **Goodwill**

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition (as defined in the note 3(a)) over the fair value of
the identifiable net assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is measured at cost
less accumulated impairment losses.

**h)** **Intangible assets**

Intangible assets that are acquired by the Group and have finite useful lives are measured at cost less
accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses.

**_Trademarks_**

Trademarks are acquired in a business combination, recognized at fair value at the acquisition date.
Trademarks are amortized over their useful lives.

Trademarks include following trade names: “SBB”, “Total TV”, “Telemach”, “Sport Klub”, “Nova TV” and
“Direct Media”.

**_Contractual customer relationships_**

Contractual customer relationships acquired in a business combination are recognized at fair value at the
acquisition date. The contractual customer relations have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less
accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses.

**_Computer software_**

Costs associated with maintaining computer software are recognized as an expense as incurred. Software is
recognized at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment. Cost includes expenditure to
acquire software and directly attributable costs to prepare it for its intended use.

Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software
products controlled by the Group are recognized as intangible assets when the relevant criteria are satisfied:

(a) the technical feasibility of completing the software so that it will be available for use or sale.

(b) its intention to complete the software and use or sell it.

(c) its ability to use or sell the software.

(d) how the software will generate probable future economic benefits

(e) the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to
use or sell the software.

(f) its ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the software during its development.

Directly attributable costs, capitalized as part of the software product, includes software development
employee cost and appropriate portion of relevant overheads. Other development expenditures that do not
meet these criteria are recognized as an expense as incurred. Development costs previously recognized as an
expense are not recognized as an asset in a subsequent period. Computer software development costs
recognized as assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.

**_Programming rights_**

When entering into contracts for the acquisition of film, series, shows or sports events, the rights acquired are
classified as contractual commitments. The Group assesses each license agreement which span over period
longer than one year whether it meets definition of an intangible asset and recognition criteria. They are
recorded in the statement of financial position and classified as programming rights as follows:

- Programming rights for films and television series are recognized at cost when the program is available for
screening and are expensed over their broadcasting period.

- Sports rights are recognized at cost at the opening of the broadcasting period of the related sports season
start or contract date if season start is not defined in the contract itself. If the licence agreement spans over
more than one year, the Group will recognize programming rights only to the level of assets available for
broadcasting (e.g. one season).

- Own-produced programming rights are capitalized on the balance sheet at cost which are directly related to
the project being developed such as direct external development costs, allocated costs of employees and
development overhead pool directly attributable to preparing the asset for use and will be amortized based
on program viewership forecast method

**3. Significant accounting policies (continued)**

The amortization charge for each period should be recognized in profit or loss statement as amortization of
programming rights.

Advance payments for acquired programming assets, prior to licence begin date, are recognized as
prepayments for programming assets.

Signed and binding contracts for purchase of programming, which do not meet recognition criteria for
programming assets are not recognized in the balance sheet and are instead disclosed as contractual
commitments in the amount of the outstanding contract liability at the reporting date.

**_Subscriber acquisition cost_**

Subscriber acquisition include costs associated with entering into sales contracts with new customers, for
example commissions paid to internal or external sales personnel. Intangible assets are recognized only for
costs that are incremental to obtaining the contract. Amortization is calculated using the straight-line method
over the expected life of the customer relationship.

**_Radio frequency rights_**

Property rights relates to rights to radio frequencies in Slovenia. The company uses the cost model and thus
manages intangible assets at their purchase values less depreciation adjustments following the straight-line
amortization method. Any intangible assets that meet the conditions for recognition are valued at cost upon
initial recognition. Property rights are amortized in a period of 10 years.

**_Subsequent expenditure_**

Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when satisfy the conditions for recognition as an asset. All other
expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands, is recognized in profit or loss
as incurred.

**_Amortization_**

Amortization is based on the depreciable amount of an asset and is calculated using straight-line method
(except for own-produced programming rights, see above) to allocate their cost over their estimated useful
lives, except for television programming rights which are amortised based on program viewership forecast
method. Useful life of these assets is presented in table below

further runs.

Amortization methods and useful lives are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate.

**i)** **Inventories**

Inventories comprise of materials for construction, mobile handsets, CPEs (Customer Premise Equipment—
mainly modems and receivers) for sale and television programming rights.

Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The cost of inventories includes the cost
of purchase, transport and expenses incurred in bringing the inventory to its present condition and location.
The cost is based on the weighted-average method. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the
ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.

Television programming rights represents content for short-term use, including acquired and own-produced
programming rights used in the normal course of business.

The Group writes down for slow-moving or obsolete inventories based on inventory turnover ratios and
management’s best judgments regarding future usage plans of inventories.

**j)** **Impairment of non-financial assets**

The Group expensed short term programming rights based on schedule and number of airings: one airing—
100%; two airings 70% and 30%; three airings—50%, 28% and 22% Non-financial assets, except for deferred
tax assets, income tax receivable and inventories are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for
the amount by which the asset’s or CGU’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable
amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. This impairment test is performed
to compare the recoverable amount of each Cash Generating Unit (CGU) or, if necessary in cases of goodwill,
CGU to the carrying value of the CGU (including goodwill, if goodwill has been allocated to CGU or group
of CGUs). A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely
independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.

The value in use of each asset or group of assets is determined as the discounted value of future cash flows
(Discounted Cash Flow method (DCF)) by using cash flow projections consistent with the budget of the
following year, the most recent forecasts prepared by the operating segments and long-term projections.

Applied discount rates are determined by reference to available external sources of information, usually based
on financial institutions’ benchmarks, and reflect the current assessment by the Group of the time value of
money and risks specific to each asset or group of assets. Perpetual growth rates used for the evaluation of
CGUs are those used to prepare budgets for each CGU or group of CGUs, and beyond the period covered,
are consistent with growth rates estimated by the business by extrapolating growth rates used in the budgets,
without exceeding the long-term average growth rate for the markets in which the group operates. The fair
value (less costs to sell) is the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or group of assets in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, less costs to sell. These values are
generally determined on the basis of market data (stock market prices or comparison with similar listed
companies, with the value attributed to similar assets or companies in recent transactions) or, in the absence
of such data, on the basis of discontinued cash flows. If the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying
value of an asset or group of assets, an impairment loss equal to the difference is recognized in statement of
profit and loss. In the case of a group of assets, this impairment loss is first recorded against goodwill. The
impairment losses recognized in respect of property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets (other than
goodwill) may be reversed in a later period if the recoverable amount becomes greater than the carrying value,
within the limit of impairment losses previously recognized. Impairment losses recognized in respect of
goodwill cannot be reversed at a later date. Impairment losses are recognized in the statement of profit or loss.
Non-financial assets, excluding goodwill, that suffered impairment, are reviewed for possible reversal of the
impairment at each reporting date.

CGUs are independently defined at each business level, corresponding to the group operating segments. An
impairment test of goodwill is performed by the Group for each CGU or group of CGUs, depending on the
level at which management measures return on operations.

**k)** **Employee benefits**

In accordance with the regulations prevailing in the countries where the Group operates, the Group has an
obligation to pay contributions to various state social security funds. These obligations involve the payment
of contributions on behalf of the employee, by the employer in an amount calculated by applying the specific,
legally prescribed rates. Entities within the Group are also legally obligated to withhold contributions from
gross salaries to employees, and on their behalf to transfer the withheld portions directly to the appropriate
government funds. These contributions payable on behalf of the employee and employer are charged to
expenses in the period in which they arise.

The Group does not operate any private pension scheme or post retirement defined contribution plan.

In certain countries of operations, the Group is obliged to pay to employees defined by the law one-of
retirement payment. The calculation of retirement payments provided by the Law is performed annually by a
qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.

Termination benefits for voluntary redundancies are recognized as an expense if the Group has made an offer
of voluntary redundancy, if it is probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number of acceptances can
be estimated reliably. If benefits are payable more than 12 months after the reporting date, then they are
discounted to their present value.

Accumulating compensated absences may be carried forward and used in future periods if the current period’s
entitlement has not been fully used. The expected cost of accumulated compensated absences is recognized in
the amount that is expected to be paid as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated as of the
consolidated statement of financial position date.

In the instance of non-accumulating compensated absences, no liability or expense is recognized until the
time of the absence.

**l)** **Provisions**

Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past
events; it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the
amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognized for future operating losses.

Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation
using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific
to the obligation. The increase in the provisions due to passage of time is recognized as interest expense.

**m)** **Revenue**

The Group’s process for revenue recognition from multi-element contracts (e.g. mobile service and handset)
consists of:

- assessment of all goods and services provided to the subscriber under the contract and identifying separate
performance obligations in that contract,

- determining and allocating the transaction prices to separate performance obligations in the contract; the
allocation is based on the reference to their relative standalone selling prices that could be obtained if the
promised goods and services were sold individually in a separate transaction.

In determining the transaction price, the Group shall adjust the promised amount of consideration for the
effects of the time value of money if the timing of payments agreed to by the parties to the contract (either
explicitly or implicitly) provides the customer or the entity with a significant benefit of financing the transfer
of goods or services to the customer. In those circumstances, the contract contains a significant financing
component. However, based on the management analysis and considered factors noted in IFRS 15.61, at
present, the financing component is considered to be immaterial of handset and would not materially change

the amount of revenue that should be recognized in relation to a contract with a customer and thus, there is
no need to determine the present value of future cash flows from handset to calculate the initial value of the
contract asset. The Group will continue to monitor contract offerings and mobile business models

**_Subscription fee revenues_**

Revenue from subscription services consists primarily of monthly fees paid by subscribers for provision of
telecommunication service. These revenues are recognized within the profit or loss in proportion to the length
service provided (subscription fee) over time in the period when related services are rendered.

The Group generates following main subscription-based service revenue streams which are recognized in the
period when the service is provided: Cable TV (CATV), Digital TV (D3), cable and fibre Internet service,
satellite TV (Direct to Home—DTH) and mobile telephony service.

_Mobile telephone service revenues_

Revenues from the rendered services relate to mobile services containing amounts charged to post-paid plan
customers for monthly service fees, which includes: voice, data and SMS.

Based on IFRS 15, revenue should follow performance and not timing of payment, as the Group has
obligation to provide service to the customer. The revenue is recognized over time and only to the extent of
provided service, and remaining of the consideration received is deferred. Mobile phone service is a “stand
ready”obligation”and the obligation is satisfied by passage of time so the fixed monthly fee is spread straight
line over the time of the contract. The fee charged additionally for telephone conversation and SMS is a
variable consideration which is recognized as revenue when the even usage giving rise to such fee occurs.

Handsets subsidized represents a distinct performance obligation and realization of revenues to each
performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis is required. The subsidy of the hardware
leads to the recognition of a contract asset under IFRS 15. The total consideration allocated to this
performance obligation based on the relative stand- alone selling prices of performance obligations within
this contract and amount accrued at this point is recognised as contract asset. The IFRS 15 adjustment results
in revenue recognition from the sale of hardware at the contract inception and the recognition of contract
asset in the balance sheet. During the minimum contract duration (two years) contract asset is settled from
the monthly service fee paid by the customer.

The Group uses the practical expedient under IFRS15 and recognizes fee from voice, data and SMS in the
amount to which the Group has a right to invoice.

**_Carriage fees_**

Carriage fee revenue relates to sales of pay-tv channel to other cable operators. The Group is the owner of
pay-tv channels including brands like “Sport Klub”, movie channel “Cinemania”, children channel “Pikaboo”
and music channel “Grand”.

Revenue is recognized over the time, depending on a contract, either on straight-line basis over the sales
contract period when the fixed fee is contracted or number of subscribers multiplied by agreed price per user.

**_Advertising revenue_**

Advertising revenue is derived primarily from broadcasting of advertising content and is recognized over the
time when the advertising is broadcast. Revenue is recognized in profit or loss in the amount due from
customers net of value added tax and any rebates granted, which is highly probable that it will not be reversed.

**_Media selling_**

Media selling revenue relates to selling of advertising space in any communication platform, such as
newspapers, magazines, outdoor billboards and screens, event sponsorship, commercial radio or television,

business information/data and online/digital. The Group acts as principal in media selling (note 6). Media
selling revenue is recognized over the time of providing the service.

**_Revenue from sale of handset_**

Revenue from sale of handset is recognized at point in time when the control is transferred to the buyer which
usually is the moment when the customer obtains the handset.

**_Other revenue_**

Other revenue mainly arises from lease of cable network and represents lease component accounted for under
IFRS 16.

**_Contract assets and contract liabilities arising from the contracts with the customers_**

The contract assets arise mainly from:

- the sales of the subsidised handsets—the revenue is recognised when the customer obtains the handset
whereas the payment is obtained over the period for which the customer has committed the mobile services
which usually is two years.

- uneven payments relating to discounts provided to customers.

The contract liability is recognised in relation to advertising, media selling, carriage fee and subscription due
to payments received at the inception of the contract whereas the revenue is recognised over time which
usually is 12 months.

**n)** **Costs**

Content and link and interconnection costs are recorded as the services are provided.

**_Content costs_**

Content cost relates to (i) royalty fees paid to broadcasting organizations for their TV content, (ii) fees to
broadcasting companies or (iii) own production of content for short term use. The Group has separate
contracts with broadcasting organizations which define conditions under which programs will be broadcast.

**_Link and interconnection costs_**

Link and interconnection costs are recorded based on the Group’s contractual agreements with its vendors
for internet link capacity and mobile network usage. Costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the
contract period.

**o)** **Finance income and finance costs**

Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested (including short-term bank deposits), and foreign
currency gains. Interest income is recognized as it accrues in profit or loss.

Finance costs comprise interest expense on borrowings and foreign currency losses. Borrowing costs that are
not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are recognized in
profit or loss using the effective interest method.

Interest paid on borrowings, bonds and lease is classified as operating cash outflow in the consolidated
statement of cash flow.

**p)** **Income tax**

Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. It is recognized in profit or loss except to the extent
that it relates to items recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.

**3. Significant accounting policies (continued)**

Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates
enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of
previous years. Current tax payable also includes any tax liability arising from the declaration of dividends.

Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not
recognized for:

- temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that is not a business
combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss,

- temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements to the extent
that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable
that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and

- taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax assets are recognized for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary
differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can
be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no
longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they
reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities
and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on
different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets
and liabilities will be realized simultaneously.

**q)** **Segment reporting**

An operating segment is a component of the Group:

- that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses that relate to
transactions with any of the Group’s other components,

- whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Makers and

- for which discrete financial information is available.

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief
operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker is responsible for allocating resources and
assessing performance of the operating segments.

**r)** **Tax exposures**

The Group applies IFRIC 23 in assessment of uncertain tax position. The Group determines whether to
consider each uncertain tax treatment separately or together with one or more other uncertain tax treatments
based on which approach better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty. In determining the approach that
better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty, an entity might consider, for example, (a) how it prepares its
income tax filings and supports tax treatments; or (b) how the entity expects the taxation authority to make its
examination and resolve issues that might arise from that examination.

In assessing whether and how an uncertain tax treatment affects the determination of taxable profit (tax loss),
tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates, the Group assumes that a taxation authority will
examine amounts it has a right to examine and have full knowledge of all related information when making
those examinations. When the Group concludes it is probable that the taxation authority will accept an
uncertain tax treatment, the entity shall determine the taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses,
unused tax credits or tax rates consistently with the tax treatment used or planned to be used in its income tax
filings.

When the Group concludes it is not probable that the taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax
treatment, the Group reflects the effect of uncertainty in determining the related taxable profit (tax loss), tax
bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits or tax rates. The Group reflects the effect of uncertainty for each
uncertain tax treatment by using either of the following methods, depending on which method the entity
expects to better predict the resolution of the uncertainty:

a) the most likely amount—the single most likely amount in a range of possible outcomes. The most likely
amount may better predict the resolution of the uncertainty if the possible outcomes are binary or are
concentrated on one value.

b) the expected value—the sum of the probability-weighted amounts in a range of possible outcomes. The
expected value may better predict the resolution of the uncertainty if there is a range of possible outcomes
that are neither binary nor concentrated on one value.

When uncertain tax treatment affects current tax and deferred tax (for example, if it affects both taxable
profit used to determine current tax and tax bases used to determine deferred tax), the Group makes consistent
judgements and estimates for both current tax and deferred tax.

**4. Change of accounting policy**

This note explains the impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 Leases on the Group’s consolidated financial
statements and also discloses the new accounting policies that have been applied from 1 January 2019, where
they are different to those applied in prior periods.

IFRS 16 introduces a single, on-balance sheet lease accounting model for lessees. A lessee recognises a rightof-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to
make lease payments.

There are recognition exemptions for short-term leases and leases of low-value items available on the voluntary
basis. The Group has elected to apply those exemption therefore the payments associated with all short-term
leases and leases of a low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss.
Short term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT-equipment,
computers, mobile phones etc.

The Group elected the following practical expedients:

- no adjustment on transition for leases for which the underlying asset is of low-value;

- no adjustment on transition for leases of short term;

**Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 (Continued)**

**In thousands of EUR (unless otherwise stated)**

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**4. Change of accounting policy (continued)**

- exempt leases for which the lease term end within 12 months after the date of initial application and account
those as short-term leases;

- a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics;

- adjust the right-of-use asset for any recognized onerous lease provisions, instead of performing an
impairment review;

- exclude initial direct costs from the measurement of the right-of-use asset;

- use hindsight, such as in determining the lease term if the contract contains options to extend or terminate;

- does not separate non-lease components for all classes of assets.

Lessor accounting remains similar to the current standard—i.e. lessors continue to classify leases as finance
or operating leases.

_Accounting policy applied until 31 December 2018_

Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Group
as lessee are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to profit and
loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.

Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the Group as
lessee are classified as finance leases. At the commencement of the lease term, finance leases are recognised as
assets and liabilities in statement of financial position at amounts equal to the fair value of the leased asset or,
if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.

_Accounting policy applied from 1 January 2019_

Leases are recorded as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is
available for use by the Group.

Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis.

Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments for the right of use the underlying
asset during the lease term:

- Fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentive receivable;

- Variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate;

- Amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;

- The exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonable certain to exercise that option;

- Payment of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option.

The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be determined,
otherwise the Group’s incremental borrowing rate is applied.

For the incremental borrowing rate, the Group considered the rate of interest that it would have to pay to
borrow, over a similar term and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar
value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment. When calculating the incremental borrowing
rate, the Group considered the rate at which the entity borrows funds (bond rate) and does not reflect the cost
of equity finance.

As at 1 January 2019, the Adria Midco BV (the Group) had three tranches of euro denominated corporate
bonds outstanding. Two of secured bond notes (secured with UG subsidiaries’property, equipment, intangible
assets and receivables) had a fixed interest of 4.375% and 4.875% respectively and mature in 2022 and 2024,

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**4. Change of accounting policy (continued)**

respectively. Length of the Group leases range from 2 to 29.6 years. The third tranche, which has a floating
rate, does not significantly differ in terms. In general, these bonds best reflect the rate at which the Group
could borrow funds and also reflects secured borrowing (rather than an unsecured borrowing or a general line
of credit).

Two of secured bond notes have been used as a starting point, base rate. No additional adjustment was
required, due to the fact that the lessor effectively has security of owning the asset and no highly illiquid asset
have been leased. For determining appropriate lease terms, linear interpolation / extrapolation has been used
as one of the simpler methods to estimate rates beyond the original observation range.

Weighted average incremental borrowing rates used at the date of 1 January 2019 and first application of
IFRS 16 was 5.5% for EUR as majority of lease contracts.

The lease term is a non-cancellable period of a lease; extension options or periods after termination options
are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended or not terminated.

In determining the lease term, management considers all fact and circumstances that create an economic
incentive to exercise an extension option, or not to exercise a termination option. The assessment is reviewed
if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs which affects this assessment and that is
within the control of the Group.

Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or
loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the
liability for each period.

Right-of-use assets are measured initially at cost comprising the following:

- The amount of the initial measurement of lease liability,

- Any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentive received,

- Any initial direct costs,

- Restoration costs.

Subsequently, the right-of-use asset measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated
impairment losses, and adjusted for reassessment of the lease liability due to reassessment or lease
modifications. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term
on a straight-line basis.

Depreciation rates for right-of-use asset as per asset classes are as follows:

- Properties: 4% to 93%;

- Base stations: 3% to 93%;

- Machinery and equipment: 17%;

- Optical fibres: 7% to 52%

- Satellite transponder: 17%

- Motor vehicles: 20% to 80%

- Water surface 13%.

_Definition of lease_

Previously, the Group determined at contract inception whether an arrangement was or contained a lease
under the IFRIC 4 and IAS 17. The Group now assesses whether the contract is or contains lease based on the

**Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 (Continued)**

**In thousands of EUR (unless otherwise stated)**

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**4. Change of accounting policy (continued)**

new definition of lease. Under IFRS 16, a contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys a right to
control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange of consideration.

The Group applies the practical expedient to grandfather the definition of a lease on transition. This means
that it will apply IFRS 16 to all contracts entered into before 1 January 2019 and identified as leases in
accordance with IAS 17 and IFRIC 4.

_As a lessee_

The Group leases many assets including properties, satellite capacity, facilities and infrastructure which were
previously recognized under operating lease.

Leases are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions
(including termination and renewal rights). The main lease features are summarised below:

- Properties are leased for the fixed period of 1 to 23 years, starting from the date of first implementation of
IFRS 16. The contracts contain an option to renew the lease. The majority of lease payments are fixed,
some with variable part based on index or rate.

- Base stations are leased for the fixed period of 1 to 30 years, starting from the date of first implementation.
The lease payments are fixed or fixed with variable part based on index or rate.

- Machinery and equipment are leased for one to eight years, starting from the date of first implementation.
The leased payments are fixed.

- Optical fibres are rented for the fixed period of 1 to 15 years. The lease payments are fixed.

- The satellite transponder lease is for six years, starting from the date of first implementation. The leased
payments are fixed.

- Motor vehicles are leased for the fixed period of 1 to 4 years, starting from the date of first implementation.
The leased payments are fixed.

- The right of use of a water surface for laying optical network and cable-distribution system for period of
10 years. The lease payments are fixed.

- Use of under land surface owned by local municipality for placing the cables for period of 12 months, with
extension option. The lease payment is variable, not based on rate or index.

Previously, the Group recognised operating lease expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease,
and recognised assets and liabilities only to the extent that there was a timing difference between actual lease
payments and the expense recognised.

Under IFRS 16, the Group recognises new assets and liabilities for its operating leases of satellite, office
facilities, part of infrastructure, as well base stations and the right of use of a water and land surface. The
nature of expenses related to those leases has been changed because the Group will recognise a depreciation
charge for right-of-use assets and interest expense on lease liabilities.

_As a lessor_

Where the Group is a lessor in a lease which transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to
ownership to the lessee, the assets leased out does not present identifiable assets, though it is used by the
Group as well, e.g. cable network.

_Transition and impacts on transition_

The Group applies the simplified transition approach and does not restate comparative amounts for the year
prior to first adoption. Right-of-use assets for property leases is measured on transition as if the new rules
had always been applied. All other right-of-use assets are measured at the amount of the lease liability on
adoption (adjusted for any prepaid or accrued lease expenses).

For leases that were classified as finance leases applying IAS 17, the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset
and the lease liability at the date of initial application is the carrying amount of the lease asset and lease
liability immediately before that date measured applying IAS 17. For those leases, the Group account for the
right-of-use asset and the lease liability applying IFRS 16 from the date of initial application.

**5. Financial risk management**

**Overview**

The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:

- credit risk,

- liquidity risk, and

- market risk.

This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s objectives,
policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Group’s management of capital. There is no
change of financial risk and financial risk management compared to consolidated financial statements as at
31 December 2018.

**Risk management framework**

The Group’s managing board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s
risk management framework, and development and monitoring of the Group’s risk management policies.

The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to
set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management
policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities.
The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to maintain a disciplined
and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.

The finance function monitors compliance with the Group’s risk management policies and procedures, and
provides top management with feedback regarding the performance of the framework in relation to the risk
faced by the Group.

**a)** **Credit risk**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument
fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers,
contract assets, cash and cash equivalents held at banks, loans and off-balance sheet guarantees.

Further disclosure relating to credit risk is presented in the note 22.

**_Trade and other receivables (including contract assets)_**

The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The Group assesses that it has no significant concentration of credit risk due to its exposure to a broad
customer base in each service line. No concentration of credit risk on a geographical basis is assessed as

material. The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure for each customer including services
disconnection procedure.

The Group’s risk procedure limits the credit risk through short credit period available (invoices are due for
payment within 15 days from the date of issue) and 3 levels of dunning letters in different time intervals. The
Group outsourced collection activities of all receivables which are overdue more than 6 months to collection
company.

**_Cash and cash equivalents_**

The Group held cash and cash equivalents of EUR 250,058 thousand as 31 December 2019 (31 December
2018: EUR 43,430 thousand) with reputable local commercial banks, which represents its maximum credit
exposure on these assets. Out of the total amount of cash and cash equivalents, the amount of EUR
207 million is placed on escrow account for the purpose of the acquisition of Tele2 (note 29). Management
actively monitors credit risk exposure and given that the Group only has invested in bank deposits
management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.

**b)** **Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its
financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group’s approach to
managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its
liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or
risking damage to the Group’s reputation.

The Group’s policy on liquidity is to maintain sufficient liquid resources to meet its obligations as they fall
due, which has been achieved through appropriate bank arrangements (note 32). Typically, the Group seeks
to ensure that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected current liabilities as they fall due, including
the servicing of financial obligations; this excludes the potential impact of extreme circumstances that cannot
reasonably be predicted, such as natural disasters.

The Group has covenants relating to Revolving Credit Facility and bonds. Covenants relating to bonds are
active only when the Group decides to issue new bonds or refinance old one. Covenants relating to RCF are
monitored regularly (note 32).

The liquidity table presenting the contractual maturities of financial liabilities at undiscounted amounts is
presented in the note 22.

**c)** **Market risk**

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity
prices will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of
market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while
optimizing the return.

_i)_ _Currency risk_

Currency risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognized assets or liabilities are denominated
in a currency that is not the functional currency of the Group entity holding the asset or obligation.

Different entities within the Group have different functional currencies, based on the underlying economic
conditions of their operations. Other than Euro, which is the Company’s functional currency, the Group’s
subsidiaries have local functional currencies: Serbian dinar (“RSD”), Croatian kuna (“HRK”) and Swiss
franc (“CHF”). Accordingly, the main exposure to currency risk comes from relates to purchases and
borrowings which are denominated in Euros and US dollars, while a significant share of the Group’s revenue
is denominated in Serbian dinars. The Group has exposure to currency fluctuation (depreciation) of RSD

(Serbian dinar) to Euro given that it has significant operations through SBB Serbia for which RSD is the
functional currency and that has significant borrowings in Euro. The Group’s currency risk policy for this
exposure is implemented through regular price adjustments on the Serbian market, following the depreciation
of Serbian dinar against Euro.

The following table presents sensitivities of profit or loss and equity to reasonably possible changes in
exchange rates applied at the end of the reporting period relative to the functional currency of the respective
Group entities, with all other variables held constant:

The Group is not in a position to effectively mitigate all currency risks due to absence of relevant financial
products in the countries of operations (e.g. Serbia).

_ii)_ _Price risk_

The Group is not exposed to material price risks on its financial instruments.

_iii) Interest rate risk_

The Group’s cash flow interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings, loans to related parties issued at
variable rates and lease liabilities, whereas the borrowings at the fixed rate are exposed to fair value risk
nevertheless it does not impact the financial statements as these borrowings are measured at amortised cost.
The Group closely monitors current market rates in order to minimize negative effects of significant
movements in market rates. The Group does not use these instruments for speculative purposes.

As at 31 December 2019, if interest rates on currency denominated borrowings (with floating rate) had been
1% higher with all other variables held constant, net profit for the year would have been EUR 4,289 thousand
lower (2018: EUR 3,596 thousand).

sustain future development of the business. The Group’s performance management is focused on generating
budgeted Adjusted EBITDA as well as maintaining overall liquidity position to repay the financial debt (note
22). An important key performance indicator for the communication with investors, analysts, and rating
agencies is Net leverage (calculated as Adjusted Net Debt to Annualized Last Two Quarters Adjusted Pro
Forma EBITDA). This ratio stood at 4.71x at December 31, 2019 (December 31, 2018: 4.88x). Annualized
Last Two Quarters Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Debt are non-GAAP figures not governed by
International Financial Reporting Standards, and their definition and calculation may vary from one company
to another.

Annualized Last Two Quarters Proforma Adjusted EBITDA represents Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in
note 7) adjusted for the reasonably anticipated synergies and cost savings from acquired companies, mainly
Tele2, as though the full effect of synergies and cost savings were realized on the first day of the relevant
period.

Adjusted Net Debt represents total debt of the Group adjusted by adjusted cash and cash equivalents and
IFRS 16 effects.

Adjusted cash and cash equivalents represent cash and cash equivalents adjusted by cash used for acquisition
of Tele2 and received bond premia.

The objective of the Group to keep Net leverage ratio below 5x as of the reporting date.

There is no change in respect of the capital management compared to consolidated financial statements as at
31 December 2018.

The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going
concern in order to provide returns for investors and to maintain an optimal liquidity position.

**6. Critical accounting estimates and judgments**

The consolidated financial statements require management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and
expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors,
including industry practices and expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are
revised and in any future periods affected.

Judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial
statements and estimates that can cause a significant adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and
liabilities within the next financial year included:

**6. Critical accounting estimates and judgments (continued)**

- Impairment of goodwill

The Group tests annually whether goodwill with indefinite useful life, suffer any impairment in accordance
with the Group’s accounting policy. Discounted cash flow method for annual impairment testing is based on
management assumptions on projected revenue growth and market research for the relevant markets,
competitive environment and management strategy for the next five years (note 20).

- Contractual customer relationships

The Group tests annually impairment indicators of contractual customer relationships. Discounted cash flow
method is based on management assumptions on projected revenue growth and market research for the
relevant markets, competitive environment and management strategy for the next five years.

- Expected credit loss

The calculation and measurement of expected credit loss in relation to trade receivables and contract assets is
an area where significant judgement is required to select an appropriate methodology, models and data inputs.
Details of ECL measurement methodology are disclosed in note 3(e). In the calculation of the default rate,
the Group’s models predominantly use historical information which is derived from the Group’s systems of
market data.

- Recognition of revenue and allocation of transaction price

The Group is determining and allocating the transaction prices to separate performance obligations in the
contract; the allocation is based on the reference to their relative standalone selling prices that could be
obtained if the promised goods and services were sold individually in a separate transaction. The standalone
selling prices are determined based on the list prices at which the Group sells handsets and telecommunication
services, if sold separately.

- Advertising and media selling

The Group recognized revenue from advertising and media selling on gross basis, i.e. acting as principal. In
arriving to that conclusion, the management has taken into consideration guidance of IFRS 15 on principle
vs agent as well as local industry practice. The main assumptions taken by management are that the Group
control the price and service. Additionally, local industry practice for the similar companies and the same
reporting framework, is to act as principals.

**7. Operating segments**

Operating segments are components that engage in business activities that may earn revenues or incur expenses
as a result of the services provided. Segment information is provided partially on the basis of geographic areas
and partially based on an organizational structure, being the basis on which the Group manages its operations.
Operating results of segments are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (CODM) and
discrete financial information is available on that level. Revenue is attributed to a country based on the location
of the sub-group reporting the revenue.

The functions of CODM are performed by the Managing directors of the Group.

The Group has five operating segments, four in cable and internet and one in media business line, which are
the Group’s strategic divisions. Cable strategic divisions for each of key markets, offer similar services and are
managed jointly since they have unified service development and marketing strategy. Media segment
represents content operating. For each of the strategic divisions, the CODM reviews internal management
reports on at least monthly basis. The reportable segments equal the operating segments thus no aggregation
of operating segments was performed for the reporting purposes.

The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group’s reportable segments.

**7. Operating segments (continued)**

- Serbia Group includes cable operations in Serbia and DTH (satellite TV) operations in Macedonia. Satellite
operations in Macedonia account for minor part of the overall operations of Serbia Group segment,

- Slovenia Group includes cable and DTH operations and mobile telephony services in Slovenia,

- Bosnia Group includes cable and DTH operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina,

- Montenegro Group includes cable and DTH operations in Montenegro (Montenegro is viewed as segment
after acquisition of M-kabl d.o.o. in 2016, as before this acquisition the Group did not have cable operations
in Montenegro),

- Media Group includes media (including advertising) and content operations in the region. This segment
includes the results of our media and content business in the former Yugoslav region including the results
of N1 Info, Grand Production, Orlando Kids, Nova TV, Nova M and Nova BH, as well as Direct Media.

- Other segments includes our other operating business, such as Solford and non-operating holding
companies (United Group B.V., Adria Cable B.V., Adria Serbia Holdco B.V., Slovenia Broadband
S.A.R.L.). Revenue reported in other is mainly generated by Solford.

There were no changes in relation to composition of segments and measurement of segment profit/loss
comparing to consolidated financial statements for 2018.

Information regarding the results of each reportable segment is included below. Performance is measured
based on segment earnings before net finance cost, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and
Adjusted EBITDA, as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the Group’s
management.

EBITDA is a supplemental measure of financial performance that is not required by, or presented in
accordance with IFRS. “EBITDA” is defined by the Group as Profit/(Loss) for the period plus income tax
(benefit)/expense, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and net finance costs.

Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for shareholder-related costs, legal and advisory—M&A
related costs, group restructuring costs, income from the disposal of companies, impairment charges for
obsolete equipment in Slovenia, other management-related costs, specific penalties, additional impact of
application of new standards (just for transitory period) and other non-core operating expenses, which Group
views as non-operating and not recurring to the operations of the Group (note 17).

Segment Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (note 17) is used to measure performance as management
believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to
other entities that operate within these industries.

(a) Description of products and services from which each reportable segment derives its revenue

The Group’s main activities are providing of Video, Data and Voice services to subscribers in the countries of
South-East Europe. The Group operates in Serbia providing Video, Data and Voice services, as well as in four
other countries: Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Macedonia providing Video and Data
services.

Video service include provision of TV channel mix and IP Video streaming services, which is marketed into
basic, extended and premium packages. TV mix range from 60 to over 100 TV channels.

Data service comprise internet packages for residential and business customers, as well as various
supplementary services for business customers (connectivity and managed services, data centre and cloud
services).

Voice service relates to fixed line services to residential and business customers.

Mobile phone services relate to post-paid, prepaid, roaming and wholesale services provided to customers.

**7. Operating segments (continued)**

Media Group includes content operations in the entire former Yugoslav region. Content operations represent
carriage fee revenue that relates to sales of pay-tv channel to other cable operators and advertising revenue
from terrestrial TV stations. The Group is the owner of pay-tv channels including brands like “Sport Klub”,
movie channel “Cinemania”, children channels “Ultra” and “Orlando” and music channel “Grand”, as well
as terrestrial TV stations Nova TV, Nova M and Nova BH. In addition to this, Direct Media group provides
advertising and media services to companies in the region.

(b) Factors that management used to identify the reportable segments

Four of the Group’s business segments are mainly based on the Group’s geographic regions, Serbia, Slovenia,
Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro, and the other business segment is broadly based on product
distribution. They are managed separately because each business unit requires different marketing strategies
and service level.

(c) Measurement of operating segment profit or loss.

The CODM reviews financial information prepared based on IFRS adjusted to meet the requirements of
internal reporting. Such financial information differs in certain aspects from IFRS:

i. Management consolidation adjustments can differ from the ones required by IFRS

ii. non-IFRS profit measures (such as earnings before income tax, depreciation and amortization—
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and capital expenditure (CAPEX)) are also included in the segment report.
Capital expenditures represents purchases of tangible and intangible assets, consisting primarily of set
top box purchases and other customer capital expenditure, installations (including capitalized labour
costs), cable and mobile network build out, upgrades, maintenance and other investments, computer
hardware and software and content rights.

CODM evaluates performance of each segment based on revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA and other
key performance indicators (e.g. average revenue per user, CAPEX) and does not regularly review assets and
liabilities of the segments.

**16. Income tax (continued)**

SBB and Telemach d.o.o., Slovenia are entities which primarily utilise tax losses and use tax holiday for
investments in plant and equipment. During 2016, SBB managed to satisfy conditions to apply for another
10 years cycle of tax holiday, i.e. to employ 100 employees and invest more than EUR 8.5m. In 2019, SBB is
utilizing the tax holiday which reduces its nominal income tax liability by 64.63%, and which expires in 10 years
(in 2025).

SBB is eligible for investment incentives (tax holiday) according to Article 50a to 50i Serbian Corporate
Income Tax (CIT). For SBB this is a second use of this type of investment tax credit. The company met
required conditions to use an investment tax credit for the second time in 2016. The investment tax credit is
applied for ten years. Start of investment in fixed assets for the second investment tax credit is 1 January 2016.
Each year the proportion for this investment needs to be calculated. Calculation of this percentage represent
the ratio of investment in fixed assets that meet requirements from Serbian CIT art 50a to 50i (certain assets
need to be excluded such as aircraft and watercrafts, passenger cars, furniture and assets that hasn’t been paid
during the cumulative period) and total investment in fix assets (for period from 1 January 2016—according
to invested amount in fixed assets and for previous period according to fixed amount of assets book value).
The percentage which can be apply as investment tax credit on calculated CIT is changing every year.

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of tax losses, because it is more likely than not that
future taxable profit will not be available against which the Group can use the benefits therefrom. Overview of

**Impairment testing for goodwill**

In 2019, the Group tested the value of goodwill allocated to its CGUs or groups of CGUs applying valuation
methods consistent with previous years. Results of an impairment test show that the recoverable amount of
CGU or groups of CGUs tested exceeded their carrying value (including goodwill). The recoverable amount
is determined as the higher of the value in use determined by the discounted value of future cash flows
(Discounted Cash Flow method (DCF)) and the fair value (less costs to sell), determined on the basis of
market data (stock market prices, comparable listed companies, comparison with the value attributed to
similar assets or companies in recent acquisition transactions). For a description of the methods used for the
impairment test, please refer to note 3(j).

Definition of the Group’s CGU or group of CGUs correlates to the Group’s operating segment.

The recoverable amount of each operating segment is determined using value-in-use calculations. These
calculations use post-tax cash flow projections based on five-year financial budget. Cash flow beyond the
five-year period is calculated on a perpetuity basis. The post -tax cash flows were discounted using the posttax rate to ensure consistency.

**Key assumptions used for discounted cash flow projections**

Key assumptions used in the calculation of recoverable amounts are weighted average cost of capital, terminal
value growth rate, budgeted Adjusted EBITDA growth rate and budgeted Adjusted EBITDA margin. These
assumptions are as follows:

(1) Weighted average cost of capital, calculated on post-tax basis

WACC is calculated as weighted average of post-tax cost of equity and post-tax cost of debt, using peer
groups’ capital structure as weights, betas used are post-tax and based on industry reports as of 31 December
2019 and leveraged by the debt margin taken from comparable companies. Assumptions used for value-in-use
calculations (refer to the above table) changed to reflect current business environment as more information
became available to the Group.

The cash flow projections included specific estimates for five years and a terminal growth rate thereafter. The
terminal growth rate was determined based on management’s estimate of the long-term compound annual
Adjusted EBITDA growth rate, consistent with the assumptions that a market participant would make.

Budgeted Adjusted EBITDA was estimated taking into account past experience, adjusted as follows:

- Revenue growth was projected taking into account the growth levels over the past three years and market
research for the relevant markets, competitive environment and management strategy for the next five years.

- Corporate costs not included in individual CGU. Therefore, it shows the cash outflows from the continuing
use of the assets.

**Sensitivity analysis**

The management has identified that there are no reasonably possible changes in a key business and valuation
assumptions in Serbia Group, Slovenia Group and Media Group which could cause the carrying amount to
exceed the recoverable amount.

For Bosnia Group, if WACC would increase for 2% carrying amount would exceed the recoverable amount
by EUR 5,199 thousand.

For Montenegro Group, if WACC would increase for 2% carrying amount would exceed the recoverable
amount by EUR 890 thousand.

**21. Business combinations**

During the period ended 31 December 2019, the Group completed acquisition of business from third parties
as presented below.

The Group allocated goodwill from the acquisitions of Nova TV d.o.o. and Direct Media Group to the
existing reporting segment based on synergies expected from the acquisition mainly due to opportunities for
cross selling additional services which is expected to lead to increase of revenues and cost reduction. These are
expected from enhanced ownership of local content, improving the Group’s production capabilities, cost
synergy opportunity through joint production. Media operating segment, to which goodwill from the
acquisitions of Nova TV d.o.o. and Direct Media Group will be allocated, represents the lowest level at which
it will be managed and monitored.

The identification and valuation of identifiable intangible assets and property, plant and equipment involved
management judgment and was performed with the assistance of valuation experts.

In 2018, the newly acquired companies contributed consolidated revenue of the Group in total amount of
EUR 58,016 thousand and consolidated net profit in total amount of EUR 3,209 thousand. Following table

Due to the large number of customers and the high level of diversification of the trade and other receivables,
including contract assets, the default of any single debtor would not impose any significant consequences in
respect of the consolidated financial statements.

The contract assets are all not yet due as at 31 December 2019 and 31 December 2018. The default rate
applied to calculated the ECL in relation to contract assets is the same as applied to trade receivables not due
0.2%-2.6% (2018: .2%-2.6%).

Total amount of long-term loans relates to loan to Totalna Televizija d.o.o. At 31 December 2018, loan was
assessed as stage 2. At 31 December 2019 this loan is considered as non-performing as principal repayments
are more than 90 days past due and loss allowance is based on lifetime ECL.

_Short term loans and deposits_

A loss allowance in relation to short term loans and deposits is determined individually for each balance. In
order to assess credit risk publicly available information to determine default rates. No exposure to any
significant credit risk was identified, so the calculation of the loss allowances resulted in immaterial amounts.

_Cash and cash equivalents_

The Group holds cash in a number of banks in order to avoid concentration risk. A loss allowance in relation
to cash and cash equivalents is determined individually for each balance with a given financial institution. In

consummation of the Group acquisition represented an Exit under the LTIS Agreement.

- The Group has recognized the effects of the LTIS Agreement in its consolidated financial statements for
the period ending 31 December 2019, as equity-settled Group Share-based payment transaction under
IFRS 2—Share-based payment—as LTIS Agreement is structured in a Group context where multiple
Group entities receive services from employees. It also provides the responsibility of shareholders to settle
the bonus (share-based payment) to employees who are providing services to several group companies.

- The bonus amount under the LTIS Agreement at closing amounted to EUR 54,468 thousand, which relates
to the period of services provided from the LTIS Agreement signing to the grant date when all parties will
have shared understanding of key conditions pertaining LTIS Agreement. The service period ended
31 August 2019. The Group recognized in its consolidated financial statements for the period ending
31 December 2019 related expense in the amount of EUR 21,659 thousand, which corresponds to the
eligible managers’ period of service from LTIS Agreement signing to the end of the reporting period.

- From the perspective of the Group financial performance for the period ending 31 December 2018, the
recognition of the transaction resulted in a lower reported net profit of the Group, in the amount of
EUR 32,809 thousand. The same amount of EUR 32,809 thousand, as guided by IFRS 2, the Group
recognized an increase in equity (Contribution from shareholder). The transaction is a non-cash, no
recourse transaction without an impact on the financial position of the Group.

- From the perspective of the Group financial performance for the period ending 31 December 2019, the
recognition of the transaction resulted in a lower reported net profit of the Group, in the amount of
EUR 21,659 thousand. The same amount of EUR 21,659 thousand, as guided by IFRS 2, the Group

**v)** **Additional payment**

In addition to the LTIS Agreement, the shareholders of Adria Luxco and management have agreed an
additional payment in the amount of 49,9 million EUR. The amount of the additional payment was not
directly related to the value of the Company’s equity, or that of its ultimate parent, and was not paid in
securities, but was determined as a result of negotiations as a discretionary lump sum amount paid in cash to
the management at closing.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**36. Related parties (continued)**

The Group believes that this additional payment could be regarded as a short-term employee benefit under
IAS 19, however, it is the Group’s accounting policy, where external shareholders have the obligation of
settling the payment for such benefits, without recourse from the Group, and absent an IFRS requirement,
not to attribute related expense to the consolidated financial statements.

**37. Contingent liabilities**

As at 31 December 2019, the Group is involved in a number of legal cases in the total amount claimed of
EUR 182,242 thousand (31 December 2018: EUR 119,372 thousand).

The Group management recognized provisions for legal cases in the amount of EUR 19,712 thousand
representing its assessment of the most likely outcome of the cases (note 31) and believes that any disclosure
of the amounts provided on a case-by-case basis could seriously harm the Group’s position, but provides
details of the provisions recorded by categories of litigation as reflected below. Ultimate outcome of the cases
is inherently uncertain and may differ from the best estimate of the Group management as discussed below.

For disputes for the outcome of which no provisions were created by the Group, the Group management,
supported by legal teams, assesses the favourable outcome to be probable (more likely than not). Below are
presented litigations which could have significant impact on the Group.

1. In 2016, BS Group d.o.o., Brus raised legal case against the Group. Subject of the dispute is violation of
producer’s rights. According to the plaintiff, the Group violated territorial restriction of the contract by
broadcasting certain movies on territories which were not listed in the contract. Total value of dispute
amounts to EUR 25,000 thousand. The final outcome of the case will depend on the Court’s opinion on
legal issues related to the basis of the request and the standing of the parties. The Group assessed that it
is not probable that this proceeding will result in a negative outcome that would adversely impact on its
financial position, therefore no provision has been recognised.

2. In September 2019, JKP Beogradske elektrane raised legal case against the Group. Subject of the dispute
is indemnity for using their infrastructure. Total value of dispute amounts to EUR 10,000 thousand. The
Group assessed that it is not probable that this proceeding will result in a negative outcome that would
adversely impact on its financial position, therefore no provision has been recognised.

3. In March 2020, EPS Distribucija raised legal case against the Group. Subject of the dispute is indemnity
for using their infrastructure. Total value of dispute amounts to EUR 1,000 thousand. The Group
assessed that it is not probable that this proceeding will result in a negative outcome that would adversely
impact on its financial position, therefore no provision has been recognised.

_Investigation of the Serbian Commission for Protection of Competition in Serbia_

In November 2018 the Serbian Commission for Protection of Competition (“CPC”) issued a preliminary
notice stating that (i) it believed SBB holds a dominant position in the retail market for distributing media
content; (ii) price increases made by SBB were not justified by actual costs; and (iii) as a result, SBB may have
abused a dominant position through excessive pricing. On 15 May 2019 CPC issued decision on suspension of
further investigation.

_Investigation of Tax Authority in Serbia_

On 27 December 2017, the Serbian Ministry of Finance Tax Authority (the “Serbian Tax Authority”) started
tax investigation of SBB for the year ended 31 December 2012. According to the Serbian Tax Authority’s
decision issued in March 2019, it has recharacterized interest payments made by SBB Serbia under an
intragroup loan agreement (and certain other transactions) as dividends, which would have been subject to a
5% withholding tax. Total liability determined amounts to EUR 21 million, including the late interest. The
management assessment, supported by analysis done by external consultants (both legal and tax experts) is
that there is no ground for the claim as it is not substantiated by the evidence and regulation. The Group
appealed to this decision and received approval for postponing of payment until resolution of appeal.

_Legal cases in Slovenia_

1. The award of 5 MHz on 2100 MHz spectrum frequency within its 3G licenses in 2008 to Tušmobil (now
Telemach Slovenia) is currently subject of judicial review before the Administrative Court against the
decision issued by the Slovenian Agency for Communication Networks and Services (“Agency”). In
court, Telemach Slovenia is challenging Agency’s decision of May 2019, by which the Agency in the
renewed frequencies allotment procedure has rejected Tušmobil’s request for allocation of said
radiofrequencies and reversed its allotment decision of 2008, coming into the effect as of 31 December
2019. Based on Telemach Slovenia’s proposal, in June 2019, the Administrative Court issued an interim
injunction and therewith stayed the Agency’s decision of May 2019 until the court reaches a final decision
on Telemach’s lawsuit against Agency’s decision of May 2019. The procedure before the Administrative
Court concerning the Telemach Slovenia’s lawsuit is pending. Loss of the described frequency licence
would lead to capacity reduction, which might cause decrease in quality of service in certain areas.
However, additional frequencies granted in 2016 (and currently used by Telemach Slovenia) would
support the Group to mitigate the impact of any potential loss of 3G frequencies due to a renewal of the
licence allocation procedure or other revocation or impairment of the 3G license that was granted in 2008.

2. From 2012 onwards, the Slovenian Association of Composers and Authors (“SAZAS”) commenced
many legal proceedings against all cable operators in Slovenia (including Telemach Slovenia) claiming
infringement of copyrights and damages for the cable retransmission of musical works. Up to now,
SAZAS initiated twenty-eight legal proceedings against Telemach Slovenia claiming copyright
remuneration for cable retransmission of music works for periods between October 2010 and
December 2015. In eighteen proceedings, courts already issued a final decision awarding SAZAS with
monthly remuneration amounting to approx. EUR 0.20 per subscriber for cable retransmission of music
works in TV and radio channels. On average, SAZAS was awarded with approx. 30%-40% of its original
claim. Telemach already complied with these final judgements and paid the awarded amounts to SAZAS,
while filed extraordinary legal means against courts’ final decisions which are for the present being
reviewed by the Constitutional Court (in nine cases) and Supreme Court of Slovenia (in one case). In five
proceedings, the court of first instance issued judgements, which were all appealed by both litigating
parties to the Higher Court, while five proceedings are still pending before the court of first instance.

3. In September 2018, the Slovenian Competition Protection Agency ruled that the Group’s acquisition of
United Media Distribution (then IKO Balkan) in 2012 is incompatible with competition rules. The
Slovenian Competition Protection Agency (hereinafter—the Agency) ordered the Group to divest the
activity of broadcasting Sport Klub (SK) TV channels within nine months and imposed a ban prohibiting
the Group from broadcasting sports TV channels in Slovenia for three years from the date of divestment
(with the exception of the existing Fight Channel). In October 2018, the Slovenian Supreme Court issued
our proposed interim injunction and stayed the implementation of the Agency’s divestment decision
until a final decision on the merits of this case has been issued. The lawsuit against the divestment decision
is pending. In addition, in a separate misdemeanour proceeding a fine of up to a legal maximum of 10%
of annual revenue of the Group could be imposed for each of the next two breaches: (i) filing of
concentration notification to the Agency with delay and (ii) breaching of the stand still obligation. In
May 2019, the Agency issued decision on misdemeanour procedure by which financial fine in the amount

of EUR 3.7 million was imposed. The Group appealed against the decision and seek to annul or change
decision in order to abolish the financial fine or at least lower it.

4. In February 2015, the Slovenian Competition Protection Agency initiated a proceeding regarding the
abuse of dominant market position by United Media Limited, IKO Balkan (now United Media
Distribution) and its Slovenian subsidiary IKO Media PRO d.o.o. (former subsidiary of the IKO
Balkan—liquidated in 2016) in the wholesale market for the supply of pay TV sports channels in Slovenia
for a period beginning around August 2012. This proceeding is currently still in its initial stages as no
statement of objections has been issued by the Slovenian Competition Protection Agency. If the Agency
in this procedure ruled that the dominant position existed and was abused a fine of up to the legal
maximum of 10% of annual revenue of the previously described companies involved in the procedure
could be imposed. The Group management, supported by its legal advisors, at this point assessed that it
is likely that fine could be imposed and that level of fine would not have material adverse impact on its
financial position.

_Legal cases in Bosnia_

_Minority shareholders of HS d.o.o., HKB d.o.o._

As a result of acquisition of subsidiaries in Bosnia, the Group assumed significant number of ongoing court
disputes. The disputes are initiated by the minority owners of companies HS d.o.o. and HKB d.o.o. which
claimed compensation for damages and cancellation of a share purchase transaction. The cases has been filed
against majority owners of HS d.o.o. and HKB d.o.o. for breaching minority shareholders’ rights. The
provisional quantum of indemnity sought by the minority shareholders is up to EUR 12,200 thousand
(including penalty interest rates and costs of the proceedings), which is determined, according to the Group
legal advisors, solely by plaintiffs. Based on the advice from legal advisors, the Group management has set
aside funds in escrow account for the purpose of settlement of cases.

_Other cases_

In October 2017 claim is raised against Telemach d.o.o. by Swiss non-profit organization AGICOA for unpaid
royalties. Telemach and Agicoa were not in the contractual relation for the period covered by the law. Agicoa
claims that Telemach is liable for royalties that had been due by the companies Telemach acquired on the
Bosnian market.

In October 2019 claim is raised against Telemach d.o.o., KT HS d.o.o., HKB Net d.o.o. and M&H Company
by UFR for unpaid royalties. Telemach and UFR (Association of filmmakers in Bosnia and Herzegovina)
were not in the contractual relation for the period covered by the law. UFR claims that Telemach is liable for
royalties that had been due by the companies Telemach acquired on the Bosnian market.

for a preliminary contribution of EUR 943 million subject to certain adjustments at closing date. The
transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals by the local competition authorities and is expected
to be completed in 2020. In any event of non-satisfaction of the Closing Condition, and if the transaction
agreed per the contract is not unwound, break fee up to EUR 20 million shall be applicable (Seller shall be
entitled to payment from the Purchaser—for loss of opportunity for the Seller).

On 23 January 2020, the Group issued bonds in the nominal amount of EUR 1,675 million. Bond is issued in
three tranches. First tranche in the nominal amount of EUR 600 million bears interest rate of 3.125% and
matures on 15 February 2026. Second tranche in the nominal amount of EUR 450 million bears floating
interest rate of 3M Euribor+3.25% and matures on 15 February 2026. Third tranche in the amount of
EUR 625 million bears interest rate of 3.625% and matures on 15 February 2028. Part of the issued bonds
will be used for the purpose of acquisition of BTC Group and the other part was used for redemption existing
bond of EUR 575 million which matures in 2022 and partial repayment of existing RCF.

_Other acquisitions_

The Group concluded agreements or signed binding offers to acquire stakes in following companies: EVJ
Elektroprom trgovina, KRS, Elcatel, Ansat Krsko, Panel and Tako lako for total preliminary consideration of
EUR 11,8 million subject to certain adjustments at closing dates. The transactions are subject to customary
regulatory approvals by the local competition authorities and is expected to be completed in 2020.

_COVID-19_

The existence of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was confirmed in early 2020 and has spread rapidly from
mainland China across the globe, causing disruptions to businesses and economic activity. Many governments
across the world have imposed travel restrictions, lock downs and social distancing with a view to reducing the
spread of the virus and hopefully minimizing the number of fatalities. The Group considers this outbreak to
be a non-adjusting post balance sheet event.

Whilst inherently uncertain, and the management expects some impact to operations and performance but
currently does not believe that the COVID-19 outbreak will directly have a material adverse effect on the
Group’s financial condition or liquidity for the foreseeable future such that it is not appropriate to apply the
going concern principal to these financial statements.

The impact of this outbreak on macroeconomic forecasts and markets are expected to be incorporated into
the Group’s estimates of expected credit loss provisions and other impairments assessments in 2020, including
but not limited to: Goodwill, Property, plant and equipment, Intangible assets and programming rights.

Please also see disclosures in note 2(c) Going Concern.

The Group’s management holds that they are not aware of any other significant post balance sheet events that
could affect the consolidated financial statements for 31 December 2019 or require separate disclosure.

**FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**For the nine months ended 30 September 2020**

**All amounts are in thousand BGN, unless otherwise stated**

**3. Summary of significant accounting policies and significant events through the reporting period (continued)**

The same accounting policies and methods of calculation are applied in the present interim separate and
consolidated financial statements, as in the annual separate and consolidated financial statements of the
Company and the Group for the year ended 31 December 2019.

**3.2. Significant events during the reporting period**

As a preventive measure against the outburst of COVID-19 (Coronavirus) in Europe, on 13 March 2020 a
state of emergency was declared in the territory of Bulgaria. All visits in certain commercial establishments
such as restaurants, shopping centres, entertainment and gaming halls, etc. were suspended for two months.
On 23 March 2020 Measures and Actions during a State of Emergency Act was adopted, aimed at mitigating
the negative consequences of the epidemic on citizens and businesses. While the core activities of the Group
were not directly affected by these measures, certain negative impact on its financial position and performance
during the reporting period could be largely attributed to the COVID-19 related developments. Though no
reasonable estimate of the exact financial effect of the coronavirus outbreak can be made, the impacted items
of the profit and loss statement, statement of financial position and accounting estimates and judgments are
presented below.

Net impairment losses on financial and contract assets increased as a result of delays in customer payments
during the second quarter of the year, resulting respectively in higher ECL rates and increase in allowance for
impairment of trade and lease receivables measured by applying the IFRS 9 simplified approach. During the
third quarter of the year the receivables collectability improved and as at the reporting date and the subsequent
periods it is close to pre-coronavirus levels (refer to Note 5).

The coronavirus pandemic had a negative impact on the Mobile services revenue due to lower roaming
revenue, primarily as a result of coronavirus-induced travel restrictions. This was partially offset by decrease
in interconnect and roaming expenses. Further impact on service revenues are limited by the increased demand
for telecom services during the periods of coronavirus related restrictions.

During the reporting period the incremental borrowing rates applicable to the the Group lease liabilities were
reconsidered and no significant changes to the pre-coronavirus rates were determined. The other critical
accounting estimates and judgements disclosed in the annual financial statements for the year ended
31 December 2019 were evaluated as not impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.

Potential prolonged recession and a deepening crisis could impact on growth prospects, customer spending
and collection, and may result in assumptions and estimates that could trigger material adjustments to the
carrying value of assets and liabilities in the future. In particular, management expects the assumptions and
estimates used in determining impairment of Trade and other receivables, Contract assets, Property, plant
and equipment, Intangible assets, Right-of-use assets and valuation of Investment property, and the related
Deferred tax assets and liabilities to be affected. Nevertheless, at the date of these financial statements the
Company continues to generate profits and sufficient cash from operations, supporting its activities. The
directors, in light of their assessment of expected future cash flows are satisfied that the Company will be able
to meet its obligations as they fall due for a period of at least 12 months from the reporting date. Therefore the
Company continues to apply the going concern basis of preparation.

On July 31, 2020 United Group Bulgaria EOOD granted to VIVACOM a related party loan with maturity of
10 years and bullet repayment at maturity. With the funds received, VIVACOM has prepaid all liabilities
under the SFA. As a result, VIVACOM’s long-term debt obligation to third-party financing institutions
stipulating 6-month repayment schedules and finally due in 2023 was replaced by a related party loan due
2030 which enables better liquidity management compared to the previous SFA exposure.

**All amounts are in thousand BGN, unless otherwise stated**

**5. Trade and other receivables and contract assets (continued)**

Trade receivables for the consolidated and for the separate financial statements as of 31 December 2019
include respectively BGN 60,179 thousand and BGN 59,152 thousand representing the remaining cash and
cash equivalents at CCB, due to the bankruptcy proceedings discussed in Note 4. The nominal value of the
cash accounts at CCB as of 31 December 2019 is respectively BGN 66,089 thousand and
BGN 65,062 thousand for the Group and the Company. Their net book value as of 31
December 2019 amounts to BGN 12,403 thousand and BGN 12,232 thousand for the consolidated and for
the separate financial statements, respectively, and the accumulated impairment is respectively
BGN 47,776 thousand and BGN 46,920 thousand.

During the reporting period part of the receivables of BTC representing cash and cash equivalents at CCB
was utilized by NURTS Bulgaria for the settlement of the issues between CCB and NURTS related to the
set-off of NURTS obligations to CCB under a bond issued by NURTS Bulgaria EAD in 2013, as disclosed in
Note 28. The remaining receivables of BTC and BTC Net representing cash and cash equivalents at CCB were
assigned to InterV Investment S.à r.l. for cash consideration equal to their net book value.

Based on the data disclosed by Bulgarian Deposit Insurance Fund the management has made an assessment
of the collectability of the cash in CCB which was estimated in 2020 to approximate 21% (19% as of
31 December 2019). As a result, impairment related to the receivables representing cash at CCB amounting to
BGN 1,248 thousand for the Group and BGN 1,227 thousand for the Company has been reversed and
included under Net impairment losses on financial and contract assets for 2020.

The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime
expected loss allowance for the majority of the trade receivables and all lease receivables. The expected loss
rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over a period of 24 months before 30 September 2020 and
31 December 2019 respectively and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period.
The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forwardlooking information on macroeconomic
factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables. On that basis, the loss allowance as at
30 September 2020 and 31 December 2019 was determined as follows for trade and lease receivables:

Incremental costs of obtaining a contract are additional costs that would have not been incurred had the
contract not been concluded. They comprise mainly sales commission paid to employees and third-party
retailers. Costs to fulfill a contract are costs relating directly to a contract that are incurred after contract
inception and serve the purpose of fulfilling the contract but are incurred prior to fulfillment and cannot be
capitalized under any other standard. The capitalized contract costs are recognised in the profit or loss as: 1)
depreciation and amortization on a straight-line basis over the minimum enforceable contract period, or 2)
other operating expenses when impairment loss is recognized, if their carrying amount exceeds the remaining
amount of consideration that the Group expects to receive, less the costs that relate directly to providing the
goods or services that have not been recognized as expenses.

30 September 2020 amounted to BGN 6,850 thousand, and as of 31 December 2019 their net book value was
BGN 7,007 thousand.

**Measurement of fair value**

_Fair value hierarchy_

Land is measured at fair value, in accordance with the revaluation model of IAS 16. The fair value of land was
determined as at 31 December 2018 by external, independent property valuers, having appropriate recognized
professional qualification and recent experience in the location and category of the property being valued.

The fair value measurement for land of BGN 5,361 thousand has been categorised as a Level 3 fair value
based on the inputs to the valuation technique used.

_Valuation technique and significant unobservable inputs_

The valuation technique used is Market comparison — the fair value is based on the market price of properties
with similar location and category. At the date of valuation no active market existed and the market value was
determined based on offers to sell similar plots under the assumption that these are the end prices. The offered
prices have been adjusted with: discount rate ranging from 10% to 15% to reflect the actual reduction in the
offered price, based on the trends of actual transactions; adjustment coefficients, derived on the basis of
characteristics of the respective plots like size, environmental and geomorphologic condition, level of
development and transport accessibility, and improvements of the land. The estimated fair value of the
individual properties would increase/(decrease) had the respective discount rate were lower/(higher) and the
adjustments coefficients were higher/(lower).

The fair value of the investment properties was determined as at 31 December 2019 by external, independent
property valuers, having appropriate recognized professional qualification and experience.

The investment properties realized during the reporting period were sold above or close to their fair value in
the consolidated financial statements. The Group is regularly monitoring the price trends and transaction
volumes on the real estate market. As per the available data from an expert assessment of independent property
valuers the fair value of the individual real estates of the Group close to the reporting date varies in the range
of 0.85-1.15 compared to their carrying amount. The real estates in big cities, contributing the substantial
value of the Group investment property portfolio mark increase in fair value snice the last valuation as of
31 December 2019. Based on the above and considering the publicly available information for the price
movements of real estates, and the nature of the owned by the Group investment properties (unique location,
property type, etc.), Management believes that COVID pandemic (Note 3.2) has not affected significantly the
fair value of the investment property of the Group as at the reporting date.

As disclosed in note 15 BTC has signed an agreement to secure payments related to the Parent company’s
liabilities under the the SFA by establishing a pledge on real estate properties presented as investment property,
which value as of 30 September 2020 amounted to BGN 13,314 thousand in the consolidated financial
statements and BGN 1,091 thousand in the separate financial statements (31 December 2019:
BGN 13,314 thousand in the consolidated financial statements and BGN 1,078 thousand in the separate
financial statements).

In November 2013 BTC announced the successful completion of its debut bond offering of €400 million
6[5]∕8 % Senior Secured Notes due 2018 on the Irish Stock Exchange pursuant to Rule 144A / Regulation S (the
“Notes”). The proceeds from the bond offering were used by the Company to repay its existing indebtedness
under the amended and restated loan agreement in full. The interest on the Notes was payable semi-annually
on May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing May 15, 2014. In relation to the admission of the
Notes the Company received a credit rating of B1 by Moody’s and BB- by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services.
On 29 March 2018 and 16 May 2018 respectively Moody’s upgraded the long-term corporate credit rating of
the Company to Ba3 and S&P Global Ratings reconfirmed it as BB- and in November 2019 both agencies
placed the corporate credit ratings on review. On 27 March 2020 S&P Global Ratings downgraded the
corporate credit rating to B+ and on 30 September 2020 lowered it to B, and withdrew the rating at
VIVACOM’s request.

BTC underwent a consent solicitation procedure for a waiver of the existing change of control provisions and
amendment of certain definitions and ratios applicable to the Notes. The procedure was initiated in relation
to the acquisition by VTL of 100% of the shares of InterV Investment S.a.r.l. On 13 June 2016, Vivacom
obtained the necessary consent of 87.43% of bondholders. The amendments of Notes’ provisions entered
into effect upon the execution of the first supplemental indenture on June 10, 2016 which became operative
on 7 September 2016, when all the conditions precedent in the first supplemental indenture were either satisfied
or waived.

Simultaneously with the bond offering BTC has concluded EUR 35 million Revolving Credit Facility with
Societe Generale Expressbank AD under which the Company may borrow funds for the repayment of its debt
under the amended and restated loan agreement, financing of its working capital purposes and issue of bank
guarantees and letters of credit. The RCF was initially agreed to be available up to 30 November 2016. The
interest on the principal amounts owing by the Company under the RCF is payable monthly and was initially
agreed to be the aggregate of 1 month EURIBOR plus a margin of 4% per year. Effective from 26 May 2014
the margin was reduced to 3,75% per year and from 14 November 2016 the margin was further reduced to
1,45% per year and the term was extended to 31 May 2018.

On 22 December 2017 the Company entered into an up to EUR 365 million Senior Facilities Agreement
(SFA) arranged by Citibank N.A., London Branch and VTB Bank (Deutschland) AG (currently VTB Bank
(Europe) SE). The purpose of the facility was to refinance all amounts due under the Existing HY Bonds,
payment of fees and costs under the facility and capital expenditure in respect of the Company’s investment
and development program. The SFA comprised of a term loan Facility A, term loan Facility B, a Short-term

Facility and a Revolving Facility. The maximum tenor was 5.25 years after the first Utilization under the SFA,
which occurred on 14 April 2018. The interest on the facilities was based on EURIBOR plus a Margin between
1.25 and 3.75 per cent per annum.

The liabilities of the Company under the SFA were guaranteed by BTC Net EOOD (subsidiary) and Viva
Telecom Bulgaria OOD (parent of the Company) and were further secured by: 1) a non-possessory pledge in
accordance with the Special Pledges Act on the going concern of the Company, which included among other
receivables of the Company under certain bank accounts, insurance policies, related parties and customer
receivables, as well as certain tangible and intangible assets (including trademarks), inventory and real estates
of the Company; 2) a non-possessory pledge in accordance with the Special Pledges Act over the going concern
of BTC Net, which included among other assets the receivables of BTC Net under certain bank accounts; 3)
a non-possessory pledge in accordance with the Special Pledges Act over the going concern of Viva Telecom
Bulgaria OOD, which included among other assets the receivables of Viva Telecom Bulgaria EOOD under
certain bank accounts and the shares of the Company; 4) a non-possessory pledge in accordance with the
Special Pledges Act over the shares of the Company; 5) a pledge in accordance with the Agreements on
Financial Collateral Act over the shares of the Company; 6) a non-possessory pledge in accordance with the
Special Pledges Act over the shares of BTC Net and a possessory pledge over the shares of NURTS Bulgaria
EAD.

On 19 April 2018 the Company successfully completed the refinancing of its Notes ahead of their maturity
date and has delisted the Notes from the Official List and from trading on the Main Securities Market of the
Irish Stock Exchange. As of the date of these financial statements the Company has deregistered the relevant
securities under the Notes.

Simultaneously with the SFA the Company extended the maturity of the Existing EUR 35 million Revolving
Credit Facility (RCF)with Societe Generale Expressbank AD to 18 April 2021 and reduced the applicable
Margin to between 1.05 and 1.75 per cent per annum. The Company has established the respective securities
under the extended RCF on a pari passu basis by the same scope and type of security provided by the
Company under the SFA.

On 31 July 2020 United Group Bulgaria EOOD granted related party loan to BTC and with the received
funds BTC successfully prepaid all liabilities under the SFA and the above referred securities under the SFA
are in the course of deregistration. The outstanding principal amount of the related party loan is due in
10 years. The applicable interest is payable quarterly in arrears and is negotiated to be initially equal to 4.65
per cent per annum and following the completion of a third party transfer pricing study — to such per cent
per annum determined thereunder.

Simultaneously with the repayment of the SFA, BTC also terminated the Revolving Credit Facility which
securities are currently in the course of deregistration.

**Lease liabilities**

The Group’s lease portfolio mainly consists of administrative and commercial buildings, fixed and mobile site
rentals, network infrastructure, software and vehicles.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities for different taxable entities are not offset as they can not be settled on a net
basis and it is not expected that the assets will be realised and the liabilities will be settled simultaneously in the
future.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in
the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The deferred tax assets
and liabilities as of 30 September 2020 and 31 December 2019 are calculated in these financial statements at
10% tax rate which has been effective since 1 January 2007.

As of 31 December 2019 the last period audited by the tax authorities for BTC was 2013. During the reporting
period a tax assessment act has been issued for a tax audit, covering the period January 2017—December 2019
in respect of corporate tax, and no tax liabilities has been assessed.

The last period audited by the tax authorities for BTC Net is 2014.

The last period audited by the tax authorities for NURTS Bulgaria and NURTS Digital is 2013.

subsidiary NURTS Digital EAD. Principal activities are as follows:

- NURTS business—TV and radio broadcasting, collocation services and maintenance of telecom
infrastructure.

The Managing Board assesses the performance of the business segments based on a measure of gross margin.

principal and interest on loan provided by BTC to the subsidiary entity. The applicable interest rate as of the
reporting date is the aggregate of 12M Euribor plus a margin of 6% p.a. and the total outstanding principal
amount and accumulated interest were initially agreed to be fully repaid on 20 May 2016. The loan is secured
with first ranking non-possessory pledges in accordance with the Special Pledges Act on the going concerns
of NURTS Bulgaria EAD and NURTS Digital EAD, which includes among other certain real estates and
other assets of the companies. In November 2015 NURTS Bulgaria failed to repay one of the instalments due

The interest income recognised for the nine months ended 30 June 2020 in the separate financial statements
amounts to BGN 94 thousand (BGN 46 thousand for the nine months ended 30 September 2019).

**28. Contingencies**

The Company is a participant in several lawsuits and administrative proceedings. On 4 July 2016, Empreno
Ventures Limited commenced legal proceedings in Bulgaria, challenging the validity of the first supplemental
indenture (as referred in Note 15). Following the review on three instances, the Bulgarian courts finally
dismissed the case on 16 March 2017 and the claim was rejected. On 26 August 2016, LIC Telecommunications
S.à r.l. commenced legal proceedings in Luxembourg that, among other things, challenge the validity of the
first supplemental indenture (as disclosed in Note 15) and claim damages amounting to EUR 62 million. In
2018 and 2019 judgments were rendered by two instance courts in Luxembourg which declared the request of
LIC Telecommunications S.à r.l inadmissible and declined jurisdiction, which entered into force during the
reporting period. BTC considered the legal proceedings in both Bulgaria and Luxembourg as being
unmeritorious and devoid of any proper legal basis.

The transactions for assignment of receivables on cash deposits in Corporate Commercial Bank AD—in
bankruptcy (CCB), were executed in 2014 as per the provisions of the applicable law. One of the assigned
receivables was utilised by NURTS Bulgaria EAD in order to set-off its obligations to CCB under a bond
issued by NURTS Bulgaria EAD in 2013. CCB held 25,723 bonds with a nominal of EUR 1,000 each and in
September 2014 NURTS Bulgaria EAD has set-off the principal in the amount of BGN 50,310 and applicable
interest due to CCB in the amount of BGN 1,350 thousand against its own cash held in CCB accounts and
assigned CCB cash receivables from third parties, including BTC. Despite of the validly executed transactions,
the receivers of CCB have recognized only partially the set-off from NURTS Bulgaria EAD (BGN
1,543 thousand) where the remaining amount of BGN 50,117 thousand and other owned cash in CCB of
BGN 116 thousand is included in the list of accepted receivables of CCB creditors. No financial assets or
liabilities in relation to this matter were recognized in these financial statements. On 2 May 2017 NURTS
Bulgaria EAD was notified for commencement by CCB of legal proceedings for the challenge of the set-off.

On 14 May 2018 the first instance court cast a decision, as a result of which the NURTS set-offs against CCB
were declared partially null and void and partially invalid vis-à-vis the creditors of CCB. The decision has not
entered into force and has been appealed before the Sofia Court of Appeal.

On 12 December 2019 CCB has withdrawn its claim against NURTS and on 20 December 2019 has initiated
a procedure for the sale of the bonds held by CCB within which the above-referred issues between CCB and
NURTS were finally resolved during the reporting period. Accordingly a provision was recognized by NURTS
in 2019. As a consequence, the bonds and NURTS respectively were deregistered from the public register for
issuers of securities maintained by the Bulgarian Financial Supervision Commission.

After the reporting period Nurts Bulgaria AD was served with documents relating to a case that has been
filed by the administrators of CCB against NURTS Bulgaria EAD claiming the return of certain assets
originating from CCB. As the purported limitation period for filing such claims has expired and NURTS
Bulgaria EAD has already settled all CCB claims, management believes that any chance of transfer of benefits
with regards to this case to be remote and no provision has been recognised in these financial statements.

Based on the information available, management is satisfied that there is no unprovided liability arising from
these lawsuits and administrative proceedings, however there are inherent uncertainties related to the outcome
of the cases. The recognised provisions for lawsuits are further disclosed in Note 14.

**28. Contingencies (continued)**

The Group has bank guarantees issued to third parties which amount to BGN 9,615 thousand as of
30 September 2020 (31 December 2019: BGN 2,738 thousand).

NURTS Bulgaria EAD was notified by CCB that pursuant to a contract concluded on January 16, 2013 the
Company has stepped in as co-debtor in third party’s obligation in the amount of EUR 12,300 thousand. The
management of the company is in a process of confirmation of the relevant circumstances, whereas as per the
date of the present financial statements no reliable and indisputable evidences were received for the existence
of such contingent liability, nor for its exact amount (if such liability exists). Respectively, no liability or
provision has been recognized as at December 31, 2019, and contingent liability was disclosed. During the
reporting period NURTS Bulgaria EAD has acquired the above referred third party’s obligations towards
CCB and thus, any contingent liability is deemed unenforceable and extinguished.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED AND SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**For the year ended 31 December 2020**

**All amounts are in thousand BGN, unless otherwise stated**

**1.** **General information (continued)**

In 2020 the following secondary legislation acts were modified:

- General requirements for the provision of public electronic communications;

- Technical requirements for the operation of terrestrial networks that allow provision of electronic
communications services;

- Technical requirements for the operation of electronic communications networks and the corresponding
radio broadcasting equipment;

- Technical requirements for the operation of electronic communications networks of fixed-satellite and
mobile-satellite radio services and the corresponding equipment.

In March 2018 new legislation involving changes in networks deployment requirements entered into force.
The new Law on Electronic Communications Network and Physical Infrastructure (LECNPI) lightens the
laying of new cables in the existing duct networks, including in networks of other operators, encouraging the
sharing of infrastructure.

During 2019 CRC decided to deregulated access to ducts provided by BTC after a transitional period of 1
year as from the publications of the General Terms and conditions according to LECNPI. The General terms
and conditions were published on 2nd June 2020 and shall enter into force on 2nd June 2021.

At the end of 2020 the EU adopted a Delegate regulation setting single maximum Union-wide voice
termination rates. The latter is expected to be promulgated at the beginning of Q2 2021. The single maximum
rates will apply from the beginning of H2 2021.

**Licenses**

- Fixed line communications

On 28 January 2005 the CRC re-issued BTC’s license for usage and development of telecommunications
network on the territory of Bulgaria and rendering of telecommunication services through the network. Later,
the term of the license was extended until June 2024.

An annual license fee, calculated on the base of the annual revenue from telecommunication services billed to
subscribers is payable quarterly in arrears. During 2020 and 2019 the annual fee is 0.2% of nominal annual
revenue from provision of electronic communications networks and/or services without VAT included and
after deduction of transferring payments to other companies for interconnection of networks and access,
transit, roaming, value added services, as well as expenses for settling copyrights and related rights for radio
and television programs.

An annual fee is to be paid to the CRC for access to limited frequency resources such as the radio-frequency
spectrum. This fee is calculated on the basis of technical data and is payable quarterly in arrears. During 2020
and 2019 the fee was BGN 3,082 thousand and BGN 3,133 thousand, respectively. The fees are regulated by
the CRC and relevant Council of Ministers Ordinances.

- Mobile telecommunications

In June 2004 the Communications Regulation Commission (CRC) granted BTC the license for building,
exploitation and maintenance of a cellular mobile telecommunications network under the GSM standard
with national coverage. The issued license is valid for the period of 20 years and granted the right of using
radio frequency 900 and 1 800 MHz. BTC paid BGN 54,160 thousand for the GSM license.

In April 2005 CRC granted BTC EAD the license for building cellular mobile telecommunication network
under the UMTS standard with national coverage. The issued license is valid for 20 years and gives the right
to use the following radio frequencies:

- 1930−1935 MHZ (total of 5 MHz) for the territory of Bulgaria for transmitting from end mobile devices to
base stations;

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED AND SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**For the year ended 31 December 2020**

**All amounts are in thousand BGN, unless otherwise stated**

**1.** **General information (continued)**

- 2120−2125 MHz (total of 5 MHz) for the territory of Bulgaria for transmitting from base stations to end
mobile devices; and

- 2015−2020 MHz (total of 5 MHz) for the territory of Bulgaria.

In 2012 CRC granted BTC AD an additional spectrum of 5 MHz and exchanged the position of previously
submitted spectrum. According to the amendment BTC had the right to use the following spectrum:

- 1945−1955 MHZ (total of 10 MHz) for the territory of Bulgaria for transmitting from end mobile devices
to base stations;

- 2135−2145 MHz (total of 10 MHz) for the territory of Bulgaria for transmitting from base stations to end
mobile devices; and

- 2015−2020 MHz (total of 5 MHz) for the territory of Bulgaria.

At the end of July, 2015 BTC’s permission was amended again after replacing the assigned frequency bands
and providing additional spectrum BTC was granted the right to use the following spectrum:

- 1965−1980 MHz (total of 15 MHz)

- 2155−2170 MHz (total of 15 MHz)

In Q22016 CRC assigned to BTC additional spectrum of 2x5 MHz in 1800 MHz. Following the procedure of
reallocation of the assigned frequencies, currently BTC is entitled to use:

- 1740−1755 MHz (total of 15 MHz)

- 1835−1850 MHz (total of 15 MHz)

An annual fee, calculated based on the annual revenue from telecommunication services provided to the
subscribers is paid quarterly. In 2020 and 2019 the annual fee is 0.2% from the annual gross revenue from
providing electronic communication networks and/or services, VAT excluded after subtracting the transfer
payments to other companies for interconnection of networks and access, transit, roaming, value-added
services, as well as costs for authority and related rights for radio and television programmes.

For 2020 and 2019 the fees paid for frequency bands in 900, 1800 and 2100 MHz amounted to
BGN 7,850 thousand and BGN 7,842 thousand respectively.

- TV broadcasting

In 2009 CRC has granted NURTS Digital permission for use of resource from radio frequency spectrum via
two networks for digital terrestrial broadcasting (DVB-T) which is mandatory for the operation of its core
activity. As per decision of the European Court of Justice dated 23 April 2015, the Republic of Bulgaria is
found in breach of certain provisions of European directives in relation to the provision of the digital
terrestrial broadcasting permission, which has to be remedied. NURTS Digital has complied with all statutory
requirements in this regard.

In 2019 BTC was granted a permit for use of individually assigned scarce resource—radio frequency spectrum
via digital terrestrial broadcasting (DVB-T).

As of 1st June 2020, the NURTS Digital permit was terminated and all DVB-T activities were transferred to
BTC. Thus, the abovementioned European Court decision is deemed satisfied.

**2.2. Consolidation**

**Subsidiaries**

A subsidiary is an entity that is directly or indirectly controlled by the Company. The Company controls an
entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the
ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED AND SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**For the year ended 31 December 2020**

**All amounts are in thousand BGN, unless otherwise stated**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Company. They are
de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.

The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Company.
The cost of an acquisition is measured, as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and
liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and
contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the
acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition
over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the
cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is
recognised directly in the profit or loss.

For consolidation purposes, the separate financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries have been
combined on a line-by-line basis by adding together like items of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Inter-company transactions and resulting profits or losses as of 31 December, 2020 and 2019, including
unrealized profits at the year end, have been eliminated in full.

**2.3. Segment Reporting**

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief
operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and
assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Managing Board who makes
strategic decisions.

**2.4. Functional and Presentation Currency**

_Functional and Presentation Currency_

These financial statements are prepared in thousand Bulgarian Levs (BGN), unless otherwise stated, whereas
the Bulgarian Lev has been accepted as presentation currency for the presentation of these financial
statements.

Effective from 1 January 1999, the Bulgarian Lev was fixed to the EUR at a rate BGN 1.95583 = EUR 1.00.
The Bulgarian National Bank (“BNB”) determines the exchange rate of the BGN to the other currencies
using the rate of the EUR to the respective currency, quoted at the international markets.

_Transactions and balances_

Foreign currency transactions are accounted for in BGN at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities, denominated in foreign currency at 31 December, are translated at the closing
exchange rate of BNB as at that date.

The foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from
the translation at period-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies, are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income as “finance income/costs”at the moment
when they arise, except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges. Financial instruments
denominated in foreign currency as at 31 December are reported in these financial statements at the closing
exchange rate of BNB.

Non-monetary reporting items in the statement of financial position, which have been denominated in a
foreign currency on initial recognition, are recorded in the functional currency by applying the historical
exchange rate of BNB at the date of the transaction and are not subsequently revalued at closing exchange
rate.

**2.5. Property, plant and equipment and investment property**

**a) Property, plant and equipment**

**Initial measurement**

Upon their initial acquisition property, plant and equipment are valued at acquisition cost, which comprises
the purchase price, including customs duties and any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to a
suitable condition for its intended use. Directly attributable costs comprise mainly the costs of site preparation,
initial delivery and handling costs, installation costs, professional fees for people related to the project, nonrefundable taxes, etc.

As disclosed in Note 15 a provision for decommissioning costs associated with mobile sites is capitalized in
the cost of the sites at the amount of the present value of the estimated decommissioning costs.

**Subsequent measurement**

The chosen approach for subsequent measurement of property, plant and equipment, is the cost model under
IAS 16, i.e. cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses in value. Land is
an exception to this rule and is revalued at fair value.

Revaluation of land is performed by independent certified appraisers usually every three years. When there is
an indication of material changes in their fair value in shorter intervals, the revaluation may be performed at
shorter intervals.

Increases in the carrying amount arising on revaluation of land are credited to revaluation reserves in
shareholder’s equity. As disclosed in Note 2.8 decreases that offset previous increases of the same asset are
charged against revaluation reserves directly in equity. All other decreases are charged to the profit or loss for
the period as other operating expenses.

**Subsequent costs**

Repair and maintenance costs are recognized as current expenses as incurred. Subsequent expenses incurred
in relation to property, plant and equipment having the nature of replacement of certain components,
significant parts and aggregates or improvements and restructuring, are capitalized in the carrying amount of
the respective asset whereas the residual useful life is reviewed at the capitalisation date. At the same time, the
non-depreciated part of the replaced components is derecognised from the carrying amount of the assets and
is recognised in the current expenses for the period of replacement.

Upon sale or disposal of property, plant and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation is
removed from the accounts.

Gains or losses on sale (disposal) are determined as the difference between the amounts received and the
carrying amount of the asset and are presented net under “Other gains, net”in the statement of comprehensive
income. When revalued assets are sold, the amount of the revaluation reserve is transferred to “Retained
earnings”.

**Depreciation**

Property, plant and equipment are depreciated by using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life
of the asset. Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use. Land is not depreciated. The useful
life of the classes of assets is determined in accordance with their physical wear, the characteristic features of
the equipment, the future intentions for use and the expected obsolescence.

- General support represents mainly administrative buildings, furniture and other IT environment

The useful life, set for any tangible fixed asset, is reviewed at each year-end and in case of any material
deviation from the future expectations of their period of use, the latter is adjusted prospectively.

**b) Investment property**

Investment properties are properties held to earn rentals and/or for capital appreciation (including property
under construction for such purposes). Where the Company uses only insignificant portion of a property it
owns for supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes (utilisation of less than 25% is regarded as
insignificant) the property is presented as an investment property. Investment properties are measured initially
at cost, including transaction costs.

Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are measured at fair value in the consolidated financial
statements, which is also the ultimate parent’s group policy. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair
value of investment properties are included in profit or loss under “Other gains, net” in the period in which
they arise.

The chosen approach for subsequent measurement of investment properties for the Company is the cost
model under IAS 16, i.e. cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses in
value. Investment properties (excluding Land) are depreciated by using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful life which is determined to be 25 years.

An investment property is derecognised upon disposal or when the investment property is permanently
withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits are expected from the disposal. Any gain or loss arising
on derecognition of the property (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the
carrying amount of the asset) is included in profit or loss in the period in which the property is derecognised.

**2.6. Intangible assets and goodwill**

**Software and licenses**

Software and licenses are the main items comprising intangible assets. Intangible assets are measured initially
at cost. Intangible assets are recognized if it is probable that the future economic benefits that are attributable
to the asset will flow to the enterprise and the cost of the asset can be reliably measured. After initial
recognition, intangible assets are measured at cost less accumulated amortization and any impairment losses.
Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the best estimate of their useful lives. The useful
life of licenses is from 5 years to 20 years. The useful life of software is from 2 years to 10 years.

Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software
products controlled by the Group/Company are recognised as intangible assets when the following criteria are
met:

- it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use;

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED AND SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**For the year ended 31 December 2020**

**All amounts are in thousand BGN, unless otherwise stated**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

- management intends to complete the software product and use or sell it;

- there is an ability to use or sell the software product;

- it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits;

- adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the software
product are available; and

- the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured.

**Goodwill**

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net
identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is tested annually for
impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are not
reversed.

Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made
to those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business
combination in which the goodwill arose identified according to operating segment.

BTC considers its operations as comprising four cash generating units—fixed business, mobile business,
collocation business and radio and TV broadcasting business.

**2.7 Investments**

In the separate financial statements investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost of acquisition, less
impairment, if any. The cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the consideration given, the
assets given, equity instruments issued, and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange.

Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. The Company controls an entity when it is exposed to, or
has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns
through its power over the entity.

Under the cost method of accounting the investor recognizes income from the investment only to the extent
that the investor receives distributions from accumulated profits of the investee arising after the date of
acquisition. Distributions received in excess of such profits are regarded as a recovery of investment and are
recognized as a reduction of the cost of the investment.

**2.8. Impairment of non-financial assets**

The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any
indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset’s
recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (CGU)
fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does
not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where
the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and
is written down to its recoverable amount.

Impairment losses are recognised in the profit or loss for the period as other operating expenses, except for
land previously revalued where the revaluation was taken to equity. In this case the impairment is also
recognised in equity up to the amount of any previous revaluation.

An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised
impairment losses of assets may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group/
Company estimates the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s recoverable amount. A previously recognised

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED AND SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**For the year ended 31 December 2020**

**All amounts are in thousand BGN, unless otherwise stated**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s
recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying
amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have
been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Such reversal is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as reduction of other operating expenses
unless the asset is carried at revalued amount, in which case the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase.

**2.9. Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held for sale**

Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to
be recovered principally through a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable. They are stated at
the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell if their carrying amount is to be recovered
principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.

**2.10. Financial instruments**

A financial instrument is any contract that simultaneously gives rise to a financial asset at one entity and a
financial liability or equity instrument at another entity.

The Group’s usual financial instruments are: cash and cash equivalents; trade and other short-term receivables,
incl. from related parties, lease receivables and payables, equity (minority) and debt securities, loans granted;
trade and other payables, bank, bond, and other loans received; derivate instruments.

**Financial assets**

_Initial recognition, classification and measurement_

Upon initial recognition, the Group’s financial assets are classified in three groups, based on their subsequent
measurement: at amortized cost; at fair value through other comprehensive income, and at fair value through
profit or loss.

The Group initially measures financial assets at fair value, and in the case of financial assets not at fair value
through profit and loss, the transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial
asset are added. Exceptions to this rule are trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing
component—they are measured based on the transaction price determined under IFRS 15 and the invoice
issued.

The purchases and sales of financial assets whose conditions require asset delivery within a certain period,
usually pursuant to legislation or the effective practice of the respective market (mostly the Bulgarian one)
(regular way purchases), are recognized using trade date accounting, i.e. on the date when the Company
committed to purchase or sell the asset.

The classification of financial assets upon their initial recognition depends on the characteristics of: a) the
contractual cash flows of the respective financial asset, and b) the Group’s business model for management
thereof. In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortized cost or at fair value through
other comprehensive income, its conditions should give rise to cash flows that are “solely payments of
principal and interest (SPPI)” on the principal amount outstanding. For this purpose, analysis is performed
by means of SPPI test at instrument level.

The Group’s business model for the management of financial assets reflects the way the Group manages its
financial assets to generate cash flows. The business model determines if cash flows are generated by the
collection of contractual cash flows, the sale of financial assets, or both.

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

_Subsequent measurement_

For the purpose of subsequent measurement, the Group’s financial assets are classified in four categories:

- Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments);

- Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income with “recycling” of cumulative gains or
losses (applied for debt instruments);

- Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income without “recycling” of cumulative gains
or losses (equity instruments);

- Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss (applied for debt and equity instruments, as well as
for derivative instruments under certain conditions and transactions).

_Classification groups_

_Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments)_

The Group measures a financial asset at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met:

- the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to
collect contractual cash flows, and

- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments
of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest method. They are
subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss upon asset disposal, modification or
impairment.

The Group’s financial assets at amortised cost may include: cash and cash equivalents at banks, trade
receivables and other receivables, loans to related parties and loans to third parties, corporate bonds
(potentially). They are presented within the following items in the statement of financial position: cash and
cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and investments.

_Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (debt instruments) (based on past experience,_
_for future transactions)_

The Group measures its debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income, when both of
the following conditions have been satisfied:

- the financial asset is held and used within the business model, for the purpose of both collecting contractual
cash flows and selling it; and

- the conditions of the financial asset contract give rise to cash flows on specific dates, which constitute solely
payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.

With respect to debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income, the interest income,
foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment losses, including their reversal, are recognised in profit or
loss and are calculated in the same manner as the one applied for financial assets measured at amortised cost.
The other changes in fair value are recognised through other comprehensive income in fair value reserve.
Upon derecognition, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified (recycled) from
equity to profit or loss.

The Group’s debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income may include: investments in
quoted debt instruments (corporate bonds), which are stated within the “long-term investments” item in the
statement of financial position.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED AND SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**For the year ended 31 December 2020**

**All amounts are in thousand BGN, unless otherwise stated**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

_Financial instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (equity instruments)_

At the time of initial recognition, the Group may make an irrevocable election to account for the equity
investments at fair value through other comprehensive income, but only if they meet the equity definition
under IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation, and are not held for trading. The classification is
determined at the level of individual instruments. The Group usually makes an irrevocable election to classify
into this category minority equity investments, which it holds in the long-term and in relation to its business
interests in these entities. They are presented in the statement of financial position within “investments”. The
minority interest of BTC in Sofia Stock Exchange and Intersputnik (Russia) is classified within these equity
instruments.

Upon derecognition of these assets, gains and losses from remeasurement to fair value, recognised in other
comprehensive income, are not reclassified (recycled) to profit or loss. Dividends are recognised as “finance
income”in profit or loss when the right to receive payment is established, unless the dividend clearly represents
a recovery of part of the cost of an investment—in this case gains are recognised in other comprehensive
income. Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are not subject to
impairment tests.

_Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (based on past experience, for future transactions)_

Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include: financial assets designated upon their initial
recognition as “at fair value through profit or loss”, or financial assets for which a mandatory requirement
exists to be measured at fair value. Derivatives, including individual embedded derivates, are also classified as
held for trading, unless they have been designated as effective hedging instruments.

Irrespective of the criteria for debt instruments which should be classified at amortised cost or at fair value
through other comprehensive income as described above, debt instruments may be designated as “at fair value
through profit or loss”upon their initial recognition, if this would eliminate or reduce a significant accounting
mismatch.

Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are measured in the statement of financial position at fair
value, with net changes in the fair value recognised in profit or loss.

This category includes derivative instruments, as well as equity instruments registered for trade on stock
exchanges, with respect to which the Group has not made an irrevocable election to be accounted for at fair
value through other comprehensive income. Dividends from such equity instruments are also recognised
within “finance income” in profit or loss when the right to receive payment is established.

A derivative embedded in a hybrid contract containing a host that is financial liability or a non-financial item
is separated from the host and accounted for as a separate instrument, if: the economic characteristics and
risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host;
a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a
derivative; and the hybrid contract is not measured at fair value through profit or loss. Embedded derivatives
are measured at fair value, and changes therein are recognised in profit or loss. Remeasurement is only done if
there is either a change in the contractual conditions that materially modifies the cash flows that would
otherwise be required, or if there is reclassification of a financial asset outside the category of fair value
through profit or loss.

A derivative embedded in a hybrid contract whose host is a financial asset is not accounted for separately. The
requirement is the host—financial asset, together with the embedded derivative, to be classified in its entirety
as a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss.

_Derecognition_

A financial asset (or, when applicable, a portion of a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets) is
derecognised from the Group’s statement of financial position, when:


-----

**BULGARIAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY EAD**

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED AND SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**For the year ended 31 December 2020**

**All amounts are in thousand BGN, unless otherwise stated**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

- the rights to cash flows from the asset have expired, or

- the rights to cash flows from the asset have been transferred or the Group has assumed an obligation to pay
in full the cash flows received, without undue delay, to a third party under a transfer agreement, in which:
a) the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards from ownership of the asset; or b) the
Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all risks and rewards from ownership of the asset,
but has transferred control thereon.

When the Group has transferred its right to obtain cash flows from the asset or has concluded a transfer
agreement, it assesses the extent to which it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When the Group
has neither transferred, nor retained substantially all risks and rewards from ownership of the financial assets,
it continues to recognise the asset transferred to the extent of its continuing interest therein. In this case, the
Group also recognises the respective liability. The transferred asset and the related liability are measured on a
basis reflecting the rights and obligations that the Group has retained.

Continuing involvement in the form of a guarantee on the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the
two values: the initial carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the
Group may be required to pay.

_Impairment of financial assets_

The Group recognises an allowance (impairment provision) for expected credit losses for all debt instruments
which are not carried at fair value through profit or loss. Expected credit losses are calculated as the difference
between the contractual cash flows due under the contractual conditions, and all cash flows the Group expects
to receive, discounted at the initial effective interest rate. Expected cash flows also include cash flows from the
sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that constitute an integral part of the contractual
conditions.

_Loans to related and third parties, other significant individual receivables and cash and cash equivalents._
_Financial guarantees_

To calculate the expected credit losses from loans to related and third parties, other significant individual
receivables, incl. cash and cash equivalents at banks, the Group applies the general impairment approach
defined by IFRS 9. Under this approach, the Group applies a 3-stage impairment model based on changes
versus the initial recognition of the credit quality of the financial instrument (asset). The categorization used
by the Group to assess the credit risk related to loans, financial guarantees, and other individual receivables, is
as follows:

**Category** **Description** **Basis for recognition of expected credit losses**

_Performing_ The debtor has a low default risk and no 12-month expected credit losses
_(Stage 1)_ payments past due


_Under-performing_ Payments past due for over 30 days or a
_(Stage 2)_ significant increase in the credit risk
compared to initial recognition


Expected credit losses for the asset’s
lifetime—credit-unimpaired


_Non-performing_ Payments past due for over 90 days or Expected credit losses for the asset’s
_(Stage 3)_ evidence that the asset is credit-impaired lifetime—credit-impaired

_Trade receivables, contract assets, lease and other short-term receivables_

In order to calculate expected credit losses for trade receivables and lease and other short-term receivables the
Group has elected and applies a simplified approach based on an expected credit losses calculation matrix and
does not monitor subsequent changes in their credit risk. In this approach, it recognises an allowance
(impairment provision) based on lifetime expected credit losses at each reporting date. The Group has
developed and applies provisioning matrix(es) based on its historical experience with credit losses, adjusted

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

with expected collection trends and forecast factors specific for the debtors and the economic environment,
for which a correlation has been established with the percentage of credit losses.

In the provisioning matrixes used to calculate expected credit losses from trade receivables, lease and other
receivables, provision rates are based on days past due for groups from different customer segments sharing
similar loss models. For BTC Group, such are: corporate and business customers, residential customers and
“international connectivity” customers.

The Group usually assumes that the date of economic loss from uncollectability occurs 365 days after the first
day of delay. This period is studied and historically assessed. The Group does not have a practice of requesting
collateral for receivables from clients.

Contract assets are considered to have similar risk characteristics as receivables related to devices sold on
instalment under the same contracts and customers. Based on historical data about the behaviour of payment
of invoices issued, contract terminations and forecast factors specific for the debtors and the economic
environment, the Group determines impairment rates corresponding respectively to the outstanding balances
of receivables related to devices sold on instalment (lease receivables) and contract assets for the particular
future periods.

**Financial liabilities**

_Initial recognition, classification and measurement_

Upon their initial recognition, financial liabilities are classified as: financial liabilities at fair value through
profit or loss, including derivatives, or as financial liabilities at amortised cost, such as: loans and borrowings,
trade and other payables, bond loans, lease liabilities.

All financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value, and in the case of loans and borrowings and trade
and other payables, net of direct transaction costs.

The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings, including bank
overdrafts, bond loans (if any), derivative financial instruments and lease liabilities.

_Subsequent measurement_

The subsequent measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification.

_Classification groups_

_Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss_

Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading, and financial
liabilities initially measured at fair value through profit or loss.

Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they have been acquired for the purpose of repeated
purchase in the near future. This category includes derivative financial instruments held by the Group which
have not been designated as hedging instruments in the hedge relations pursuant to the IFRS 9 definition.
Separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading, unless designated as effective hedging
instruments.

Gains and losses from financial liabilities held for trading are recognised in profit or loss under the “finance
income/finance costs” item.

Financial liabilities initially measured at fair value through profit or loss are identified as such at the date of
initial recognition only if the IFRS 9 criteria are met. The Group has not classified any of its financial liabilities
at fair value through profit or loss.

_Financial liabilities at amortised cost_

The general accounting policies for the respective financial liabilities are presented in the notes below.

_Offsetting (netting) of financial instruments_

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position, if
a legally enforceable right exists to offset the recognised amounts and if there is an intention to settle on a net
basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

This requirement results from the concept of the actual economic nature of the Group’s relations with a given
counterparty stating that in the simultaneous presence of these two requirements the expected actual future
cash flow and benefits for the Group is the net flow, i.e. the net amount reflects the Group’s actual right and
obligation resulting from these financial instruments—in all cases to only receive or pay the net amount.

If the two conditions are not simultaneously met, it is assumed that the Group’s rights and obligations with
respect to these offsetting financial instruments are not exhausted in all situations by only the payment or
receipt of the net amount.

The offsetting policy is also related to the measurement, presentation and management of actual credit risk
and the liquidity risk pursuant from these offsetting instruments.

The criteria applied to establish the “current and legally enforceable entitlement to offsetting” are:

- lack of dependence on a future event, i.e. it should not only be applicable upon the occurrence of a future
event;

- the offsetting should be enforceable and legally defendable during (cumulatively):

—the Company’s usual business operations;

—in case of default/delay, and

—in case of insolvency.

The applicability of criteria is measured against the requirements of the Bulgarian legislation and the
contractual relations between the parties. The condition of “presence of current and legally enforceable right
to offsetting”is always and mandatorily assessed together with the second condition—for “mandatory settling
of these instruments on a net basis”.

The Group applies netting with respect to financial assets and liabilities with other domestic and foreign
communications operators.

**Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting**

_Initial recognition and subsequent measurement_

The Group uses derivative financial instruments, such as currency forwards and interest rate swaps and options
respectively to hedge the risks related to change in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. These derivative
financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date of concluding the derivative contract.
Following their initial recognition, derivatives continue to be measured at fair valued. They are carried as
financial assets when the fair value is positive, and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.

For the purpose of hedge accounting, each hedge is classified based on its characteristics as:

- fair value hedges, whereas the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability or of an
unrecognized irrevocable commitment is hedged;


-----

**BULGARIAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY EAD**

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED AND SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**For the year ended 31 December 2020**

**All amounts are in thousand BGN, unless otherwise stated**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

- cash flow hedges, whereas the exposure to variability of cash flows due to a specific risk related to a
recognised asset or liability or to a very probable forecast transaction, or to a currency risk related to an
unrecognized irrevocable commitment;

- hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation.

At the inception of the hedge there is formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship and
the Group ‘s risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge.

The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the
hedged risk, and the methods how the Group assess hedging relation for hedge effectiveness (including analysis
of the sources of ineffectiveness of the hedging and how the hedge ratio has been determined). A hedging
relation meets the requirements for hedge accounting if the three effectiveness requirements listed below have
been satisfied:

- there is an “economic relationship” between the hedged item and the hedging instrument;

- the effect of credit risk does not “dominate the value changes” that result from that economic relationship;

- the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged
item that the entity actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the entity actually uses
to hedge that quantity of hedged item.

Hedges that meet all criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for using the methods described herein
below:

_Fair value hedges_

The change in the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised within the respective item in the statement
of comprehensive income (within profit or loss for the year). The change in the fair value of the hedge position
pursuant from the hedged risk is carried as a portion of the carrying amount of the hedged item and is also
recognised within the respective item in the statement of comprehensive income (within profit or loss for the
year).

In case of fair value hedges of items measured at amortised cost, any adjustment to the carrying amount shall
be amortised through profit or loss for the hedge period remaining to maturity, using the effective interest
method. Amortisation by means of effective interest may commence as soon as adjustments are made and not
later than the point of discontinuing the hedged item’s correlation as a result of fair value changes pursuant
from the hedged risk.

If the hedged item is derecognised, the unamortized fair value is immediately recognised in the statement of
comprehensive income (within profit or loss for the year).

When an unrecognised firm commitment has been designated as a hedged item, the subsequent cumulative
change in the fair value of the firm commitment pursuant from the hedged risk shall be recognised as asset or
liability by accounting for the respective gains or losses in the statement of comprehensive income (within
profit or loss for the year).

The Group has no outstanding transactions classified as fair value hedges.

_Cash flow hedges_

The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective is recognised in
other comprehensive income, respectively in the cash flow hedge reserve, while the hedge ineffectiveness is
immediately recognised in profit or loss. The cash flow hedge reserve is adjusted for reduction in the cumulative
gains or losses of the hedging instrument and the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedged item.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED AND SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**For the year ended 31 December 2020**

**All amounts are in thousand BGN, unless otherwise stated**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

The Group uses currency forwards to hedge its currency risk exposure in forecast transactions and firm
commitments. The ineffective portion of currency contracts is recognised within “finance costs”. Moreover, it
uses interest rate swaps and interest rate cap options.

The Group only designates the spot component of forward contracts as a hedging instrument. The forward
component is recognised either: a) in profit or loss, or b) in other comprehensive income and is accumulated
within a separate component of equity, within cost of hedging reserve”. The choice is made on a hedge by
hedge basis. The accounting treatment of interest rate swaps and interest rate options is analogous, with the
changes in the time value of options recognized only within separate component of equity—“cost of hedging
reserve”.

The amounts that have been accumulated through other comprehensive income in “cash flow hedge reserve”
or “cost of hedging reserve” are accounted for depending on the nature of the underlying hedge transaction.
If the hedged transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial item, the amount
accumulated in equity is transferred from the respective reserve and is included in the initial cost or other
carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability. This is not a reclassification adjustment and hence is not
recognised in other comprehensive income for the period. This is also applicable in the cases where the hedged
forecast transaction for a non-financial asset or non-financial liability subsequently becomes a firm
commitment for which fair value hedge accounting is applied.

For all other cash flow hedges, the amount accumulated through other comprehensive income in “cash flow
hedge reserve”or “cost of hedging reserve”is reclassified into profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment in
the same period during which the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss.

If the Group discontinues hedge accounting for a cash flow hedge, the amount accumulated through other
comprehensive income in the cash flow hedge reserve is not reclassified if the hedged future cash flows are still
expected to occur.

Otherwise, the amount is immediately reclassified to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment. Following
the discontinuance, upon occurrence of the hedged cash flows, any outstanding amount in the reserve
accumulated through other comprehensive income is accounted for depending on the underlying transaction,
as described herein above.

**Financial guarantee contracts**

A financial guarantee contract is a contract that requires the issuer to make certain payments to recover the
holder’s loss incurred when a debtor failed to make payment when due, in accordance with the initial or
amended conditions of a debt instrument.

Financial guarantee contracts are recognised as financial liabilities. They are initially measured at fair value
and subsequently at the higher of:

- the amount determined in accordance with the expected credit losses model, and

- the amount initially recognised less, where appropriate, the cumulative amount of income recognised in
accordance with the principles of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.

The model of expected credit losses determines the expected credit loss (ECL) of the guarantee by taking into
consideration the debtor’s published or forecast credit rating, the term, interest rates and repayment plans,
adjusted for the guarantee’s specific conditions, such as default conditions, limits of liability, collaterals, etc.

The expected loss from financial guarantee contracts is included in “Other operating expenses” in the
statement of comprehensive income.

**2.11. Inventories**

Inventories are principally composed of handsets, network establishment and maintenance materials, valued
at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Materials and supplies are expensed when utilized, using the

weighted-average method. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business,
less estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. BTC sells handsets
separately and in connection with service contracts. As part of the strategy to acquire new customers, it sells
handsets, in connection with certain service contracts, at below their acquisition cost. The loss on the sale of
handsets is recognized at the time of the sale and the cost of the handsets is presented as “Materials and
consumables expenses” in the profit or loss for the period.

**2.12. Trade and other receivables**

Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method, less allowances for impairment.

An allowance for impairment of trade receivables is established for the expected credit losses, calculated as the
difference between the contractual cash flows due under the contractual conditions, and all cash flows the
Company expects to receive, discounted at the initial effective interest rate. Expected cash flows also include
cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that constitute an integral part of the
contractual conditions.

The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the
loss is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income as ‘Net impairment losses on financial and
contract assets’. The resulting carrying amount approximates the present value of estimated future cash flows.
When a trade receivable is uncollectible and the relevant legal grounds are present, it is written off against the
allowance account for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited
in ‘Other revenue’ in the profit or loss for the period.

**2.13. Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, balances of current bank deposits, term deposits with original
maturity up to 3 months and all other amounts that are readily convertible into cash.

**2.14. Share capital**

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are
shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds. Where any BTC Group company purchases BTC’s share
capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs is
deducted from equity attributable to the company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled or reissued.
Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable
incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the BTC
Group equity holders.

**2.15. Trade and other payables**

Payables to suppliers and other current amounts payable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

**2.16. Interest-bearing loans and other borrowings**

All loans and other borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received on the
transaction, netted of the direct costs related to these loans and borrowings. After the initial recognition, the
interest-bearing loans and other borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost by applying the
effective interest rate method.

The amortised cost is calculated by taking into consideration all types of charges, commissions and other
costs, including any discount or premium associated with these loans. Amortisation is recognised in profit or
loss as a “finance costs” in the statement of comprehensive income.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED AND SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**For the year ended 31 December 2020**

**All amounts are in thousand BGN, unless otherwise stated**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group/Company has an unconditional right to defer
settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date. Borrowing costs directly attributable
to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to
get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the respective assets. All other
borrowing costs are expensed in the period they occur.

**2. 17. Current and deferred income taxes**

The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the profit or loss,
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised
in equity.

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted at the reporting date.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable
tax regulation is subject to interpretation. The Group/Company establishes provisions where appropriate on
the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the
tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. However, the deferred
income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other
than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit
or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially
enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised
or the deferred income tax liability is settled.

Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will
be available, against which the temporary differences can be utilised.

Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and
associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the group and
it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

**2.18. Employee benefits**

**Defined contribution plans**

According to the Bulgarian legislation, the Group/Company is obliged to pay contributions to Social Security
Funds. This obligation relates to full-time employees and provides for paying contributions to state pension
fund by the employer and by the employee in the amount of certain percentages determined in the Social
Security Code. These contributions are charged to the profit or loss in the period to which they relate.

**Short-term employee benefits**

Short-term employee benefits in the form of remuneration, bonuses and social payments and benefits (payable
within 12 months after the end of the period when the employees have rendered the service or have met the
required terms and requirements) are recognized as an expense in the statement of comprehensive income in
the period when the service thereon has been rendered or the requirements for their receipt have been met and
as a current liability (less any amounts already paid and deductions due) at their undiscounted amount. The
Group’s/ Company’s obligations for social security and health insurance are recognized as a current expense
and liability at their undiscounted amount together with the relevant benefits and within the period of the
respective income to which they are related.

At each reporting date, the Group/Company measures the expected costs of the accumulating compensated
absences, which amount is expected to be paid as a result of the unused entitlement. The measurement includes

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED AND SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**All amounts are in thousand BGN, unless otherwise stated**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

the estimated expenses on the employee’s remunerations and the statutory social security contributions due by
the employer thereon.

**Retirement benefit obligations**

In accordance with the requirements of the Labour Code, the employer is obliged to pay an indemnity to its
personnel upon coming of age for retirement, which depending on the length of service with the Group/
Company, varies between 2 and 6 gross monthly salaries as at the termination date of the employment. In
their nature, these are defined benefit plans.

The calculation of the amount of these retirement benefit obligations necessitates the participation of
qualified actuaries in order to determine their present value at the date of the financial statements, which is
included in the statement of financial position, and respectively, the change in their value, which is included in
the statement of comprehensive income. For this purpose, they apply the Projected Unit Credit Method.

Remeasurements arising from defined benefit plans comprise actuarial gains and losses and are recognised in
other comprehensive income (OCI). Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans
are recognised in profit or loss.

**Termination benefits**

The Group/Company recognises employee benefit obligations on employment termination before the normal
retirement date when it is demonstrably committed, based on announced plan, to terminating the employment
contract with the respective individuals without possibility of withdrawal or in case of formal issuance of
documents for voluntary redundancy. Termination benefits due more than 12 months are discounted and
presented in the statement of financial position at their present value.

**2.19. Provisions for other liabilities and charges**

Provisions are recognized when the Group/Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a
result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle (repay) the
obligation.

Restructuring provisions comprise employee termination payments.

The measurement of provisions is based on the best estimate, made by the management at the reporting date,
concerning the expenses that will be incurred for the settlement of the particular obligation. The estimate is
discounted if the obligation maturity is long-term.

When part of the resources required to settle the obligation is expected to be recovered from a third party, the
Group recognises a receivable if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received, and its amount can
be reliably measured. Income is recognised in the same category of the profit or loss for the period where the
creations of the provision is charged.

**2.20. Revenue recognition**

Revenues comprise all revenues from the ordinary business activities of the Group and the Company, including
not only the core business but also other recurring sales of goods or rendering of services and income from
contractual penalties and default interest. Gains from sales of property, plant and equipment, investment
property or intangible assets are not classified as revenue but presented in other gains, net. Revenues are
recognized net of value-added tax in accordance with the provision of goods or services, if collectability of
the consideration is probable. For service contracts with a continuous service provision, the contractually
agreed total consideration is recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the minimum contract term,
regardless of the payment pattern.

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

A contract asset is recognized if corresponding revenue for fulfilment of a contractual performance obligation
is recorded before the customer has paid consideration or before the requirements for billing and thus the
recognition of a receivable exist. A contract liability is recognized when the customer has paid consideration
or a receivable from the customer is due before the Group or the Company has fulfilled a contractual
performance obligation. On a customer contract level, contract liabilities are set off against contract assets.

Multiple-element arrangements involving the delivery or provision of multiple products or services are
separated into distinct performance obligations, each with its own separate revenue contribution that is
recognized as revenue on fulfilment of the obligation to the customer. This is particularly applicable for sale
or lease of a mobile handset or other telecom equipment combined with the conclusion of a mobile or fixed
telecommunication service contract. The total transaction price of the contract is allocated among the
individual performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices. The stand-alone selling
prices are determined based on the list prices at which the Group sells the telecommunication services and
equipment. For items that are not sold separately, like options providing material right, the Group estimates
stand-alone selling prices reflecting the likelihood that the option will be exercised. As a result, the revenue to
be recognized for the telecom equipment usually delivered at contract inception and sold at a discounted price
in combination with a term service contract is higher than the amount billed. This leads to the recognition of
a contract asset in the statement of financial position. The contract asset is reversed and reduced over the
remaining minimum contract period, lowering revenue from the other performance obligations in the contract
(the telecommunication service). In contrast to the amounts billed, this results in higher revenue from the sale
of goods and merchandise and lower revenue from the provision of services.

One-time payments by the customer that do not constitute consideration for a separate performance
obligation are classified as contract liabilities and are deferred and recognized as revenue over the minimum
contract term. This is applicable to fees for installation and set-up activities that do not have an independent
value for the customer.

Options provided in the contract to the customer to purchase additional goods or services free of charge or at
a discount are separate performance obligations (material rights) for which part of the revenue is deferred as
a contract liability until the option is exercised or expires. Offers for the purchase of additional products or
services at their stand-alone prices are treated as marketing offers and are excluded when determining
consideration.

Long-term customer receivables arising from sales of telecom equipment on instalments, contract assets
arising from sales of a telecom equipment at discount in connection with the conclusion of a term customer
contract or contract liabilities arising from a prepayment by the customer are recognized at present value if
the financing component is significant in relation to the total contract value, including those performance
obligations that do not contain a financing component.

Payments to customers, including subsequent discounts are recognized as a reduction in revenue unless the
payment constitutes consideration for a distinct good or service acquired from the customer, for which the
fair value can be reasonably estimated.

The incremental costs of obtaining a contract (mainly sales commission paid to employees and third-party
retailers) and the costs to fulfil a contract are capitalized if it can be assumed that the costs will be compensated
by future revenue from the contract. Incremental costs of obtaining a contract are additional costs that would
have not been incurred had the contract not been concluded. Costs to fulfil a contract are costs relating
directly to a contract that are incurred after contract inception and serve the purpose of fulfilling the contract
but are incurred prior to fulfilment and cannot be capitalized under any other standard.

The capitalized contract costs are presented as other assets in the statement of financial position and
recognised in the profit or loss as: 1) depreciation and amortization on a straight-line basis over the minimum
enforceable contract period, or 2) other operating expenses when impairment loss is recognized, if their
carrying amount exceeds the remaining amount of consideration that the Group expects to receive, less the
costs that relate directly to providing the goods or services that have not been recognized as expenses.

Principal activities from which the revenues are generated include provision of mobile and fixed voice and
data services, broadband internet access, pay TV services (DTH and IPTV), rent of terrestrial network (ducts),
TV and radio broadcasting, collocation services, connection and roaming fees billed to other operators, and
sales or lease of mobile handsets, other telecommunications equipment, and accessories. Services revenue is
recognized upon rendering of the agreed service. Services are usually billed and paid for on a monthly basis.
Revenue from non-sales-type rentals and leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Revenue and expenses associated with the sale of telecommunications equipment and accessories are
recognized when the products are delivered, provided there are no unfulfilled Group’s/Company’s obligations
that affect the customer’s final acceptance of the arrangement. For telecommunications equipment sold
separately, customers pay in full at the point of sale. For devices sold on instalments in combination with a
term service contract, customers usually pay monthly in equal instalments over a period of 12 or 24 months.

**2.21. Expenses recognition**

Operating expenses are recognized as they are incurred, following the accrual and matching concepts.

Financial costs are recorded in the profit or loss for the period when incurred and comprise of: interest expense,
using the effective interest method, including bank charges and other direct expenses on loans and bank
guarantees, and exchange differences on loans denominated in foreign currency (net).

**2.22. Leases**

**The Group as lessee**

The Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease, at inception of a contract. The Group recognises
a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lease agreements in which it is the
lessee, except for leases of low value assets. For these leases, the Group recognises the lease payments as an
operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease unless another systematic basis is more
representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the
commencement date, discounted by using the rate implicit in the lease. If this rate cannot be readily
determined, which is generally the case for leases in the Group, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used,
being the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of
similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and
conditions.

To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Group uses a build-up approach that starts with a risk-free
interest rate adjusted for credit risk for the country and the Company and makes adjustments specific to the
lease, e.g. term, currency and security.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise:

- fixed lease payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives;

- variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the
commencement date;

- the amount expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;

- the exercise price of purchase options, if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the options; and

- payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the exercise of an option to
terminate the lease.

The lease liability is presented as Borrowings and lease liabilities in the consolidated and separate statement of
financial position.

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

The lease liability is subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease
liability (using the effective interest method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments
made.

The Group remeasures the lease liability (and makes a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use
asset) whenever:

- the lease term has changed or there is a change in the assessment of exercise of a purchase option, in which
case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate.

- the lease payments change due to changes in an index or rate or a change in expected payment under a
guaranteed residual value, in which cases the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease
payments using the initial discount rate (unless the lease payments change is due to a change in a floating
interest rate, in which case a revised discount rate is used).

- a lease contract is modified, and the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, in which
case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate.

The right-of-use assets comprise the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, lease payments
made at or before the commencement day and any initial direct costs. They are subsequently measured at cost
less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the shorter period of lease term and useful life of the underlying
asset. If a lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that
the Group expects to exercise a purchase option, the related right-of-use asset is depreciated over the useful
life of the underlying asset. The depreciation starts at the commencement date of the lease.

The right-of-use assets are presented as a separate line in the consolidated and separate statement of financial
position.

The Group applies IAS 36 Impairment of Assets to determine whether a right-of-use asset is impaired and
accounts for any identified impairment loss as described in Note 2.8.

Variable rents that do not depend on an index or rate are not included in the measurement of the lease liability
and the right-of-use asset. The related payments are recognised as an expense in the period in which the event
or condition that triggers those payments occurs and are included in Other operating expenses in the statement
of comprehensive income.

The Group applies the practical expedient permitted by IFRS 16 not to separate non-lease components, and
instead account for any lease and associated non-lease components as a single arrangement.

Payments associated with short-term leases of equipment and leases of low-value assets are recognised on a
straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months
or less without a purchase option. Low-value assets comprise small items of office equipment.

**The Group as lessor**

Leases for which the Group is a lessor are classified as finance or operating leases. Whenever the terms of the
lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a
finance lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for the head lease and the sublease as two separate
contracts. The sublease is classified as a finance or operating lease by reference to the right-of-use asset arising
from the head lease.

Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recognised as receivables at the amount of the Group’s net
investment in the leases. Finance lease income is allocated to reporting periods so as to reflect a constant
periodic rate of return on the Group’s net investment outstanding in respect of the leases.

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.

When a contract includes lease and non-lease components, the Group applies IFRS 15 to allocate the
consideration under the contract to each component.

**2.23. Dividends Distribution**

Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholder is recognised as a liability in the Company’s financial
statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholder/Sole owner.

**3.** **Financial risk management**

**3.1. Financial risk factors**

In the ordinary course of business, the Group/Company can be exposed to a variety of financial risks the
most important of which are market risk that includes currency risk and interest risk, credit risk, and liquidity
risk. The financial risks are currently identified, measured and monitored by the Treasury Department and
the Managing Directors of each company within the Group through various control mechanisms in order to
establish adequate prices for the services, provided by the company, to appropriately assess the market
circumstances related to its investments and the forms for maintenance of free liquid funds through preventing
undue concentration of a particular risk.

Below are presented the various types of risks to which the companies of the Group are exposed upon
performing their business activities as well as the adopted approach for managing these risks.

**a)** **Credit risk**

Credit risks or the risk of counterparties defaulting, is controlled by the application of limits and monitoring
procedures. The Group has a policy of obtaining collateral from its retail customers who use mobile services
and from distributors. Credit risk is managed at a BTC Group level. It arises from cash and cash equivalents,
derivative financial instruments and deposits at banks, as well as from credit exposures to business and
households, including overdue receivables and commitments. The carrying amount of financial assets
represents the maximum credit exposure.

**Deposits at banks**

According to Treasury policy, applicable to BTC and its subsidiaries, transactions are carried out
predominantly with reputable financial institutions. Credit exposure is controlled by individual credit limits
of counterparties, which are regularly revised and appropriately approved. The limit for each third party is
determined according to its size in terms of assets and equity as well as its long-term credit rating from S&P,
Moody’s or Fitch. The Treasury policy also defines the financial instruments, allowed to the Treasury
Department, as well as the maximum maturity.

**Receivables and commitments**

Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, distributed by industries. The fixed business of BTC
follows the approved by CRC “General Rules of Contracts between BTC and Subscribers”. The management
of risk of non-payment of retail customers is carried out through a policy of suspension and termination of
services, based on credit risk segmentation. The retail subscribers’ contracts termination follows the General
Conditions.

BTC has adopted a policy for mutual connection with telecom operators and wholesale with partners with
good credit ratings by applying of respective guarantees for risk management.

**3.** **Financial risk management (continued)**

The credit risk related to international accounts is managed through the availability of net arrangement
between the contractual parties and by directing traffic through chosen routes in order to decrease existing
exposures. The management is satisfied with the level of risk concentration in receivables as disclosed in
Note 6.

The credit worthiness of the customers is evaluated according to their financial status, payment history and
other factors. On the basis of the credit score individual credit limits are set in compliance with the credit
policy. The levels of the credit limits and their daily observation are monitored. Most of the payments from
customers of mobile services are in cash.

As a result of the assigned receivables on cash deposits in CCB in 2014 and the subsequent cancellation of
transactions as disclosed in Note 6 below the Group has recognized loans and other receivables representing
the majority of the balance of “Other receivables” as of 31 December 2020 and 2019, which amounts to
respectively BGN 22,827 and BGN 33,326 thousand. The receivables are due by several counterparties, one
economic group of which represents more than 50% of the total balance. As at the reporting date all of these
outstanding loan receivables are impaired in full. Apart from this and the disclosed in Note 6, BTC Group is
not exposed to credit risk from an individual partner or group of partners with similar profile. Trade relations
with related parties are similar to those with third parties.

**b)** **Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk arises from the mismatch of the contractual maturity of monetary assets and liabilities and the
possibility that trade debtors may not be able to settle obligations to the Company/Group within the normal
terms of trade. To manage such risk, the Parent company uses planning techniques, including but not limited
to, arrangement of revolving and/or overdraft facilities, daily liquidity reports, and short and medium-term
cash forecasts.

_Maturity analysis_

The table below presents the financial liabilities of the Group/Company, grouped by remaining term to
maturity, determined against the contractual maturity at the reporting date. The table is prepared on the basis
of contracted undiscounted cash flows and the earliest date on which the liability becomes due for payment.
The amounts include principal and interest.

For 2020 the financial liabilities are as follows:

**c)** **Market risk**

**Currency risk**

The main objective of Group’s/Company’s currency risk management is to minimize any adverse effects of
market volatility on exchange rates so as to provide the maximum value of foreign currency net income and
under pre-determined and approved risk level.

Since the companies within BTC Group use mainly BGN and EUR as operating currencies they are not
significantly exposed to currency risk. Most of the income is generated in BGN while long term and revolving
financing, interest payments and part of the capital expenses are in EUR. This mismatch has not been a
problem for the past years as the Bulgarian lev is pegged to the euro. At the same time the stability of the
currency board needs to be monitored closely since a potential free floating of the local currency and
devaluation of the BGN will significantly affect the financial situation of the Group.

Due to forecasted purchases of equipment, satellite capacity and rights for tv providers the Group/Company
identified currency risk, arising as a result of certain exposure to the USD. According to the Treasury policy
of the Group/Company and in compliance with its foreign exchange risk management strategy, the foreign
exchange risk arising from these highly probable forecasted purchases may be hedged. The hedges are cash
flow hedges and are classified as financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.

When significant foreign currency exposure arises, the Group/Company takes into account the following
factors:

- Future outlook on volatility of financial market variables. These are modelled by Treasury and in
accordance with best practice analytical techniques and economic models

- effect of the given foreign exchange exposure on total Group/Company financial results

- cost of foreign exchange exposure hedging

BTC’s Treasury department mainly uses forward contracts to hedge foreign exchange risk. All derivatives are
entered into with credible counterparties and in compliance with the Treasury policy of the Group.

**3.** **Financial risk management (continued)**

**Interest rate risk**

During 2020 and 2019 due to the European Central Bank policy the interest rates were generally negative and
thus the Group/Company was paying only the applicable margin on its bank loans. As of 31 December 2020
there were no liabilities of BTC sensitive to interest rates (2019 : liabilities of BTC sensitive to interest rates
amount to BGN 645,082 and the interest payments are principally based on EURIBOR). In 2018 the
Company decided to conclude two forward starting hedge deals (interest rate swap and interest rate option)
on the interest rate of the Senior Facilities Agreement. 70% of the initial principal amount of Term Loan A
was hedged for the period from April 2020 to April 2023. 88% of the outstanding principal of Term Loan B
was hedged for the period from April 2020 to April 2023. On 31 July 2020 the interest rate swap was terminated
and settled together with the refinancing of the Senior Facilities Agreement, as disclosed in Note 16.

If the variable components of the interest rate on non-fixed interest rate borrowings were 1% higher, that
would have resulted in an increase of interest expenses for 2020 by BGN 2,510 thousand (2019: increase by
BGN 4,708 thousand) therefore, the consolidated profit after taxation would have been
BGN 121,006 thousand (2019: BGN 133,463 thousand). If the variable components of the interest rate on
non-fixed interest rate borrowings were 1% lower, that would have not resulted in a change of interest expenses
and consolidated profit after tax for 2020 and 2019.

**3.2. Capital risk management**

The Group manages its equity in order to perform its activity as a going concern and to balance the return on
equity of shareholders by optimizing the debt to equity ratio in the medium term. The equity structure of the
Group/Company consists of long-term borrowings and lease liabilities (Note 16), cash and cash equivalents
(Note 5) and equity, including share capital, retained earnings and reserves.

In accordance with the Bulgarian Commercial Act as a joint-stock company BTC is required to maintain
equity at an amount which is higher than its registered share capital and legal reserves at an amount of
minimum 10% of the registered share capital. As at 31 December 2020, the Company’s equity is in excess of its
registered share capital by BGN 237,070 thousand (31 December 2019: BGN 369,373 thousand).

Group’s management reviews its equity structure on an annual basis. The gearing ratios as of 31
December 2020 and 2019 are as follows:

**Consolidated financial** **Separate financial**
**statements** **statements**

keep the ratio below 300%.

**4.** **Critical accounting estimates and judgments**

The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates could
differ from the related actual results. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on

historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances.

The estimates and assumptions that might have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next year are discussed below:

**a)** **Impairment of goodwill, tangible and intangible assets**

The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the accounting
policy stated in note 2.6. The ability of a tangible and intangible asset to generate sufficient future economic
benefits to recover its carrying amount is usually subject to greater uncertainty. In performing these
assessments of recoverable amount, a significant number of estimates and judgments are required including
but not limited to:

- An estimate of future cash flows expected to derive from these assets,

- Expectations about possible variations in the amount or timing of those future cash flows,

- The designation of the cash generating unit for which future cash flows are derived. The cash
generating units identified for the Group are: fixed business, mobile business, collocation business and
radio and TV broadcasting business

- The time value of money represented by weighted average cost of capital (WACC).

- Perpetual growth rate (PGR).

For the last couple of years prior to 2018, the Group has been conducting annual impairment testing of its
assets and no need for impairment has been identified. Taking into account the above and the fact that the
Group performed in line with its projections and based on the assessment that no internal or external
indicators existed affecting the recoverable amount of the assets or triggering the need for annual impairment
test of assets, the Management considered that the carrying amount of the assets as of 31 December 2019 did
not exceed their recoverable amount.

Taking into account the outburst of COVID-19 (Coronavirus) pandemic (Note 4 k) the Group performed
impairment testing of its assets as at 31 December 2020 and as a result no need for impairment was identified.
The respective long term pre-tax WAAC rates and PGR values used for the particular cash generating units
(CGU) are summarized below.

**CGU** **WAAC** **PGR**

Mobile business . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7.2% 0.5%

Fixed business . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6.3% 1%

Collocation and radio broadcasting business . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7.3% 0%

TV broadcasting business . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7.6% 0%

If estimated cash flows were 10% lower or WACC/PGR were 1%/0.5% higher/lower there would still be no
need for impairment. These sensitivities are calculated on an individual basis as follows:

**Effect on value in use—**
**Mobile business** **Change (%)** **no impairment**

**b)** **Useful lives of assets**

The determination of the useful lives of assets is based on historical experience with similar assets as well as
any anticipated technological development and changes in broad economic or industry factors. The
appropriateness of the estimated useful lives is reviewed annually, or whenever there is an indication of
significant changes in the underlying assumptions. We believe that the accounting estimate related to the
determination of the useful lives of assets is a critical accounting estimate since it involves assumptions about
technological development in an innovative industry. Further, due to the significant weight of depreciable
assets in our total assets, the impact of any changes in these assumptions could be material to our financial
position, and results of operations.

Were the actual useful lives of the assets to differ by 10% from management’s estimates, the carrying value of
the consolidated plant and equipment and respectively consolidated depreciation and amortization charges
would be estimated BGN 17,176 thousand higher/lower.

**c)** **Provisions, decommissioning costs and contingent liabilities**

Whether a provision or contingent liability is recognized or disclosed in the financial statements is dependent
on a number of assumptions and judgments being made by the management. A provision is recognized when
the Group has a present obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be
required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Contingent liabilities are not recognized because their existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or
non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group.

Contingent liabilities are assessed continually to determine whether an outflow of resource embodying
economic benefits has become probable. If it becomes probable that an outflow of future economic benefits
will be required for an item previously dealt with as a contingent liability, a provision is recognized in the
financial statements for the period in which the change in probability occurs.

Based on detailed assessment, supported by legal opinions, of each of the cases disclosed in Note 28
management concluded that it is highly unlikely an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits to

happen. Accordingly, no liability or provision has been recognized as at December 31, 2020, unless otherwise
disclosed. These issues are expected to be resolved by the competent court after considering all arguments set
out by BTC group companies.

**d)** **Going concern**

The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. In 2020 the Group realized a profit of
BGN 123,265 thousand (2019—profit of BGN 137,748 thousand). The Group’s net current assets as at
31 December 2020 are amounting to BGN 42,352 thousand (as at 31 December 2019:
BGN 294,941 thousand). The future viability of the Group depends upon the business environment as well as
upon the continuing support of the owners and providers of finance. The directors, in light of their assessment
of expected future cash flows and the potential impact as disclosed in Note 4 k) below are satisfied that it is
appropriate for the financial statements to be prepared on a going concern basis.

**e)** **Revenue recognition, contract assets and liabilities**

Multiple-element arrangements involving the delivery or provision of multiple products or services are
assessed to determine whether it is necessary to separate the different identifiable components and apply the
corresponding revenue recognition policy to each element. The transaction price for the entire multipleelement arrangement is allocated among the identified elements based on their respective standalone selling
prices. Determining standalone selling prices for each identified element requires estimates that are complex
due to the nature of the business. A change in estimates of standalone selling prices could affect the allocation
of revenue among the elements and, as a result, the timing of recognition of revenues and the carrying amount
of contract assets and liabilities.

**f)** **Purchase price accounting**

The Group assesses the initial accounting for business combinations by identifying and determining the fair
value to be assigned to the acquired identifiable assets, liabilities, contingent liabilities, and the cost of the
combination. The initial accounting for business combinations is determined provisionally by the end of the
period in which the combination is affected. Either the fair valued to be assigned to the acquired liabilities or
contingent liabilities or the cost of combination can be determined only provisionally. The Group recognizes
any adjustments to those provisional values as a result of concluding the initial accounting within
twelve months of the acquisition date.

**g)** **Allowance for impairment of trade and other receivables, leases, and contract assets**

An allowance for impairment of trade and other receivables is established for estimated losses resulting from
the inability of customers to make due payments. When evaluating the adequacy of an allowance for doubtful
accounts, management bases its estimates on the aging of accounts receivable balances and historical write-off
experience, customer creditworthiness, and estimated probability of default. If the financial condition of
customers were to deteriorate, actual write-offs might be higher than expected.

**h) Income tax provision**

The Group is subject to income taxes in the Bulgarian tax jurisdiction. Significant judgment is required in
determining the provision for income taxes. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax due based on
management estimates. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were
initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in
which such determination is made.

**i)** **Fair value measurement**

Some of the Group’s assets and liabilities are measured and presented and/or only disclosed at fair value for
the purpose of financial reporting. Such are: a) on a recurrent (annual) basis—financial assets at fair value


-----

**BULGARIAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY EAD**

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED AND SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**For the year ended 31 December 2020**

**All amounts are in thousand BGN, unless otherwise stated**

through other comprehensive income, derivative contracts used for hedging at fair value through profit or
loss, investment property, loans granted or borrowings received to/from third or related parties, certain trade
and other receivables and payables, finance lease receivables and payables, etc. and b) on a non-recurrent
(periodic) basis—non-financial assets such as property, plant and equipment.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in a common
transaction between independent market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is an exit price and
is based on the assumption that the sale transaction will take place either in the principal market for this asset
or liability or in the absence of a principal market—in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
Both the designated as a principal market and the most advantageous market are markets to which the Group
must have an access.

Fair value is measured from the perspective of using the assumptions and judgments that potential market
participants would use when pricing the respective asset or liability assuming that market participants act in
their economic best interest.

In measuring the fair value of non-financial assets the starting point is always the assumption what would be
the highest and best use of the particular asset for the market participants.

The Group applies various valuation techniques that would be relevant to the specific features of the respective
conditions and for which it has sufficient available inputs while trying to use at a maximum the publicly
observable information, and respectively, to minimize the use of unobservable information. It uses the three
acceptable approaches—the market approach, the income approach and the cost approach—whereas the
most frequently applied valuation techniques include directly quoted and/or adjusted quoted market prices,
market comparables (analogues) and discounted cash flows, including based on capitalised rental income.

All assets and liabilities that are measured and/or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value, are
categorised within the following fair value hierarchy, namely:

- Level 1—Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

- Level 2—Valuation techniques that use inputs other than directly quoted prices but are observable, either
directly or indirectly, including where the quoted prices are subject to significant adjustments; and

- Level 3—Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement is unobservable.

For assets and liabilities that are recognised at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the
Group determines at the end of each reporting period whether transfers between levels in the fair value
hierarchy are deemed to be made for a particular asset or liability depending on the inputs available and used
at that date.

The Group uses the expertise of external certified valuators to determine the fair value of the following assets
and liabilities: derivative hedge instruments Level 2 and Level 3 investment properties, investments in equity
instruments not quoted on an active market, property, plant and equipment. The choice of such valuators is
made on an annual basis using the following criteria: applied professional standards, professional experience
and knowledge, reputation and market status.

When the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities carried in the statement of financial position
cannot be obtained based on quoted prices on active markets, their fair value is determined by using other
valuation models and techniques, including the discounted cash flows model. The input used in these models
is obtained from observable markets, where possible, but when this cannot be done, significant judgement is
applied to determine fair values. Such judgement involves the review, analysis and assessment of input, for
instance regarding liquidity risk, credit risk, and volatility. The changes in assumptions for these factors may
impact the amount of the fair value of financial instruments

In determining the lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic
incentive to exercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods
after termination options) are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended
(or not terminated).

If there are significant penalties to terminate (or not extend), or any leasehold improvements are expected to
have a significant remaining value, the Group is typically reasonably certain to extend (or not terminate).
Other factors including historical lease durations and the costs and business disruption required to replace the
leased asset are also considered. For lease contracts with indefinite term or short-term technical site rentals
the Group estimates the length of the contract to be equal to the economic useful life of non-current assets
located in the leased property.

The lease term is reassessed if an option is actually exercised (or not exercised) or the Group becomes obliged
to exercise (or not exercise) it. The assessment of reasonable certainty is only revised if a significant event or
a significant change in circumstances occurs, which affects this assessment, and that is within the control of
the lessee.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the
commencement date, discounted by using the rate implicit in the lease. If this rate cannot be readily
determined, which is generally the case for leases in the Group, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used,
being the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of
similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and
conditions.

To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Group uses a build-up approach that starts with a risk-free
interest rate adjusted for credit risk for the country and the Company and makes adjustments specific to the
lease, e.g. term, currency and security.

**k)** **COVID-19 (Coronavirus) epidemic**

As a preventive measure against the outburst of COVID-19 (Coronavirus) in Europe, on 13 March 2020 a
state of emergency was declared in the territory of Bulgaria. All visits in certain commercial establishments
such as restaurants, shopping centres, entertainment and gaming halls, etc. were suspended for two months.
On 23 March 2020 Measures and Actions during a State of Emergency Act was adopted, aimed at mitigating
the negative consequences of the epidemic on citizens and businesses. Subsequently similar extraordinary
epidemic measures were introduced, which with certain variances are still effective since 14 May 2020. While
the core activities of the Group were not directly affected by these measures, certain negative impact on its
financial position and performance during the reporting period could be largely attributed to the COVID-19
related developments. Though no reasonable estimate of the exact financial effect of the coronavirus outbreak
can be made, the impacted items of the profit and loss statement, statement of financial position and
accounting estimates and judgments are presented below.

Net impairment losses on financial and contract assets increased as a result of delays in customer payments
during the second quarter of the year, resulting respectively in higher ECL rates and increase in allowance for
impairment of trade and lease receivables measured by applying the IFRS 9 simplified approach. During the
third quarter of the year the receivables collectability improved and as at the reporting date and the subsequent
periods it is close to pre-coronavirus levels (refer to Note 6).

The coronavirus pandemic had a negative impact on the Mobile services revenue due to lower roaming
revenue, primarily as a result of coronavirus-induced travel restrictions. This was partially offset by decrease
in interconnect and roaming expenses.

Further impact on service revenues are limited by the increased demand for telecom services during the periods
of coronavirus related restrictions.

**4.** **Critical accounting estimates and judgments (continued)**

Potential prolonged recession and a deepening crisis could impact on growth prospects, customer spending
and collection, and may result in assumptions and estimates that could trigger material adjustments to the
carrying value of assets and liabilities in the future. In particular, management expects the assumptions and
estimates used in determining impairment of Trade and other receivables, Contract assets, Property, plant
and equipment, Intangible assets, Right-of-use assets and valuation of Investment property, and the related
Deferred tax assets and liabilities to be affected. Nevertheless, at the date of these financial statements the
Company continues to generate profits and sufficient cash from operations, supporting its activities.

As disclosed in Note 16 BTC secured the payments related to Company’s liabilities under the RCFs and SFA
by establishing a pledge on the receivables under certain bank accounts and insurance policies. As at
31 December 2020 cash and cash equivalents amounting to BGN 19,650 thousand are pledged under the
existing RCF with DSK Bank AD.

On 20.06.2014 the Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) placed one of the servicing banks of the Group—
Corporate Commercial Bank (CCB)—under special supervision. On 6 November 2014 BNB Governing
Council announced its decision to revoke CCB’s license for conducting banking activities and to submit
petition to the competent court of law to open bankruptcy proceedings. On these grounds the cash available
in current and deposit accounts at CCB as at 31.12.2019 has been presented as receivables, as disclosed in
note 6.

Money kept in bank deposits can be withdrawn at any time on demand of the Company and is held to meet
short term operational needs.

On 4 May 2015, being a central billing party (CBP) of MECMA 2014 agreement and acting in good faith,
BTC entered into agreement with the members of MECMA in relation to the cash of MECMA blocked in
CCB. As per the agreed terms, all affected MECMA members assigned to BTC their receivables from CCB

50% of the assigned amount in cash. The agreement is full and final settlement of all potential disputes
regarding MECMA’s cash blocked in CCB. As at 31 December 2019 the assigned receivables from CCB are
included in trade receivables.

Trade receivables for the consolidated and for the separate financial statements as of 31 December 2019
include respectively BGN 60,179 thousand and BGN 59,152 thousand representing the remaining cash and

**6.** **Trade and other receivables, and contracts assets (continued)**

The nominal value of the cash accounts at CCB as of 31 December 2019 is respectively BGN 66,089 thousand
and BGN 65,062 thousand for the Group and the Company. Their net book value as of
31 December 2019 amounts to BGN 12,403 thousand and BGN 12,232 thousand for the consolidated and for
the separate financial statements, respectively, and the accumulated impairment is respectively
BGN 47,776 thousand and BGN 46,920 thousand.

During the reporting period part of the receivables of BTC representing cash and cash equivalents at CCB
was utilized by NURTS Bulgaria for the settlement of the issues between CCB and NURTS related to the
set-off of NURTS obligations to CCB under a bond issued by NURTS Bulgaria EAD in 2013, as disclosed in
Note 29. The remaining receivables of BTC and BTC Net representing cash and cash equivalents at CCB were
assigned to InterV Investment S.à r.l. for cash consideration equal to their net book value.

Based on the data disclosed by Bulgarian Deposit Insurance Fund the management has made an assessment
of the collectability of the cash in CCB which was estimated in 2020 to approximate 21% (19% as of
31 December 2019). As a result, impairment related to the receivables representing cash at CCB amounting to
BGN 1,248 thousand for the Group and BGN 1,227 thousand for the Company has been reversed and
included under Net impairment losses on financial and contract assets for 2020.

Part of the non-current trade receivables are due within two years from the end of the reporting period and
relate to sales of mobile phone sets on instalments. The amounts for the Group and BTC related to these sales
are as follows:

The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime
expected loss allowance for the majority of the trade receivables. The expected loss rates are based on the
payment profiles of sales over a period of 24 months before 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019
respectively and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. The historical loss

Incremental costs of obtaining a contract are additional costs that would have not been incurred had the
contract not been concluded. They comprise mainly sales commission paid to employees and third-party
retailers. Costs to fulfil a contract are costs relating directly to a contract that are incurred after contract
inception and serve the purpose of fulfilling the contract but are incurred prior to fulfilment and cannot be
capitalized under any other standard. The capitalized contract costs are recognised in the profit or loss as: 1)
depreciation and amortization on a straight-line basis over the minimum enforceable contract period, or 2)
other operating expenses when impairment loss is recognized, if their carrying amount exceeds the remaining
amount of consideration that the Group expects to receive, less the costs that relate directly to providing the
goods or services that have not been recognized as expenses.

_Valuation technique and significant unobservable inputs_

The valuation technique used is Market comparison—the fair value is based on the market price of properties
with similar location and category. At the date of valuation no active market existed and the market value was
determined based on offers to sell similar plots under the assumption that these are the end prices. The offered
prices have been adjusted with: discount rate ranging from 10% to 15% to reflect the actual reduction in the
offered price, based on the trends of actual transactions; adjustment coefficients, derived on the basis of
characteristics of the respective plots like size, environmental and geomorphologic condition, level of
development and transport accessibility, and improvements of the land. The estimated fair value of the
individual properties would increase/(decrease) had the respective discount rate were lower/(higher) and the
adjustments coefficients were higher/(lower).

**11) Investment property**

As a result of the improvements and modernization of its fixed network during the past years BTC achieved
substantial optimization of the technical areas in its own buildings. The level of usage of each building is
being assessed as at the end of each reporting period. Where the Group uses only part of a property it owns,
utilisation of less than 25% is regarded as immaterial and the property is presented as an investment property.
The movement in Investment property is presented below:

The fair value of the investment properties as at 31 December 2020 in the separate financial statements
amounts to BGN 133,972 thousand (2019: BGN 140,918 thousand) and was determined by external,
independent property valuers, having appropriate recognized professional qualification and experience.

_Valuation technique and significant unobservable inputs_

The valuation technique used is Market comparison—the fair value is based on the market price of properties
with similar location and category. At the date of valuation, no active market existed and the market value
was determined based on the market comparable approach that reflects recent transaction prices for similar
properties. The transactions prices have been adjusted with: market indices to reflect the actual changes in the
offered price, based on the trends of actual transactions; adjustment coefficients, derived on the basis of
characteristics of the respective plots like size, environmental and geomorphologic condition, level of
development and transport accessibility, and improvements of the properties. The estimated fair value of the
individual properties would increase/(decrease) had the respective market indices were higher/(lower) and the
adjustments coefficients were higher/(lower).

As disclosed in Note 16 BTC has signed an agreement to secure payments related to the Parent company’s
liabilities under the SFA by establishing a pledge on real estate properties presented as investment property,
which value as of 31 December 2019 amounted to BGN 13,314 thousand in the consolidated financial
statements and BGN 1,116 thousand in the separate financial statements. As of the reporting date the pledges
were deregistered.

In the separate financial statements, the investments in subsidiaries are measured at cost, less any impairment.

On 8 June 2015 the Company was informed about an attachment over 43% of the shares of the Company in
BTC Net imposed by the Commission for Forfeiture of Illegally Acquired Property. The attachment represents
a preliminary securing measure in relation to a claim of the Commission against the former ultimate owner of
43% stake in BTC Mr. Tzvetan Vassilev and other parties, including BTC and Viva Telecom Bulgaria EOOD.
On 28 July 2020 the attachment over BTC Net shares was lifted.

The changes in values of the investments in equity securities are due to their measurement to fair value.

In November 2013 BTC announced the successful completion of its debut bond offering of EUR 400 million
6[5]∕8 % Senior Secured Notes due 2018 on the Irish Stock Exchange pursuant to Rule 144A / Regulation S (the
“Notes”). The interest on the Notes was payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year,
commencing May 15, 2014. In relation to the admission of the Notes the Company received a credit rating of
B1 by Moody’s and BB- by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services. On 29 March 2018 and 16 May 2018
respectively, Moody’s upgraded the long-term corporate credit rating of the Company to Ba3 and S&P Global
Ratings reconfirmed it as BB- and in November 2019 both agencies placed the corporate credit ratings on
review. On 27 March 2020 S&P Global Ratings downgraded the corporate credit rating to B+ and on 30
September 2020 lowered it to B and withdrew the rating at VIVACOM’s request.

BTC underwent a consent solicitation procedure for a waiver of the existing change of control provisions and
amendment of certain definitions and ratios applicable to the Notes. The procedure was initiated in relation
to the acquisition by VTL of 100% of the shares of InterV Investment S.a.r.l. On 13 June 2016, Vivacom
obtained the necessary consent of 87.43% of bondholders.

The amendments of Notes’ provisions entered into effect upon the execution of the first supplemental
indenture on June 10, 2016 which became operative on 7 September 2016, when all the conditions precedent
in the first supplemental indenture were either satisfied or waived.

Simultaneously with the bond offering BTC concluded EUR 35 million Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) with
Societe Generale Expressbank AD under which the Company may borrow funds for the repayment of its debt
under the amended and restated loan agreement, financing of its working capital purposes and issue of bank
guarantees and letters of credit. The RCF was initially agreed to be available up to 30 November 2016. The
interest on the principal amounts owing by the Company under the RCF is payable monthly and was initially

On 22 December 2017 the Company entered into an up to EUR 365 million Senior Facilities Agreement
(SFA) arranged by Citibank N.A., London Branch and VTB Bank (Deutschland) AG (currently VTB Bank
(Europe) SE). The purpose of the facility was to refinance all amounts due under the Existing HY Bonds,
payment of fees and costs under the facility and capital expenditure in respect of the Company’s investment
and development program. The SFA comprised of a term loan Facility A, term loan Facility B, a Short-term
Facility and a Revolving Facility. The maximum tenor was 5.25 years after the first Utilization under the SFA,
which occurred on 14 April 2018. The interest on the facilities was based on EURIBOR plus a Margin between
1.25 and 3.75 per cent per annum.

The liabilities of the Company under the SFA were guaranteed by BTC Net EOOD (subsidiary) and Viva
Telecom Bulgaria OOD (parent of the Company) and were further secured by: 1) a non-possessory pledge in
accordance with the Special Pledges Act on the going concern of the Company, which included among other
receivables of the Company under certain bank accounts, insurance policies, related parties and customer
receivables, as well as certain tangible and intangible assets (including trademarks), inventory and real estates
of the Company; 2) a non-possessory pledge in accordance with the Special Pledges Act over the going concern
of BTC Net, which included among other assets the receivables of BTC Net under certain bank accounts; 3)
a non-possessory pledge in accordance with the Special Pledges Act over the going concern of Viva Telecom
Bulgaria OOD, which included among other assets the receivables of Viva Telecom Bulgaria EOOD under
certain bank accounts and the shares of the Company; 4) a non-possessory pledge in accordance with the
Special Pledges Act over the shares of the Company; 5) a pledge in accordance with the Agreements on
Financial Collateral Act over the shares of the Company; 6) a non-possessory pledge in accordance with the
Special Pledges Act over the shares of BTC Net and a possessory pledge over the shares of NURTS Bulgaria
EAD.

On 19 April 2018 the Company successfully completed the refinancing of its Notes ahead of their maturity
date and has delisted the Notes from the Official List and from trading on the Main Securities Market of the
Irish Stock Exchange. As of the date of these financial statements the Company has deregistered the relevant
securities under the Notes.

Simultaneously with the SFA the Company extended the maturity of the Existing EUR 35 million Revolving
Credit Facility (RCF) with Societe Generale Expressbank AD to 18 April 2021 and reduced the applicable
Margin to between 1.05 and 1.75 per cent per annum. The Company has established the respective securities
under the extended RCF on a pari passu basis by the same scope and type of security provided by the
Company under the SFA.

On 31 July 2020 United Group Bulgaria EOOD granted related party loan to BTC and with the received
funds BTC successfully prepaid all liabilities under the SFA and the above referred securities under the SFA
were deregistered. The initially borrowed principal amounted to EUR 295,512 thousand. On 31 July 2020
EUR 45,000 thousand were set-off with loan receivables of BTC from Viva Telecom Bulgaria EOOD within
the terms of a three party set-off agreement. The outstanding principal amount of the related party loan is
due in 10 years. The applicable interest is payable quarterly in arrears and is negotiated to be initially equal to
4.65 per cent per annum and following the completion of a third party transfer pricing study—to such per
cent per annum. determined thereunder.

Simultaneously with the repayment of the SFA, BTC also terminated the Revolving Credit Facility which
securities were deregistered.

On 23 December 2020 BTC concluded EUR 50 million Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) with DSK Bank AD
under which the Company may borrow funds for financing of its working capital needs and for refinancing of
its debt. The RCF is agreed to be available up to 23 December 2023. The interest on the principal amounts

Deferred tax assets and liabilities for different taxable entities are not offset as they cannot be settled on a net
basis and it is not expected that the assets will be realised and the liabilities will be settled simultaneously in the
future.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in
the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The deferred tax assets
and liabilities as of 31 December 2020 and 2019 are calculated in these financial statements at 10% tax rate
which is effective as of 1 January 2007.

As of 31 December 2019, the last period audited by the tax authorities for BTC was 2013. During the reporting
period a tax assessment act has been issued for a tax audit, covering the period January 2017−December 2019
in respect of corporate tax, and no tax liabilities have been assessed.

The last period audited by the tax authorities for BTC Net is 2014.

The last period audited by the tax authorities for NURTS Bulgaria and NURTS Digital is 2013.

**18. Retirement benefit obligations**

In compliance with the Labour Code, the Parent company owes compensation at retirement to all the
employees. The compensation of employees with 10 year experience in the Company is 6 gross monthly
salaries; for the employees having less than 10 year experience the compensation is 2 gross monthly salaries.

Currently no assets have been allocated for covering the long-term staff benefits in a separate fund and there
are no legal requirements for the establishment of such.

The present consolidated and separate financial statements include a provision for employee benefits
obligation, which is measured applying the projected unit credit method.

The movement of the liability, recognized in the statement of financial position, is as follows:

Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on actuarial advice in accordance with
published statistics. Mortality assumptions are based on the statistical information, provided by the National
Statistical Institute for the total mortality of the population in Bulgaria for the period 2017−2019.

The calculation of the defined benefit obligation is sensitive to the assumptions set out above. The following
table summarises how the impact of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period would
have increased (decreased) as a result of a change in the respective assumptions by one percent.

amount and accumulated interest were agreed to be fully repaid on 20 May 2016. The loan is secured with first
ranking non-possessory pledges in accordance with the Special Pledges Act on the going concerns of NURTS
Bulgaria EAD and NURTS Digital EAD, which includes among other certain real estates and other assets of
the companies. In November 2015 NURTS Bulgaria failed to repay one of the instalments due to BTC and as
a result the Company has appointed a manager of the going concern of NURTS Digital EAD. The interest
income recognised for the year ended 31 December 2020 in the separate financial statements amounts to
BGN 120 thousand (BGN 61 thousand for the year ended 31 December 2019).

**29. Contingencies**

The Company is a participant in several lawsuits and administrative proceedings.

On 4 July 2016, Empreno Ventures Limited commenced legal proceedings in Bulgaria, challenging the validity
of the first supplemental indenture (as referred in Note 16). Following the review on three instances, the
Bulgarian courts finally dismissed the case on 16 March 2017 and the claim was rejected. On 26 August 2016,
LIC Telecommunications S.à r.l. commenced legal proceedings in Luxembourg that, among other things,
challenge the validity of the first supplemental indenture (as disclosed in Note 16) and claim damages
amounting to EUR 62 million. In 2018 and 2019 judgments were rendered by two instance courts in
Luxembourg which declared the request of LIC Telecommunications S.à r.l inadmissible and declined
jurisdiction, which entered into force during the reporting period.

The transactions for assignment of receivables on cash deposits in Corporate Commercial Bank AD—in
bankruptcy (CCB), were executed in 2014 as per the provisions of the applicable law. One of the assigned
receivables was utilised by NURTS Bulgaria EAD in order to set-off its obligations to CCB under a bond
issued by NURTS Bulgaria EAD in 2013. CCB held 25,723 bonds with a nominal of EUR 1,000 each and in
September 2014 NURTS Bulgaria EAD has set-off the principal in the amount of BGN 50,310 and applicable
interest due to CCB in the amount of BGN 1,350 thousand against its own cash held in CCB accounts and

assigned CCB cash receivables from third parties, including BTC. Despite of the validly executed transactions,
the receivers of CCB have recognized only partially the set-off from NURTS Bulgaria EAD
(BGN 1,543 thousand) where the remaining amount of BGN 50,117 thousand and other owned cash in CCB
of BGN 116 thousand was included in the list of accepted receivables of CCB creditors. No financial assets or
liabilities in relation to this matter were recognized in these financial statements. On 2 May 2017 NURTS
Bulgaria EAD was notified for commencement by CCB of legal proceedings for the challenge of the set-off.

On 14 May 2018 the first instance court cast a decision, as a result of which the NURTS set-offs against CCB
were declared partially null and void and partially invalid vis-à-vis the creditors of CCB. The decision has not
entered into force and has been appealed before the Sofia Court of Appeal.

On 12 December 2019 CCB has withdrawn its claim against NURTS and on 20 December 2019 has initiated
a procedure for the sale of the bonds held by CCB within which the above-referred issues between CCB and
NURTS were finally resolved during the reporting period. Accordingly, a provision was recognized by
NURTS in 2019. As a consequence, the bonds and NURTS respectively were deregistered from the public
register for issuers of securities maintained by the Bulgarian Financial Supervision Commission.

During the reporting period NURTS Bulgaria AD was served with documents relating to a case that has been
filed by the administrators of CCB against NURTS Bulgaria EAD claiming the return of certain assets
originating from CCB. As the purported limitation period for filing such claims has expired and NURTS
Bulgaria EAD has already settled all CCB claims, management believes that any chance of transfer of benefits
with regards to this case to be remote and no provision has been recognised in these financial statements.

NURTS Bulgaria EAD was notified by CCB that pursuant to a contract concluded on January 16, 2013 the
company has stepped in as co-debtor in third party’s obligation in the amount of EUR 12,300 thousand
(BGN 24,057 thousand). The management of the company underwent a process of confirmation of the
relevant circumstances, including it has asked the receivers of CCB for provision of information, and as a
result as per the date of the present financial statements no reliable and indisputable evidences were received
for the existence of such contingent liability, nor for its exact amount (if such liability exists). Respectively, no
liability or provision has been recognized as at December 31, 2019, and contingent liability was disclosed.
During the reporting period NURTS Bulgaria EAD has acquired the above referred third party’s obligations
towards CCB and thus, any contingent liability is deemed unenforceable and extinguished.

Based on the information available, management is satisfied that there is no unprovided liability arising from
these lawsuits and administrative proceedings, however there are inherent uncertainties related to the outcome
of the cases. The recognised provisions for lawsuits are further disclosed in Note 15.

The Group has bank guarantees issued to third parties which amount to BGN 10,412 thousand as of
31 December 2020 (2019: BGN 2,738 thousand).

During the reporting period BTC has provided corporate guarantees (along with other related parties’
guarantees and securities) subject to certain restrictions and limitations to borrowers that are members of the
group of the ultimate parent under the following instruments: EUR 600 million 3.125% senior secured notes
due 2026, EUR 450 million 3.125% floating rate senior secured notes due 2026, EUR 400 million 4% senior
secured notes due 2027 together with up to EUR 150 million additional notes issued by United Group B.V., as
well as under EUR 250 million revolving credit facility concluded between Adria Midco B.V. and other related
parties as borrowers and guarantors and UniCredit Bank AG, London Branch as facility agent to certain
financial institutions.

**1.** **General information (continued)**

- Functional specifications for portability of fixed, mobile and non-geographic numbers.

In March 2018 new legislation involving changes in networks deployment requirements entered into force.
The new Law on Electronic Communications Network and Physical Infrastructure (LECNPI) lightens the
laying of new cables in the existing duct networks, including in networks of other operators, encouraging the
sharing of infrastructure.

During 2019 CRC decided to deregulated access to ducts provided by BTC after a transitional period of 1
year as from the publications of the General Terms and conditions according to LECNPI.

**Licenses**

- Fixed line communications

On 28 January 2005 the CRC re-issued BTC’s license for usage and development of telecommunications
network on the territory of Bulgaria and rendering of telecommunication services through the network. Later,
the term of the license was extended until June 2024.

An annual license fee, calculated on the base of the annual revenue from telecommunication services billed to
subscribers is payable quarterly in arrears. During 2019 and 2018 the annual fee is 0.2% of nominal annual
revenue from provision of electronic communications networks and/or services without VAT included and
after deduction of transferring payments to other companies for interconnection of networks and access,
transit, roaming, value added services, as well as expenses for settling copyrights and related rights for radio
and television programs.

An annual fee is to be paid to the CRC for access to limited frequency resources such as the radio-frequency
spectrum. This fee is calculated on the basis of technical data and is payable quarterly in arrears. During 2019
and 2018 the fee was BGN 3,133 thousand and BGN 2,836 thousand, respectively. The fees are regulated by
the CRC and relevant Council of Ministers Ordinances.

- Mobile telecommunications

In June 2004 the Communications Regulation Commission (CRC) granted BTC the license for building,
exploitation and maintenance of a cellular mobile telecommunications network under the GSM standard
with national coverage. The issued license is valid for the period of 20 years and granted the right of using
radio frequency 900 and 1 800 MHz. BTC paid BGN 54,160 thousand for the GSM license.

In April 2005 CRC granted BTC EAD the license for building cellular mobile telecommunication network
under the UMTS standard with national coverage. The issued license is valid for 20 years and gives the right
to use the following radio frequencies:

- 1930-1935 MHZ (total of 5 MHz) for the territory of Bulgaria for transmitting from end mobile devices to
base stations;

- 2120-2125 MHz (total of 5 MHz) for the territory of Bulgaria for transmitting from base stations to end
mobile devices; and

- 2015-2020 MHz (total of 5 MHz) for the territory of Bulgaria.

In 2012 CRC granted BTC AD an additional spectrum of 5 MHz and exchanged the position of previously
submitted spectrum. According to the amendment BTC had the right to use the following spectrum:

- 1945-1955 MHZ (total of 10 MHz) for the territory of Bulgaria for transmitting from end mobile devices to
base stations;

- 2135-2145 MHz (total of 10 MHz) for the territory of Bulgaria for transmitting from base stations to end
mobile devices; and

- 2015-2020 MHz (total of 5 MHz) for the territory of Bulgaria.

**1.** **General information (continued)**

At the end of July, 2015 BTC’s permission was amended again after replacing the assigned frequency bands
and providing additional spectrum BTC was granted the right to use the following spectrum:

- 1965-1980 MHz (total of 15 MHz)

- 2155-2170 MHz (total of 15 MHz)

In Q22016 CRC assigned to BTC additional spectrum of 2x5 MHz in 1800 MHz. Following the procedure of
reallocation of the assigned frequencies, currently BTC is entitled to use:

- 1740-1755 MHz (total of 15 MHz)

- 1835-1850 MHz (total of 15 MHz)

An annual fee, calculated based on the annual revenue from telecommunication services provided to the
subscribers is paid quarterly. In 2019 and 2018 the annual fee is 0.2% from the annual gross revenue from
providing electronic communication networks and/or services, VAT excluded after subtracting the transfer
payments to other companies for interconnection of networks and access, transit, roaming, value-added
services, as well as costs for authority and related rights for radio and television programmes.

For 2019 and 2018 the fees paid for frequency bands in 900, 1800 and 2100 MHz amounted to BGN
7,842 thousand and BGN 7,833 thousand respectively.

- TV broadcasting

In 2009 CRC has granted NURTS Digital permission for use of resource from radio frequency spectrum via
two networks for digital terrestrial broadcasting (DVB-T) which is mandatory for the operation of its core
activity. As per decision of the European Court of Justice dated 23 April 2015, the Republic of Bulgaria is
found in breach of certain provisions of European directives in relation to the provision of the digital
terrestrial broadcasting permission, which has to be remedied. NURTS Digital has complied with all statutory
requirements in this regard.

In 2019 BTC was granted a permit for use of individually assigned scarce resource—radio frequency spectrum
via digital terrestrial broadcasting (DVB-T).

As of 1st June 2020, the NURTS Digital permit will be terminated and all DVB-T activities will be transferred
to BTC. Thus, the abovementioned European Court decision is deemed satisfied.

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies**

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated and separate financial
statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless
otherwise stated.

**2.1. Basis of preparation**

The consolidated and separate financial statements (“the financial statements”) of BTC have been prepared
in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European
Union (EU).

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified for the
revaluation of land and investment property, certain financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive
income, financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through profit
or loss, and defined benefit plan at the present value of the obligation.

Consolidated financial information, including subsidiaries, has been prepared using uniform accounting
policies for similar transactions and other events in similar circumstances.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED AND SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**For the year ended 31 December 2019**

**All amounts are in thousand BGN, unless otherwise stated**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

The presentation of the financial statements requires management to make the critical accounting estimates,
accruals and assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts
of income and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s
best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results may differ from those estimates (Note 4).

- Initial application of new amendments to the existing standards effective for the current reporting period

The following amendments to the existing standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board
(IASB) and adopted by the EU are effective for the current reporting period:

- IFRS 16 “Leases”—adopted by the EU on October 31, 2017 (effective for annual periods beginning on or
after January 1, 2019),

- Amendments to IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”—Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation—
adopted by the EU on March 22, 2018 (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019),

- Amendments to IAS 19 “Employee Benefits”—Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement—adopted by
the EU on March 13, 2019 (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019),

- Amendments to IAS 28 “Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures”—Long-term Interests in Associates
and Joint Ventures—adopted by the EU on February 8, 2019 (effective for annual periods beginning on or
after January 1, 2019),

- Amendments to various standards due to “Improvements to IFRSs (cycle 2015-2017)” resulting from the
annual improvement project of IFRS (IFRS 3, IFRS 11, IAS 12 and IAS 23) primarily with a view to
removing inconsistencies and clarifying wording—adopted by the EU on March 14, 2019 (effective for
annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019),

- IFRIC 23 “Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments”—adopted by the EU on October 23, 2018 (effective
for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019).

The Group had to change its accounting policy and make certain adjustments following the adoption of
IFRS 16, as disclosed below. The adoption of the other amendments to the existing standards and
interpretation has not led to any material changes in these financial statements.

Under IFRS 16, lessors continue to make distinction between operating lease and finance lease as previously
under IAS 17, while lessees are required to recognize assets and liabilities for principally all leases in the
statement of financial position. Summary of the performed impact assessment is presented below.

The Group has adopted the new standard on the required effective date retrospectively but has not restated
comparatives for the 2018 reporting period, as permitted under the specific transitional provisions in the
standard. The reclassifications and the adjustments arising from the new leasing rules are therefore recognised
in the opening balance sheet on 1 January 2019. On transition to IFRS 16, the Group recognised additional
BGN 258,934 thousand of right of use assets (Note 11) and BGN 259,661 thousand lease liabilities (Note 16)
and the Company—respectively BGN 294,146 thousand and BGN 294,874 thousand. Equity is not impacted
as the right-of-use asset is measured at an amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any
prepaid or accrued lease payments relating to that lease recognized in the statement of financial position
immediately before the date of initial application.

Amortization of the right-of-use assets and interest costs on the lease obligation are recognized in the
statements of comprehensive income instead of operating expense under the previous lease standard.
Classification of lease payments in the statement of cash flows is also affected by the requirements of the new
lease standard: a significant portion of the lease payments recognized as cash flows from operating activities
in the statement of cash flows previously, are classified as cash flows from financing activities upon application
of the new lease accounting requirements. Accounting policy elated to leases is presented in Note 2.22.

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

The Group’s lease portfolio mainly consists of administrative and commercial buildings, fixed and mobile site
rentals, network infrastructure, software and vehicles. Main assumptions applied in determining the values of
the lease liability and right-of-use asset include the assessment of the lease term and the appropriate discount
rate. The lease term is impacted by the assessment of the reasonably certain criterion in respect of renewal or
termination options. For lease contracts with indefinite term or short term technical site rentals the Group
estimates the length of the contract to be equal to the economic useful life of non-current assets located in the
leased property. The same economic useful life is applied to determine the depreciation rate of right-of-use
assets. The Group’s incremental borrowing rate, taking into account the expected term of the leases is applied
for discounting the future payment obligations. As of 1 January 2019 the weighted-average rate is 4.99%. For
significant judgements related to leases, see Note 4 k).

The following options and practical expedients were exercised by the Group on transition to the new
requirements:

- Single discount rate is applied to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics such as lease
term, class of underlying asset and currency.

- Initial direct costs are excluded from the measurement of the right-of use asset at the date of initial
application.

- A distinction is not made in leases that contain both lease components and non-lease components. Each
lease component is accounted for together with other related performance components as a single lease
component.

- The Group has not applied the practical expedient that allows to avoid reassessing whether a contract is, or
contains, a lease at the date of initial application of IFRS 16. Besides the contracts identified as leases
under the previous accounting standard, the new requirements are applied to certain contracts that were
previously treated as supply of service (such as collocation and satellite capacity agreements, where entire
satellite transponder is being rented).

**2.2. Consolidation**

**Subsidiaries**

A subsidiary is an entity that is directly or indirectly controlled by the Company. The Company controls an
entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the
ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.

Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Company. They are
de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.

The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Company.
The cost of an acquisition is measured, as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and
liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and
contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the
acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition
over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the
cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is
recognised directly in the profit or loss.

For consolidation purposes, the separate financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries have been
combined on a line-by-line basis by adding together like items of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Inter-company transactions and resulting profits or losses as of 31 December, 2019 and 2018, including
unrealized profits at the year end, have been eliminated in full.

**2.3. Segment Reporting**

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief
operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and
assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Managing Board who makes
strategic decisions.

**2.4. Functional and Presentation Currency**

_Functional and Presentation Currency_

These financial statements are prepared in thousand Bulgarian Levs (BGN), unless otherwise stated, whereas
the Bulgarian Lev has been accepted as presentation currency for the presentation of these financial
statements.

Effective from 1 January 1999, the Bulgarian Lev was fixed to the EUR at a rate BGN 1.95583 = EUR 1.00.
The Bulgarian National Bank (“BNB”) determines the exchange rate of the BGN to the other currencies
using the rate of the EUR to the respective currency, quoted at the international markets.

_Transactions and balances_

Foreign currency transactions are accounted for in BGN at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities, denominated in foreign currency at 31 December, are translated at the closing
exchange rate of BNB as at that date.

The foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from
the translation at period-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies, are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income as “finance income/costs”at the moment
when they arise, except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges. Financial instruments,
denominated in foreign currency as at 31 December are reported in these financial statements at the closing
exchange rate of BNB.

Non-monetary reporting items in the statement of financial position, which have been denominated in a
foreign currency on initial recognition, are recorded in the functional currency by applying the historical
exchange rate of BNB at the date of the transaction and are not subsequently revalued at closing exchange
rate.

**2.5. Property, plant and equipment and investment property**

**a)** **Property, plant and equipment**

**Initial measurement**

Upon their initial acquisition property, plant and equipment are valued at acquisition cost, which comprises
the purchase price, including customs duties and any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to a
suitable condition for its intended use. Directly attributable costs comprise mainly the costs of site preparation,
initial delivery and handling costs, installation costs, professional fees for people related to the project, nonrefundable taxes, etc.

As disclosed in Note 15 a provision for decommissioning costs associated with mobile sites is capitalized in
the cost of the sites at the amount of the present value of the estimated decommissioning costs.

**Subsequent measurement**

The chosen approach for subsequent measurement of property, plant and equipment, is the cost model under
IAS 16, i.e. cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses in value. Land is
an exception to this rule and is revalued at fair value.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED AND SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**For the year ended 31 December 2019**

**All amounts are in thousand BGN, unless otherwise stated**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

Revaluation of land is performed by independent certified appraisers usually every three years. When there is
an indication of material changes in their fair value in shorter intervals, the revaluation may be performed at
shorter intervals.

Increases in the carrying amount arising on revaluation of land are credited to revaluation reserves in
shareholder’s equity. As disclosed in Note 2.8 decreases that offset previous increases of the same asset are
charged against revaluation reserves directly in equity. All other decreases are charged to the profit or loss for
the period as other operating expenses.

**Subsequent costs**

Repair and maintenance costs are recognized as current expenses as incurred. Subsequent expenses incurred
in relation to property, plant and equipment having the nature of replacement of certain components,
significant parts and aggregates or improvements and restructuring, are capitalized in the carrying amount of
the respective asset whereas the residual useful life is reviewed at the capitalisation date. At the same time, the
non-depreciated part of the replaced components is derecognised from the carrying amount of the assets and
is recognised in the current expenses for the period of replacement.

Upon sale or disposal of property, plant and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation is
removed from the accounts.

Gains or losses on sale (disposal) are determined as the difference between the amounts received and the
carrying amount of the asset and are presented net under “Other gains, net”in the statement of comprehensive
income. When revalued assets are sold, the amount of the revaluation reserve is transferred to “Retained
earnings”.

**Depreciation**

Property, plant and equipment are depreciated by using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life
of the asset. Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use. Land is not depreciated. The useful
life of the classes of assets is determined in accordance with their physical wear, the characteristic features of
the equipment, the future intentions for use and the expected obsolescence.

The estimated useful lives of the major classes of property, plant and equipment are as follows:

**Class** **Useful life**

Switches . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4–12 years

Transmission, distribution and remote switching . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15–25 years

Optic cables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15–25 years

Mobile network . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6–25 years

General support* . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2–25 years

- General support represents mainly administrative buildings, furniture and other IT environment

The useful life, set for any tangible fixed asset, is reviewed at each year-end and in case of any material
deviation from the future expectations of their period of use, the latter is adjusted prospectively.

**b)** **Investment property**

Investment properties are properties held to earn rentals and/or for capital appreciation (including property
under construction for such purposes). Where the Company uses only insignificant portion of a property it
owns for supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes (utilisation of less than 25% is regarded as
insignificant) the property is presented as an investment property. Investment properties are measured initially
at cost, including transaction costs.

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are measured at fair value in the consolidated financial
statements, which is also the ultimate parent’s group policy. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair
value of investment properties are included in profit or loss under “Other gains, net” in the period in which
they arise.

The chosen approach for subsequent measurement of investment properties for the Company is the cost
model under IAS 16, i.e. cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses in
value. Investment properties (excluding Land) are depreciated by using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful life which is determined to be 25 years.

An investment property is derecognised upon disposal or when the investment property is permanently
withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits are expected from the disposal. Any gain or loss arising
on derecognition of the property (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the
carrying amount of the asset) is included in profit or loss in the period in which the property is derecognised.

**2.6. Intangible assets and goodwill**

**Software and licenses**

Software and licenses are the main items comprising intangible assets. Intangible assets are measured initially
at cost. Intangible assets are recognized if it is probable that the future economic benefits that are attributable
to the asset will flow to the enterprise and the cost of the asset can be reliably measured. After initial
recognition, intangible assets are measured at cost less accumulated amortization and any impairment losses.
Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the best estimate of their useful lives. The useful
life of licenses is from 5 years to 20 years. The useful life of software is from 2 years to 10 years.

Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software
products controlled by the Group/Company are recognised as intangible assets when the following criteria are
met:

- it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use;

- management intends to complete the software product and use or sell it;

- there is an ability to use or sell the software product;

- it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits;

- adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the software
product are available; and

- the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured.

**Goodwill**

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net
identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is tested annually for
impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are not
reversed.

Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made
to those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business
combination in which the goodwill arose identified according to operating segment.

BTC considers its operations as comprising four cash generating units—fixed business, mobile business,
collocation business and radio and TV broadcasting business.

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

**2.7 Investments**

In the separate financial statements investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost of acquisition, less
impairment, if any. The cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the consideration given, the
assets given, equity instruments issued, and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange.

Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. The Company controls an entity when it is exposed to, or
has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns
through its power over the entity.

Under the cost method of accounting the investor recognizes income from the investment only to the extent
that the investor receives distributions from accumulated profits of the investee arising after the date of
acquisition. Distributions received in excess of such profits are regarded as a recovery of investment and are
recognized as a reduction of the cost of the investment.

**2.8. Impairment of non-financial assets**

The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any
indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset’s
recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (CGU)
fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does
not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where
the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and
is written down to its recoverable amount.

Impairment losses are recognised in the profit or loss for the period as other operating expenses, except for
land previously revalued where the revaluation was taken to equity. In this case the impairment is also
recognised in equity up to the amount of any previous revaluation.

An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised
impairment losses of assets may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group/
Company estimates the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s recoverable amount. A previously recognised
impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s
recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying
amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have
been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Such reversal is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as reduction of other operating expenses
unless the asset is carried at revalued amount, in which case the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase.

**2.9. Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held for sale**

Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to
be recovered principally through a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable. They are stated at
the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell if their carrying amount is to be recovered
principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.

**2.10. Financial instruments**

A financial instrument is any contract that simultaneously gives rise to a financial asset at one entity and a
financial liability or equity instrument at another entity.

The Group’s usual financial instruments are: cash and cash equivalents; trade and other short-term receivables,
incl. from related parties, lease receivables and payables, equity (minority) and debt securities, loans granted;
trade and other payables, bank, bond, and other loans received; derivate instruments.

**Financial assets**

_Initial recognition, classification and measurement_

Upon initial recognition, the Group’s financial assets are classified in three groups, based on their subsequent
measurement: at amortized cost; at fair value through other comprehensive income, and at fair value through
profit or loss.

The Group initially measures financial assets at fair value, and in the case of financial assets not at fair value
through profit and loss, the transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial
asset are added. Exceptions to this rule are trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing
component—they are measured based on the transaction price determined under IFRS 15 and the invoice
issued.

The purchases and sales of financial assets whose conditions require asset delivery within a certain period,
usually pursuant to legislation or the effective practice of the respective market (mostly the Bulgarian one)
(regular way purchases), are recognized using trade date accounting, i.e. on the date when the Company
committed to purchase or sell the asset.

The classification of financial assets upon their initial recognition depends on the characteristics of: a) the
contractual cash flows of the respective financial asset, and b) the Group’s business model for management
thereof. In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortized cost or at fair value through
other comprehensive income, its conditions should give rise to cash flows that are “solely payments of
principal and interest (SPPI)” on the principal amount outstanding. For this purpose, analysis is performed
by means of SPPI test at instrument level.

The Group’s business model for the management of financial assets reflects the way the Group manages its
financial assets to generate cash flows. The business model determines if cash flows are generated by the
collection of contractual cash flows, the sale of financial assets, or both.

_Subsequent measurement_

For the purpose of subsequent measurement, the Group’s financial assets are classified in four categories:

- Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments);

- Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income with “recycling” of cumulative gains or
losses (applied for debt instruments);

- Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income without “recycling” of cumulative gains
or losses (equity instruments);

- Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss (applied for debt and equity instruments, as well as
for derivative instruments under certain conditions and transactions).

_Classification groups_

_Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments)_

The Group measures a financial asset at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met:

- the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to
collect contractual cash flows, and

- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments
of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED AND SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**For the year ended 31 December 2019**

**All amounts are in thousand BGN, unless otherwise stated**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest method. They are
subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss upon asset disposal, modification or
impairment.

The Group’s financial assets at amortised cost may include: cash and cash equivalents at banks, trade
receivables and other receivables, loans to related parties and loans to third parties, corporate bonds
(potentially). They are presented within the following items in the statement of financial position: cash and
cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and investments.

_Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (debt instruments) (based on past experience,_
_for future transactions)_

The Group measures its debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income, when both of
the following conditions have been satisfied:

- the financial asset is held and used within the business model, for the purpose of both collecting contractual
cash flows and selling it; and

- the conditions of the financial asset contract give rise to cash flows on specific dates, which constitute solely
payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.

With respect to debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income, the interest income,
foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment losses, including their reversal, are recognised in profit or
loss and are calculated in the same manner as the one applied for financial assets measured at amortised cost.
The other changes in fair value are recognised through other comprehensive income in fair value reserve.
Upon derecognition, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified (recycled) from
equity to profit or loss.

The Group’s debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income may include: investments in
quoted debt instruments (corporate bonds), which are stated within the “long-term investments” item in the
statement of financial position.

_Financial instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (equity instruments)_

At the time of initial recognition, the Group may make an irrevocable election to account for the equity
investments at fair value through other comprehensive income, but only if they meet the equity definition
under IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation, and are not held for trading. The classification is
determined at the level of individual instruments. The Group usually makes an irrevocable election to classify
into this category minority equity investments, which it holds in the long-term and in relation to its business
interests in these entities. They are presented in the statement of financial position within “investments”. The
minority interest of BTC in: Viva Telecom Bulgaria, Sofia Stock Exchange and Intersputnik (Russia) is
classified within these equity instruments.

Upon derecognition of these assets, gains and losses from remeasurement to fair value, recognised in other
comprehensive income, are not reclassified (recycled) to profit or loss. Dividends are recognised as “finance
income”in profit or loss when the right to receive payment is established, unless the dividend clearly represents
a recovery of part of the cost of an investment—in this case gains are recognised in other comprehensive
income. Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are not subject to
impairment tests.

_Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (based on past experience, for future transactions)_

Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include: financial assets designated upon their initial
recognition as “at fair value through profit or loss”, or financial assets for which a mandatory requirement
exists to be measured at fair value. Derivatives, including individual embedded derivates, are also classified as
held for trading, unless they have been designated as effective hedging instruments.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED AND SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**For the year ended 31 December 2019**

**All amounts are in thousand BGN, unless otherwise stated**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

Irrespective of the criteria for debt instruments which should be classified at amortised cost or at fair value
through other comprehensive income as described above, debt instruments may be designated as “at fair value
through profit or loss”upon their initial recognition, if this would eliminate or reduce a significant accounting
mismatch.

Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are measured in the statement of financial position at fair
value, with net changes in the fair value recognised in profit or loss.

This category includes derivative instruments, as well as equity instruments registered for trade on stock
exchanges, with respect to which the Group has not made an irrevocable election to be accounted for at fair
value through other comprehensive income. Dividends from such equity instruments are also recognised
within “finance income” in profit or loss when the right to receive payment is established.

A derivative embedded in a hybrid contract containing a host that is financial liability or a non-financial item
is separated from the host and accounted for as a separate instrument, if: the economic characteristics and
risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host;
a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a
derivative; and the hybrid contract is not measured at fair value through profit or loss. Embedded derivatives
are measured at fair value, and changes therein are recognised in profit or loss. Remeasurement is only done if
there is either a change in the contractual conditions that materially modifies the cash flows that would
otherwise be required, or if there is reclassification of a financial asset outside the category of fair value
through profit or loss.

A derivative embedded in a hybrid contract whose host is a financial asset is not accounted for separately. The
requirement is the host—financial asset, together with the embedded derivative, to be classified in its entirety
as a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss.

_Derecognition_

A financial asset (or, when applicable, a portion of a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets) is
derecognised from the Group’s statement of financial position, when:

- the rights to cash flows from the asset have expired, or

- the rights to cash flows from the asset have been transferred or the Group has assumed an obligation to pay
in full the cash flows received, without undue delay, to a third party under a transfer agreement, in which:
a) the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards from ownership of the asset; or b) the
Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all risks and rewards from ownership of the asset,
but has transferred control thereon.

When the Group has transferred its right to obtain cash flows from the asset or has concluded a transfer
agreement, it assesses the extent to which it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When the Group
has neither transferred, nor retained substantially all risks and rewards from ownership of the financial assets,
it continues to recognise the asset transferred to the extent of its continuing interest therein. In this case, the
Group also recognises the respective liability. The transferred asset and the related liability are measured on a
basis reflecting the rights and obligations that the Group has retained.

Continuing involvement in the form of a guarantee on the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the
two values: the initial carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the
Group may be required to pay.

_Impairment of financial assets_

The Group recognises an allowance (impairment provision) for expected credit losses for all debt instruments
which are not carried at fair value through profit or loss. Expected credit losses are calculated as the difference
between the contractual cash flows due under the contractual conditions, and all cash flows the Group expects

to receive, discounted at the initial effective interest rate. Expected cash flows also include cash flows from the
sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that constitute an integral part of the contractual
conditions.

_Loans to related and third parties, other significant individual receivables and cash and cash equivalents._
_Financial guarantees_

To calculate the expected credit losses from loans to related and third parties, other significant individual
receivables, incl. cash and cash equivalents at banks, the Group applies the general impairment approach
defined by IFRS 9. Under this approach, the Group applies a 3-stage impairment model based on changes
versus the initial recognition of the credit quality of the financial instrument (asset). The categorization used
by the Group to assess the credit risk related to loans, financial guarantees, and other individual receivables, is
as follows:

**Category** **Description** **Basis for recognition of expected credit losses**

_Performing_ The debtor has a low default risk and 12-month expected credit losses
_(Stage 1)_ no payments past due


_Under-performing_ Payments past due for over 30 days or
_(Stage 2)_ a significant increase in the credit risk
compared to initial recognition

_Non-performing_ Payments past due for over 90 days or
_(Stage 3)_ evidence that the asset is creditimpaired

_Trade receivables, contract assets, lease and other short-term receivables_


Expected credit losses for the asset’s
lifetime—credit-unimpaired

Expected credit losses for the asset’s
lifetime—credit-impaired


In order to calculate expected credit losses for trade receivables and lease and other short-term receivables the
Group has elected and applies a simplified approach based on an expected credit losses calculation matrix and
does not monitor subsequent changes in their credit risk. In this approach, it recognises an allowance
(impairment provision) based on lifetime expected credit losses at each reporting date. The Group has
developed and applies provisioning matrix(es) based on its historical experience with credit losses, adjusted
with expected collection trends and forecast factors specific for the debtors and the economic environment,
for which a correlation has been established with the percentage of credit losses.

In the provisioning matrixes used to calculate expected credit losses from trade receivables, lease and other
receivables, provision rates are based on days past due for groups from different customer segments sharing
similar loss models. For BTC Group, such are: corporate and business customers, residential customers and
“international connectivity” customers.

The Group usually assumes that the date of economic loss from uncollectability occurs 365 days after the first
day of delay. This period is studied and historically assessed. The Group does not have a practice of requesting
collateral for receivables from clients.

Contract assets are considered to have similar risk characteristics as lease receivables under the same contracts
and customers. Based on historical data about the behaviour of payment of invoices issued and forecast
factors specific for the debtors and the economic environment, the Group determines fixed impairment rates
which are applied respectively to lease receivables and contract assets.

**Financial liabilities**

_Initial recognition, classification and measurement_

Upon their initial recognition, financial liabilities are classified as: financial liabilities at fair value through
profit or loss, including derivatives, or as financial liabilities at amortised cost, such as: loans and borrowings,
trade and other payables, bond loans, lease liabilities.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED AND SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**For the year ended 31 December 2019**

**All amounts are in thousand BGN, unless otherwise stated**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

All financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value, and in the case of loans and borrowings and trade
and other payables, net of direct transaction costs.

The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings, including bank
overdrafts, bond loans (if any), derivative financial instruments and lease liabilities.

_Subsequent measurement_

The subsequent measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification.

_Classification groups_

_Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss_

Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading, and financial
liabilities initially measured at fair value through profit or loss.

Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they have been acquired for the purpose of repeated
purchase in the near future. This category includes derivative financial instruments held by the Group which
have not been designated as hedging instruments in the hedge relations pursuant to the IFRS 9 definition.
Separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading, unless designated as effective hedging
instruments.

Gains and losses from financial liabilities held for trading are recognised in profit or loss under the “finance
income/finance costs” item.

Financial liabilities initially measured at fair value through profit or loss are identified as such at the date of
initial recognition only if the IFRS 9 criteria are met. The Group has not classified any of its financial liabilities
at fair value through profit or loss.

_Financial liabilities at amortised cost_

The general accounting policies for the respective financial liabilities are presented in the notes below.

_Offsetting (netting) of financial instruments_

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position, if
a legally enforceable right exists to offset the recognised amounts and if there is an intention to settle on a net
basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

This requirement results from the concept of the actual economic nature of the Group’s relations with a given
counterparty stating that in the simultaneous presence of these two requirements the expected actual future
cash flow and benefits for the Group is the net flow, i.e. the net amount reflects the Group’s actual right and
obligation resulting from these financial instruments—in all cases to only receive or pay the net amount.

If the two conditions are not simultaneously met, it is assumed that the Group’s rights and obligations with
respect to these offsetting financial instruments are not exhausted in all situations by only the payment or
receipt of the net amount.

The offsetting policy is also related to the measurement, presentation and management of actual credit risk
and the liquidity risk pursuant from these offsetting instruments.

The criteria applied to establish the “current and legally enforceable entitlement to offsetting” are:

- lack of dependence on a future event, i.e. it should not only be applicable upon the occurrence of a future
event;

- the offsetting should be enforceable and legally defendable during (cumulatively):

   - the Company’s usual business operations;

   - in case of default/delay, and

   - in case of insolvency.

The applicability of criteria is measured against the requirements of the Bulgarian legislation and the
contractual relations between the parties. The condition of “presence of current and legally enforceable right
to offsetting”is always and mandatorily assessed together with the second condition—for “mandatory settling
of these instruments on a net basis”.

The Group applies netting with respect to financial assets and liabilities with other domestic and foreign
communications operators.

**Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting**

_Initial recognition and subsequent measurement_

The Group uses derivative financial instruments, such as currency forwards and interest rate swaps and options
respectively to hedge the risks related to change in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. These derivative
financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date of concluding the derivative contract.
Following their initial recognition, derivatives continue to be measured at fair valued. They are carried as
financial assets when the fair value is positive, and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.

For the purpose of hedge accounting, each hedge is classified based on its characteristics as:

- fair value hedges, whereas the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability or of an
unrecognized irrevocable commitment is hedged;

- cash flow hedges, whereas the exposure to variability of cash flows due to a specific risk related to a
recognised asset or liability or to a very probable forecast transaction, or to a currency risk related to an
unrecognized irrevocable commitment;

- hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation.

At the inception of the hedge there is formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship and
the Group ‘s risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge.

The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the
hedged risk, and the methods how the Group assess hedging relation for hedge effectiveness (including analysis
of the sources of ineffectiveness of the hedging and how the hedge ratio has been determined). A hedging
relation meets the requirements for hedge accounting if the three effectiveness requirements listed below have
been satisfied:

- there is an “economic relationship” between the hedged item and the hedging instrument;

- the effect of credit risk does not “dominate the value changes” that result from that economic relationship;

- the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged
item that the entity actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the entity actually uses
to hedge that quantity of hedged item.

Hedges that meet all criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for using the methods described herein
below:

_Fair value hedges_

The change in the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised within the respective item in the statement
of comprehensive income (within profit or loss for the year). The change in the fair value of the hedge position

**All amounts are in thousand BGN, unless otherwise stated**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

pursuant from the hedged risk is carried as a portion of the carrying amount of the hedged item and is also
recognised within the respective item in the statement of comprehensive income (within profit or loss for the
year).

In case of fair value hedges of items measured at amortised cost, any adjustment to the carrying amount shall
be amortised through profit or loss for the hedge period remaining to maturity, using the effective interest
method. Amortisation by means of effective interest may commence as soon as adjustments are made and not
later than the point of discontinuing the hedged item’s correlation as a result of fair value changes pursuant
from the hedged risk.

If the hedged item is derecognised, the unamortized fair value is immediately recognised in the statement of
comprehensive income (within profit or loss for the year).

When an unrecognised firm commitment has been designated as a hedged item, the subsequent cumulative
change in the fair value of the firm commitment pursuant from the hedged risk shall be recognised as asset or
liability by accounting for the respective gains or losses in the statement of comprehensive income (within
profit or loss for the year).

The Group has no outstanding transactions classified as fair value hedges.

_Cash flow hedges_

The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective is recognised in
other comprehensive income, respectively in the cash flow hedge reserve, while the hedge ineffectiveness is
immediately recognised in profit or loss. The cash flow hedge reserve is adjusted for reduction in the cumulative
gains or losses of the hedging instrument and the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedged item.

The Group uses currency forwards to hedge its currency risk exposure in forecast transactions and firm
commitments. The ineffective portion of currency contracts is recognised within “finance costs”. Moreover, it
uses interest rate swaps and interest rate cap options.

The Group only designates the spot component of forward contracts as a hedging instrument. The forward
component is recognised either: a) in profit or loss, or b) in other comprehensive income and is accumulated
within a separate component of equity, within cost of hedging reserve”. The choice is made on a hedge by
hedge basis. The accounting treatment of interest rate swaps and interest rate options is analogous, with the
changes in the time value of options recognized only within separate component of equity—”cost of hedging
reserve”.

The amounts that have been accumulated through other comprehensive income in “cash flow hedge reserve”
or “cost of hedging reserve” are accounted for depending on the nature of the underlying hedge transaction.
If the hedged transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial item, the amount
accumulated in equity is transferred from the respective reserve and is included in the initial cost or other
carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability. This is not a reclassification adjustment and hence is not
recognised in other comprehensive income for the period. This is also applicable in the cases where the hedged
forecast transaction for a non-financial asset or non-financial liability subsequently becomes a firm
commitment for which fair value hedge accounting is applied.

For all other cash flow hedges, the amount accumulated through other comprehensive income in “cash flow
hedge reserve”or “cost of hedging reserve”is reclassified into profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment in
the same period during which the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss.

If the Group discontinues hedge accounting for a cash flow hedge, the amount accumulated through other
comprehensive income in the cash flow hedge reserve is not reclassified if the hedged future cash flows are still
expected to occur.

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

Otherwise, the amount is immediately reclassified to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment. Following
the discontinuance, upon occurrence of the hedged cash flows, any outstanding amount in the reserve
accumulated through other comprehensive income is accounted for depending on the underlying transaction,
as described herein above.

**Financial guarantee contracts**

A financial guarantee contract is a contract that requires the issuer to make certain payments to recover the
holder’s loss incurred when a debtor failed to make payment when due, in accordance with the initial or
amended conditions of a debt instrument.

Financial guarantee contracts are recognised as financial liabilities. They are initially measured at fair value
and subsequently at the higher of:

- the amount determined in accordance with the expected credit losses model, and

- the amount initially recognised less, where appropriate, the cumulative amount of income recognised in
accordance with the principles of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.

The model of expected credit losses determines the expected credit loss (ECL) of the guarantee by taking into
consideration the debtor’s published or forecast credit rating, the term, interest rates and repayment plans,
adjusted for the guarantee’s specific conditions, such as default conditions, limits of liability, collaterals, etc.

The expected loss from financial guarantee contracts is included in “Other operating expenses” in the
statement of comprehensive income.

**2.11. Inventories**

Inventories are principally composed of handsets, network establishment and maintenance materials, valued
at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Materials and supplies are expensed when utilized, using the
weighted-average method. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business,
less estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. BTC sells handsets
separately and in connection with service contracts. As part of the strategy to acquire new customers, it sells
handsets, in connection with certain service contracts, at below their acquisition cost. The loss on the sale of
handsets is recognized at the time of the sale and the cost of the handsets is presented as “Materials and
consumables expenses” in the profit or loss for the period.

**2.12. Trade and other receivables**

Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method, less allowances for impairment.

An allowance for impairment of trade receivables is established for the expected credit losses, calculated as the
difference between the contractual cash flows due under the contractual conditions, and all cash flows the
Company expects to receive, discounted at the initial effective interest rate. Expected cash flows also include
cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that constitute an integral part of the
contractual conditions.

The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the
loss is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income as ‘Other operating expenses’. The resulting
carrying amount approximates the present value of estimated future cash flows. When a trade receivable is
uncollectible and the relevant legal grounds are present, it is written off against the allowance account for
trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited in ‘Other revenue’ in
the profit or loss for the period.

**2.13. Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, balances of current bank deposits, term deposits with original
maturity up to 3 months and all other amounts that are readily convertible into cash.

**2.14. Share capital**

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are
shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds. Where any BTC Group company purchases BTC’s share
capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs is
deducted from equity attributable to the company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled or reissued.
Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable
incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the BTC
Group equity holders.

**2.15. Trade and other payables**

Payables to suppliers and other current amounts payable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

**2.16. Interest-bearing loans and other borrowings**

All loans and other borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received on the
transaction, netted of the direct costs related to these loans and borrowings. After the initial recognition, the
interest-bearing loans and other borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost by applying the
effective interest rate method.

The amortised cost is calculated by taking into consideration all types of charges, commissions and other
costs, including any discount or premium associated with these loans. Amortisation is recognised in profit or
loss as a “finance costs” in the statement of comprehensive income.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group/Company has an unconditional right to defer
settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date. Borrowing costs directly attributable
to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to
get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the respective assets. All other
borrowing costs are expensed in the period they occur.

**2.17. Current and deferred income taxes**

The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the profit or loss,
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised
in equity.

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted at the reporting date.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable
tax regulation is subject to interpretation. The Group/Company establishes provisions where appropriate on
the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the
tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. However, the deferred
income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other
than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit
or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially
enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised
or the deferred income tax liability is settled.

Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will
be available, against which the temporary differences can be utilised.

Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and
associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the group and
it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

**2.18. Employee benefits**

**Defined contribution plans**

According to the Bulgarian legislation, the Group/Company is obliged to pay contributions to Social Security
Funds. This obligation relates to full-time employees and provides for paying contributions to state pension
fund by the employer and by the employee in the amount of certain percentages determined in the Social
Security Code. These contributions are charged to the profit or loss in the period to which they relate.

**Short-term employee benefits**

Short-term employee benefits in the form of remuneration, bonuses and social payments and benefits (payable
within 12 months after the end of the period when the employees have rendered the service or have met the
required terms and requirements) are recognized as an expense in the statement of comprehensive income in
the period when the service thereon has been rendered or the requirements for their receipt have been met and
as a current liability (less any amounts already paid and deductions due) at their undiscounted amount. The
Group’s/ Company’s obligations for social security and health insurance are recognized as a current expense
and liability at their undiscounted amount together with the relevant benefits and within the period of the
respective income to which they are related.

At each reporting date, the Group/Company measures the expected costs of the accumulating compensated
absences, which amount is expected to be paid as a result of the unused entitlement. The measurement includes
the estimated expenses on the employee’s remunerations and the statutory social security contributions due by
the employer thereon.

**Retirement benefit obligations**

In accordance with the requirements of the Labour Code, the employer is obliged to pay an indemnity to its
personnel upon coming of age for retirement, which depending on the length of service with the Group/
Company, varies between 2 and 6 gross monthly salaries as at the termination date of the employment. In
their nature, these are defined benefit plans.

The calculation of the amount of these retirement benefit obligations necessitates the participation of
qualified actuaries in order to determine their present value at the date of the financial statements, which is
included in the statement of financial position, and respectively, the change in their value, which is included in
the statement of comprehensive income. For this purpose, they apply the Projected Unit Credit Method.

Remeasurements arising from defined benefit plans comprise actuarial gains and losses and are recognised in
other comprehensive income (OCI). Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans
are recognised in profit or loss.

**Termination benefits**

The Group/Company recognises employee benefit obligations on employment termination before the normal
retirement date when it is demonstrably committed, based on announced plan, to terminating the employment
contract with the respective individuals without possibility of withdrawal or in case of formal issuance of
documents for voluntary redundancy. Termination benefits due more than 12 months are discounted and
presented in the statement of financial position at their present value.

**2.19. Provisions for other liabilities and charges**

Provisions are recognized when the Group/Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a
result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle (repay) the
obligation.

Restructuring provisions comprise employee termination payments.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED AND SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**For the year ended 31 December 2019**

**All amounts are in thousand BGN, unless otherwise stated**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

The measurement of provisions is based on the best estimate, made by the management at the reporting date,
concerning the expenses that will be incurred for the settlement of the particular obligation. The estimate is
discounted if the obligation maturity is long-term.

When part of the resources required to settle the obligation is expected to be recovered from a third party, the
Group recognises a receivable if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received, and its amount can
be reliably measured. Income is recognised in the same category of the profit or loss for the period where the
creations of the provision is charged.

**2.20. Revenue recognition**

Revenues comprise all revenues from the ordinary business activities of the Group and the Company, including
not only the core business but also other recurring sales of goods or rendering of services and income from
contractual penalties and default interest. Gains from sales of property, plant and equipment, investment
property or intangible assets are not classified as revenue but presented in other gains, net. Revenues are
recognized net of value-added tax in accordance with the provision of goods or services, if collectability of
the consideration is probable. For service contracts with a continuous service provision, the contractually
agreed total consideration is recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the minimum contract term,
regardless of the payment pattern.

A contract asset is recognized if corresponding revenue for fulfilment of a contractual performance obligation
is recorded before the customer has paid consideration or before the requirements for billing and thus the
recognition of a receivable exist. A contract liability is recognized when the customer has paid consideration
or a receivable from the customer is due before the Group or the Company has fulfilled a contractual
performance obligation. On a customer contract level, contract liabilities are set off against contract assets.

Multiple-element arrangements involving the delivery or provision of multiple products or services are
separated into distinct performance obligations, each with its own separate revenue contribution that is
recognized as revenue on fulfilment of the obligation to the customer. This is particularly applicable for sale
or lease of a mobile handset or other telecom equipment combined with the conclusion of a mobile or fixed
telecommunication service contract. The total transaction price of the contract is allocated among the
individual performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices. The stand-alone selling
prices are determined based on the list prices at which the Group sells the telecommunication services and
equipment. For items that are not sold separately, like options providing material right, the Group estimates
stand-alone selling prices reflecting the likelihood that the option will be exercised. As a result, the revenue to
be recognized for the telecom equipment usually delivered at contract inception and sold at a discounted price
in combination with a term service contract is higher than the amount billed. This leads to the recognition of
a contract asset in the statement of financial position. The contract asset is reversed and reduced over the
remaining minimum contract period, lowering revenue from the other performance obligations in the contract
(the telecommunication service). In contrast to the amounts billed, this results in higher revenue from the sale
of goods and merchandise and lower revenue from the provision of services.

One-time payments by the customer that do not constitute consideration for a separate performance
obligation are classified as contract liabilities and are deferred and recognized as revenue over the minimum
contract term. This is applicable to fees for installation and set-up activities that do not have an independent
value for the customer.

Options provided in the contract to the customer to purchase additional goods or services free of charge or at
a discount are separate performance obligations (material rights) for which part of the revenue is deferred as
a contract liability until the option is exercised or expires. Offers for the purchase of additional products or
services at their stand-alone prices are treated as marketing offers and are excluded when determining
consideration.

Long-term customer receivables arising from sales of telecom equipment in installments, contract assets
arising from sales of a telecom equipment at discount in connection with the conclusion of a term customer

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

contract or contract liabilities arising from a prepayment by the customer are recognized at present value if
the financing component is significant in relation to the total contract value, including those performance
obligations that do not contain a financing component.

Payments to customers, including subsequent discounts are recognized as a reduction in revenue unless the
payment constitutes consideration for a distinct good or service acquired from the customer, for which the
fair value can be reasonably estimated.

The incremental costs of obtaining a contract (mainly sales commission paid to employees and third-party
retailers) and the costs to fulfill a contract are capitalized if it can be assumed that the costs will be
compensated by future revenue from the contract. Incremental costs of obtaining a contract are additional
costs that would have not been incurred had the contract not been concluded. Costs to fulfill a contract are
costs relating directly to a contract that are incurred after contract inception and serve the purpose of fulfilling
the contract but are incurred prior to fulfillment and cannot be capitalized under any other standard.

The capitalized contract costs are presented as other assets in the statement of financial position and
recognised in the profit or loss as: 1) depreciation and amortization on a straight-line basis over the minimum
enforceable contract period, or 2) other operating expenses when impairment loss is recognized, if their
carrying amount exceeds the remaining amount of consideration that the Group expects to receive, less the
costs that relate directly to providing the goods or services that have not been recognized as expenses.

Principal activities from which the revenues are generated include provision of mobile and fixed voice and
data services, broadband internet access, pay TV services (DTH and IPTV), rent of terrestrial network (ducts),
TV and radio broadcasting, collocation services, connection and roaming fees billed to other operators, and
sales or lease of mobile handsets, other telecommunications equipment, and accessories. Services revenue is
recognized upon rendering of the agreed service. Services are usually billed and paid for on a monthly basis.
Revenue from non-sales-type rentals and leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Revenue and expenses associated with the sale of telecommunications equipment and accessories are
recognized when the products are delivered, provided there are no unfulfilled Group’s/Company’s obligations
that affect the customer’s final acceptance of the arrangement. For telecommunications equipment sold
separately, customers pay in full at the point of sale. For devices sold on lease in combination with a term
service contract, customers usually pay monthly in equal instalments over a period of 12 or 24 months.

**2.21. Expenses recognition**

Operating expenses are recognized as they are incurred, following the accrual and matching concepts.
Financial costs are recorded in the profit or loss for the period when incurred and comprise of: interest expense,
using the effective interest method, including bank charges and other direct expenses on loans and bank
guarantees, and exchange differences on loans denominated in foreign currency (net).

**2.22. Leases**

The accounting principles applicable to leases for 2019 (according to IFRS 16) and 2018 (IAS 17) are presented
below.

**2.22.1. Leases—accounting policies applied after 1 January 2019**

**The Group as lessee**

The Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease, at inception of a contract. The Group recognises
a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lease agreements in which it is the
lessee, except for leases of low value assets. For these leases, the Group recognises the lease payments as an
operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease unless another systematic basis is more
representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the
commencement date, discounted by using the rate implicit in the lease. If this rate cannot be readily

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

determined, which is generally the case for leases in the Group, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used,
being the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of
similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and
conditions.

To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Group uses a build-up approach that starts with a risk-free
interest rate adjusted for credit risk for the country and the Company and makes adjustments specific to the
lease, e.g. term, currency and security.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise:

- fixed lease payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives;

- variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the
commencement date;

- the amount expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;

- the exercise price of purchase options, if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the options; and

- payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the exercise of an option to
terminate the lease.

The lease liability is presented as Borrowings and lease liabilities in the consolidated and separate statement of
financial position.

The lease liability is subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease
liability (using the effective interest method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments
made.

The Group remeasures the lease liability (and makes a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use
asset) whenever:

- the lease term has changed or there is a change in the assessment of exercise of a purchase option, in which
case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate.

- the lease payments change due to changes in an index or rate or a change in expected payment under a
guaranteed residual value, in which cases the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease
payments using the initial discount rate (unless the lease payments change is due to a change in a floating
interest rate, in which case a revised discount rate is used).

- a lease contract is modified, and the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, in which
case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate.

The right-of-use assets comprise the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, lease payments
made at or before the commencement day and any initial direct costs. They are subsequently measured at cost
less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the shorter period of lease term and useful life of the underlying
asset. If a lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that
the Group expects to exercise a purchase option, the related right-of-use asset is depreciated over the useful
life of the underlying asset. The depreciation starts at the commencement date of the lease.

The right-of-use assets are presented as a separate line in the consolidated and separate statement of financial
position.

The Group applies IAS 36 Impairment of Assets to determine whether a right-of-use asset is impaired and
accounts for any identified impairment loss as described in Note 2.8.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED AND SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**For the year ended 31 December 2019**

**All amounts are in thousand BGN, unless otherwise stated**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

Variable rents that do not depend on an index or rate are not included in the measurement of the lease liability
and the right-of-use asset. The related payments are recognised as an expense in the period in which the event
or condition that triggers those payments occurs and are included in Other operating expenses in the statement
of comprehensive income.

The Group applies the practical expedient permitted by IFRS 16 not to separate non-lease components, and
instead account for any lease and associated non-lease components as a single arrangement.

**The Group as lessor**

Leases for which the Group is a lessor are classified as finance or operating leases. Whenever the terms of the
lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a
finance lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for the head lease and the sublease as two separate
contracts. The sublease is classified as a finance or operating lease by reference to the right-of-use asset arising
from the head lease.

Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recognised as receivables at the amount of the Group’s net
investment in the leases. Finance lease income is allocated to reporting periods so as to reflect a constant
periodic rate of return on the Group’s net investment outstanding in respect of the leases.

Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.

When a contract includes lease and non-lease components, the Group applies IFRS 15 to allocate the
consideration under the contract to each component.

**2.22.2. Leases—accounting policies applied until 31 December 2018**

Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and
rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

**The Group as lessee**

**Finance lease**

Assets held under finance leases are initially recognized as assets of the Group at their fair value at the
inception of the lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. The corresponding
liability to the lessor is included in the statement of financial position as Borrowings and lease liabilities.

Lease payments are apportioned between finance costs and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve
a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance costs are charged directly to profit
or loss. Contingent rentals are recognized as expenses in the periods in which they are incurred. Assets acquired
under the terms of finance lease are depreciated on the basis of the useful life of the asset over the lease term.

**Operating lease**

Operating lease payments are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term, except
where another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the
leased asset are consumed. Lease incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease
expense, over the term of the lease.

When assets are leased out under a finance lease, the present value of the lease payments is recognized as a
receivable. The difference between the gross receivable and the present value of the receivable represents an

unearned finance income. Lease income is recognized over the term of the lease using the net investment
method, which reflects a constant periodic rate of return.

**Operating lease**

When assets are leased out under an operating lease, the asset is included in the statement of financial position
based on the nature of the asset. Lease income is recognized over the term of the lease on a straight-line basis.

**2.23. Dividends Distribution**

Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholder is recognised as a liability in the Company’s financial
statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholder/Sole owner.

**3.** **Financial risk management**

**3.1. Financial risk factors**

In the ordinary course of business, the Group/Company can be exposed to a variety of financial risks the
most important of which are market risk that includes currency risk and interest risk, credit risk, and liquidity
risk. The financial risks are currently identified, measured and monitored by the Treasury Department and
the Managing Directors of each company within the Group through various control mechanisms in order to
establish adequate prices for the services, provided by the company, to appropriately assess the market
circumstances related to its investments and the forms for maintenance of free liquid funds through preventing
undue concentration of a particular risk.

Below are presented the various types of risks to which the companies of the Group are exposed upon
performing their business activities as well as the adopted approach for managing these risks.

**a)** **Credit risk**

Credit risks or the risk of counterparties defaulting, is controlled by the application of limits and monitoring
procedures. The Group has a policy of obtaining collateral from its retail customers who use mobile services
and from distributors. Credit risk is managed at a BTC Group level. It arises from cash and cash equivalents,
derivative financial instruments and deposits at banks, as well as from credit exposures to business and
households, including overdue receivables and commitments. The carrying amount of financial assets
represents the maximum credit exposure.

**Deposits at banks**

According to Treasury policy, applicable to BTC and its subsidiaries, transactions are carried out
predominantly with reputable financial institutions. Credit exposure is controlled by individual credit limits
of counterparties, which are regularly revised and appropriately approved. The limit for each third party is
determined according to its size in terms of assets and equity as well as its long-term credit rating from S&P,
Moody’s or Fitch. The Treasury policy also defines the financial instruments, allowed to the Treasury
Department, as well as the maximum maturity.

**Receivables and commitments**

Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, distributed by industries. The fixed business of BTC
follows the approved by CRC “General Rules of Contracts between BTC and Subscribers”. The management
of risk of non-payment of retail customers is carried out through a policy of suspension and termination of
services, based on credit risk segmentation. The retail subscribers’ contracts termination follows the General
Conditions.

BTC has adopted a policy for mutual connection with telecom operators and wholesale with partners with
good credit ratings by applying of respective guarantees for risk management.

**3.** **Financial risk management (continued)**

The credit risk related to international accounts is managed through the availability of net arrangement
between the contractual parties and by directing traffic through chosen routes in order to decrease existing
exposures. The management is satisfied with the level of risk concentration in receivables as disclosed in
Note 6.

The credit worthiness of the customers is evaluated according to their financial status, payment history and
other factors. On the basis of the credit score individual credit limits are set in compliance with the credit
policy. The levels of the credit limits and their daily observation are monitored. Most of the payments from
customers of mobile services are in cash.

As a result of the assigned receivables on cash deposits in CCB in 2014 and the subsequent cancellation of
transactions as disclosed in Note 6 below the Group has recognized loans and other receivables representing
the majority of the balance of “Other receivables” as of 31 December 2019 and 2018, which amounts to
respectively BGN 33,326 and BGN 32,678 thousand. The receivables are due by several counterparties, one
economic group of which represents more than 50% of the total balance. As at the reporting date all of these
outstanding loan receivables are impaired in full. Apart from this and the disclosed in Note 6, BTC Group is
not exposed to credit risk from an individual partner or group of partners with similar profile. Trade relations
with related parties are similar to those with third parties.

**b)** **Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk arises from the mismatch of the contractual maturity of monetary assets and liabilities and the
possibility that trade debtors may not be able to settle obligations to the Company/Group within the normal
terms of trade. To manage such risk, the Parent company uses planning techniques, including but not limited
to, arrangement of revolving and/or overdraft facilities, daily liquidity reports, and short and medium-term
cash forecasts.

_Maturity analysis_

The table below presents the financial liabilities of the Group/Company, grouped by remaining term to
maturity, determined against the contractual maturity at the reporting date. The table is prepared on the basis
of contracted undiscounted cash flows and the earliest date on which the liability becomes due for payment.
The amounts include principal and interest.

For 2019 the financial liabilities are as follows:

**c)** **Market risk**

**Currency risk**

The main objective of Group’s/Company’s currency risk management is to minimize any adverse effects of
market volatility on exchange rates so as to provide the maximum value of foreign currency net income and
under pre-determined and approved risk level.

Due to the fact that the companies within BTC Group use mainly BGN and EUR as operating currencies
they are not significantly exposed to currency risk. Most of the income is generated in BGN while long term
and revolving financing, interest payments and part of the capital expenses are in EUR. This mismatch has
not been a problem for the past years as the Bulgarian lev is pegged to the euro. At the same time the stability
of the currency board needs to be monitored closely since a potential free floating of the local currency and
devaluation of the BGN will significantly affect the financial situation of the Group.

Due to forecasted purchases of equipment the Group/Company identified currency risk, arising as a result of
certain exposure to the USD. According to the Treasury policy of the Group/Company and in compliance
with its foreign exchange risk management strategy, the foreign exchange risk arising from these highly
probable forecasted purchases may be hedged. The hedges are cash flow hedges and are classified as financial
assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.

When significant foreign currency exposure arises, the Group/Company takes into account the following
factors:

- Future outlook on volatility of financial market variables. These are modelled by Treasury and in
accordance with best practice analytical techniques and economic models

- effect of the given foreign exchange exposure on total Group/Company financial results

- cost of foreign exchange exposure hedging

BTC’s Treasury department mainly uses forward contracts to hedge foreign exchange risk. All derivatives are
entered into with credible counterparties and in compliance with the Treasury policy of the Group.

**Interest rate risk**

During 2018 and 2019 due to the European Central Bank policy the interest rates were generally negative and
thus the Group/Company was paying only the applicable margin on its bank loans. As of 31 December 2019,

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED AND SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**For the year ended 31 December 2019**

**All amounts are in thousand BGN, unless otherwise stated**

**3.** **Financial risk management (continued)**

liabilities of BTC sensitive to interest rates amount to BGN 645,082 thousand (2018: BGN 756,906 thousand)
and the interest payments are principally based on EURIBOR. In 2018 the Company decided to conclude
two forward starting hedge deals on the interest rate of the Senior Facilities Agreement. 70% of the initial
principal amount of Term Loan A is hedged for the period from April 2020 to April 2023. 88% of the
outstanding principal of Term Loan B is hedged for the period from April 2020 to April 2023.

If the variable components of the interest rate on non-fixed interest rate borrowings were 1% higher, that
would have resulted in an increase of interest expenses for 2019 by BGN 4,708 thousand (2018: increase by
BGN 3,269 thousand) therefore, the consolidated profit after taxation would have been BGN
133,463 thousand (2018: BGN 124,786 thousand). If the variable components of the interest rate on nonfixed interest rate borrowings were 1% lower, that would have not resulted in a change of interest expenses and
consolidated profit after tax for 2019 and 2018.

**3.2. Capital risk management**

The Group manages its equity in order to perform its activity as a going concern and to balance the return on
equity of shareholders by optimizing the debt to equity ratio in the medium term. The equity structure of the
Group/Company consists of long-term borrowings (Note 16), cash and cash equivalents (Note 5) and equity,
including share capital, retained earnings and reserves.

In accordance with the Bulgarian Commercial Act as a joint-stock company BTC is required to maintain
equity at an amount which is higher than its registered share capital and legal reserves at an amount of
minimum 10% of the registered share capital. As at 31 December 2019, the Company’s equity is in excess of its
registered share capital by BGN 369,325 thousand (31 December 2018: BGN 275,255 thousand).

Group’s management reviews its equity structure on an annual basis. The gearing ratios as of 31
December 2019 and 2018 are as follows:

**Consolidated financial** **Separate financial**
**statements** **statements**

**31.12.2019** **31.12.2018** **31.12.2019** **31.12.2018**

During the period gearing has improved for the Group and did not change for the Company, despite the
adoption of IFRS 16 which increased the amount of lease liabilities. The management aims to keep the ratio
below 300%.

**4.** **Critical accounting estimates and judgments**

The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates could
differ from the related actual results. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on
historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances.

**BULGARIAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY EAD**

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED AND SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**For the year ended 31 December 2019**

**All amounts are in thousand BGN, unless otherwise stated**

**4.** **Critical accounting estimates and judgments (continued)**

The estimates and assumptions that might have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next year are discussed below:

**a)** **Impairment of goodwill, tangible and intangible assets**

The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the accounting
policy stated in note 2.6. The ability of a tangible and intangible asset to generate sufficient future economic
benefits to recover its carrying amount is usually subject to greater uncertainty. In performing these
assessments of recoverable amount, a significant number of estimates and judgments are required including
but not limited to:

- An estimate of future cash flows expected to derive from these assets,

- Expectations about possible variations in the amount or timing of those future cash flows,

- The designation of the cash generating unit for which future cash flows are derived. The cash
generating units identified for the Group are: fixed business, mobile business, collocation business and
radio and TV broadcasting business

- The time value of money represented by weighted average cost of capital (WACC).

- Perpetual growth rate (PGR).

For the last couple of years prior to 2018, the Group has been conducting annual impairment testing of its
assets and no need for impairment has been identified. Taking into account the above and the fact that the
Group performs in line with its projections and based on the assessment that no internal or external indicators
exist affecting the recoverable amount of the assets or triggering the need for annual impairment test of assets,
the Management considers that the carrying amount of the assets as of 31 December 2019 does not exceed
their recoverable amount.

**b)** **Useful lives of assets**

The determination of the useful lives of assets is based on historical experience with similar assets as well as
any anticipated technological development and changes in broad economic or industry factors. The
appropriateness of the estimated useful lives is reviewed annually, or whenever there is an indication of
significant changes in the underlying assumptions. We believe that the accounting estimate related to the
determination of the useful lives of assets is a critical accounting estimate since it involves assumptions about
technological development in an innovative industry. Further, due to the significant weight of depreciable
assets in our total assets, the impact of any changes in these assumptions could be material to our financial
position, and results of operations.

Were the actual useful lives of the assets to differ by 10% from management’s estimates, the carrying value of
the consolidated plant and equipment and respectively consolidated depreciation and amortization charges
would be estimated BGN 16,611 thousand higher/lower.

**c)** **Provisions, decommissioning costs and contingent liabilities**

Whether a provision or contingent liability is recognized or disclosed in the financial statements is dependent
on a number of assumptions and judgments being made by the management. A provision is recognized when
the Group has a present obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be
required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Contingent liabilities are not recognized because their existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or
non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group.

Contingent liabilities are assessed continually to determine whether an outflow of resource embodying
economic benefits has become probable. If it becomes probable that an outflow of future economic benefits
will be required for an item previously dealt with as a contingent liability, a provision is recognized in the
financial statements for the period in which the change in probability occurs.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED AND SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**For the year ended 31 December 2019**

**All amounts are in thousand BGN, unless otherwise stated**

**4.** **Critical accounting estimates and judgments (continued)**

Based on detailed assessment, supported by legal opinions, of each of the cases disclosed in Note 28
management concluded that it is highly unlikely an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits to
happen. Accordingly, no liability or provision has been recognized as at December 31, 2019, unless otherwise
disclosed. These issues are expected to be resolved by the competent court after considering all arguments set
out by BTC group companies.

**d)** **Going concern**

The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. In 2019 the Group realized a profit of BGN
137,700 thousand (2018—profit of BGN 127,728 thousand). The Group’s net current assets as at
31 December 2019 are amounting to BGN 294,941 thousand (as at 31 December 2018: BGN
56,386 thousand). The future viability of the Group depends upon the business environment as well as upon
the continuing support of the owners and providers of finance. The directors, in light of their assessment of
expected future cash flows and the potential impact as disclosed in Note 4 l) below are satisfied that it is
appropriate for the financial statements to be prepared on a going concern basis.

**e)** **Revenue recognition, contract assets and liabilities**

Multiple-element arrangements involving the delivery or provision of multiple products or services are
assessed to determine whether it is necessary to separate the different identifiable components and apply the
corresponding revenue recognition policy to each element. The transaction price for the entire multipleelement arrangement is allocated among the identified elements based on their respective standalone selling
prices. Determining standalone selling prices for each identified element requires estimates that are complex
due to the nature of the business. A change in estimates of standalone selling prices could affect the allocation
of revenue among the elements and, as a result, the timing of recognition of revenues and the carrying amount
of contract assets and liabilities.

**f)** **Purchase price accounting**

The Group assesses the initial accounting for business combinations by identifying and determining the fair
value to be assigned to the acquired identifiable assets, liabilities, contingent liabilities, and the cost of the
combination. The initial accounting for business combinations is determined provisionally by the end of the
period in which the combination is affected. Either the fair valued to be assigned to the acquired liabilities or
contingent liabilities or the cost of combination can be determined only provisionally. The Group recognizes
any adjustments to those provisional values as a result of concluding the initial accounting within
twelve months of the acquisition date.

**g)** **Allowance for impairment of trade and other receivables, leases, and contract assets**

An allowance for impairment of trade and other receivables is established for estimated losses resulting from
the inability of customers to make due payments. When evaluating the adequacy of an allowance for doubtful
accounts, management bases its estimates on the aging of accounts receivable balances and historical write-off
experience, customer creditworthiness, and estimated probability of default. If the financial condition of
customers were to deteriorate, actual write-offs might be higher than expected.

**h)** **Income tax provision**

The Group is subject to income taxes in the Bulgarian tax jurisdiction. Significant judgment is required in
determining the provision for income taxes. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax due based on
management estimates. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were
initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in
which such determination is made.

**4.** **Critical accounting estimates and judgments (continued)**

**i)** **Assignment of receivables on cash deposits**

The transactions for assignment of receivables on cash deposits in Corporate Commercial Bank AD—in
bankruptcy (CCB), refer also to notes 5 and 6, were executed in 2014 as per the provisions of the applicable
law. The critical judgments related to these transactions are summarized below.

In August 2015 two of the transactions concluded in 2014 for the assignment of cash deposits in CCB were
terminated and as a result the assignments were cancelled with retroactive effect where BTC became a
titleholder of the assigned receivables in the amount of BGN 53,033 thousand (BGN 9,970 thousand, net of
impairment as of 31 December 2019). Despite of the validly executed transactions, the receivers of CCB have
not included the cancelled assignments in the list of accepted receivables of CCB creditors.

These issues are expected to be resolved by the competent court after considering all arguments set out by
BTC Group companies. The final court resolutions may have an impact on the value of the recognized assets
and liabilities by the Group and respectively affect the profit or loss.

**j)** **Fair value measurement**

Some of the Group’s assets and liabilities are measured and presented and/or only disclosed at fair value for
the purpose of financial reporting. Such are: a) on a recurrent (annual) basis—financial assets at fair value
through other comprehensive income, derivative contracts used for hedging at fair value through profit or
loss, investment property, loans granted or borrowings received to/from third or related parties, certain trade
and other receivables and payables, finance lease receivables and payables, etc. and b) on a non-recurrent
(periodic) basis—non-financial assets such as property, plant and equipment.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in a common
transaction between independent market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is an exit price and
is based on the assumption that the sale transaction will take place either in the principal market for this asset
or liability or in the absence of a principal market—in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
Both the designated as a principal market and the most advantageous market are markets to which the Group
must have an access.

Fair value is measured from the perspective of using the assumptions and judgments that potential market
participants would use when pricing the respective asset or liability assuming that market participants act in
their economic best interest.

In measuring the fair value of non-financial assets the starting point is always the assumption what would be
the highest and best use of the particular asset for the market participants.

The Group applies various valuation techniques that would be relevant to the specific features of the respective
conditions and for which it has sufficient available inputs while trying to use at a maximum the publicly
observable information, and respectively, to minimize the use of unobservable information. It uses the three
acceptable approaches—the market approach, the income approach and the cost approach—whereas the
most frequently applied valuation techniques include directly quoted and/or adjusted quoted market prices,
market comparables (analogues) and discounted cash flows, including based on capitalised rental income.

All assets and liabilities that are measured and/or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value, are
categorised within the following fair value hierarchy, namely:

- Level 1—Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

- Level 2—Valuation techniques that use inputs other than directly quoted prices but are observable, either
directly or indirectly, including where the quoted prices are subject to significant adjustments; and

- Level 3—Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement is unobservable.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED AND SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**For the year ended 31 December 2019**

**All amounts are in thousand BGN, unless otherwise stated**

**4.** **Critical accounting estimates and judgments (continued)**

For assets and liabilities that are recognised at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the
Group determines at the end of each reporting period whether transfers between levels in the fair value
hierarchy are deemed to be made for a particular asset or liability depending on the inputs available and used
at that date.

The Group uses the expertise of external certified valuators to determine the fair value of the following assets
and liabilities: derivative hedge instruments Level 2 and Level 3, investment properties, investments in equity
instruments not quoted on an active market, property, plant and equipment. The choice of such valuators is
made on an annual basis using the following criteria: applied professional standards, professional experience
and knowledge, reputation and market status.

When the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities carried in the statement of financial position
cannot be obtained based on quoted prices on active markets, their fair value is determined by using other
valuation models and techniques, including the discounted cash flows model. The input used in these models
is obtained from observable markets, where possible, but when this cannot be done, significant judgement is
applied to determine fair values. Such judgement involves the review, analysis and assessment of input, for
instance regarding liquidity risk, credit risk, and volatility. The changes in assumptions for these factors may
impact the amount of the fair value of financial instruments

**k)** **Determining the lease term and the incremental borrowing rate**

In determining the lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic
incentive to exercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods
after termination options) are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended
(or not terminated).

If there are significant penalties to terminate (or not extend), or any leasehold improvements are expected to
have a significant remaining value, the Group is typically reasonably certain to extend (or not terminate).
Other factors including historical lease durations and the costs and business disruption required to replace the
leased asset are also considered. For lease contracts with indefinite term or short-term technical site rentals
the Group estimates the length of the contract to be equal to the economic useful life of non-current assets
located in the leased property.

The lease term is reassessed if an option is actually exercised (or not exercised) or the Group becomes obliged
to exercise (or not exercise) it. The assessment of reasonable certainty is only revised if a significant event or
a significant change in circumstances occurs, which affects this assessment, and that is within the control of
the lessee.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the
commencement date, discounted by using the rate implicit in the lease. If this rate cannot be readily
determined, which is generally the case for leases in the Group, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used,
being the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of
similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and
conditions.

To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Group uses a build-up approach that starts with a risk-free
interest rate adjusted for credit risk for the country and the Company and makes adjustments specific to the
lease, e.g. term, currency and security.

**l)** **COVID-19 (Coronavirus) epidemic**

The rapid development of the Covid-19 virus and its social and economic impact in Bulgaria and globally, as
disclosed in Note 31, may result in assumptions and estimates requiring revisions which may lead to material
adjustments to the carrying value of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. In particular
management expects the assumptions and estimates used in determining Trade and other receivables, Contract
assets, Property, plant and equipment, Intangible assets, Right-of-use assets and the related Deferred tax

assets and liabilities to be affected. At this stage management is not able to reliably estimate the impact as
events are unfolding day-by-day.

The longer term impact may also affect trading volumes, cash flows and profitability. Nevertheless, at the date
of these financial statements the Company continues to meet its obligations as they fall due and therefore
continues to apply the going concern basis of preparation.

As disclosed in Note 16 BTC secured the payments related to Company’s liabilities under the SFA by
establishing a pledge on the receivables under certain bank accounts and insurance policies.

On 20.06.2014 the Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) placed one of the servicing banks of the Group—
Corporate Commercial Bank (CCB)—under special supervision. On 6 November 2014 BNB Governing
Council announced its decision to revoke CCB’s license for conducting banking activities and to submit
petition to the competent court of law to open bankruptcy proceedings. On these grounds the cash available
in current and deposit accounts at CCB as at the reporting date has been presented as receivables, as disclosed
in note 6.

Money kept in bank deposits can be withdrawn at any time on demand of the Company and is held to meet
short term operational needs.

The availability of cash in current accounts and short term deposits is allocated in banks with long term credit
ratings from S&P as follows:

Other receivables as at 31 December 2019 include BGN 84 thousand for the consolidated and for the separate
financial statements term cash deposits with maturity greater than three months (as at 31 December 2018:
BGN 430 thousand).

On 4 May 2015, being a central billing party (CBP) of MECMA 2014 agreement and acting in good faith,
BTC entered into agreement with the members of MECMA in relation to the cash of MECMA blocked in
CCB. As per the agreed terms, all affected MECMA members assigned to BTC their receivables from CCB
amounting to BGN 11,819 thousand (EUR 6,043 thousand), along with all accrued interest, and BTC paid
50% of the assigned amount in cash. The agreement is full and final settlement of all potential disputes
regarding MECMA’s cash blocked in CCB. The assigned receivables from CCB are included in trade
receivables.

In August 2015 two of the transactions concluded in 2014 for the assignment of cash deposits in CCB were
terminated and as a result the assignments were cancelled with retroactive effect where BTC became a
titleholder of the assigned receivables in the amount of BGN 53,033 thousand (BGN 9,970 thousand, net of
impairment as of 31 December 2019 and BGN 9,680 thousand, net of impairment as of 31 December 2018).

Trade receivables for the consolidated and for the separate financial statements as of 31 December 2019
include respectively BGN 60,179 thousand and BGN 59,152 thousand representing the remaining cash and
cash equivalents at CCB (after the assignment of receivables on cash deposits of the Group and the Company
in 2014 and the above mentioned transactions). The nominal value of the cash accounts at CCB as of
31 December 2019 is respectively BGN 66,089 thousand and BGN 65,062 thousand for the Group and the
Company. The receivables representing the remaining cash and cash equivalents at CCB are presented as
non-current. Their net book value as of 31 December 2019 amounts to BGN 12,403 thousand and BGN
12,232 thousand for the consolidated and for the separate financial statements, respectively, and the

accumulated impairment is respectively BGN 47,776 thousand and BGN 46,920 thousand. Net book value as
of 31 December 2018 amounts to BGN 12,042 thousand and BGN 11,875 thousand for the consolidated and
for the separate financial statements, respectively, and the accumulated impairment is respectively BGN
48,137 thousand and BGN 47,277 thousand.

Based on the data disclosed by Bulgarian Deposit Insurance Fund the management has made an assessment
of the collectability of the cash in CCB as at the reporting date, which was estimated to approximate 19%
(19% as of 31 December 2018). In 2018 the initially assumed recovery date has been revised. As a result,
impairment related to the receivables representing cash at CCB amounting to BGN 261 thousand for the
Group and BGN 257 thousand for the Company has been recognized and included under other operating
expenses for 2018 (note 21).

Part of the non-current trade receivables are due within two years from the end of the reporting period and
relate to sales of mobile phone sets on finance lease agreements with customers. The net investment in finance
leases for the Group and BTC may be analysed as follows:

The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime
expected loss allowance for the majority of the trade receivables and all lease receivables. The expected loss
rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over a period of 24 months before 31 December 2019 and
31 December 2018 respectively and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period.
The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic
factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables. On that basis, the loss allowance as at 31
December 2019 and 31 December 2018 was determined as follows for trade and lease receivables:

Incremental costs of obtaining a contract are additional costs that would have not been incurred had the
contract not been concluded. They comprise mainly sales commission paid to employees and third-party
retailers. Costs to fulfil a contract are costs relating directly to a contract that are incurred after contract
inception and serve the purpose of fulfilling the contract but are incurred prior to fulfilment and cannot be
capitalized under any other standard. The capitalized contract costs are recognised in the profit or loss as: 1)
depreciation and amortization on a straight-line basis over the minimum enforceable contract period, or 2)
other operating expenses when impairment loss is recognized, if their carrying amount exceeds the remaining
amount of consideration that the Group expects to receive, less the costs that relate directly to providing the
goods or services that have not been recognized as expenses.

**Measurement of fair value**

_Fair value hierarchy_

Land is measured at fair value, in accordance with the revaluation model of IAS 16. The fair value of land was
determined as at 31 December 2018 by external, independent property valuers, having appropriate recognized
professional qualification and recent experience in the location and category of the property being valued.

The fair value measurement for land of BGN 5,361 thousand has been categorised as a Level 3 fair value
based on the inputs to the valuation technique used.

The following table shows a reconciliation from the opening balances to the closing balances for Level 3 fair
values.

_Valuation technique and significant unobservable inputs_

The valuation technique used is Market comparison—the fair value is based on the market price of properties
with similar location and category. At the date of valuation no active market existed and the market value was
determined based on offers to sell similar plots under the assumption that these are the end prices. The offered
prices have been adjusted with: discount rate ranging from 10% to 15% to reflect the actual reduction in the
offered price, based on the trends of actual transactions; adjustment coefficients, derived on the basis of
characteristics of the respective plots like size, environmental and geomorphologic condition, level of
development and transport accessibility, and improvements of the land. The estimated fair value of the
individual properties would increase/(decrease) had the respective discount rate were lower/(higher) and the
adjustments coefficients were higher/(lower).

**b)** **Investment property**

As a result of the improvements and modernization of its fixed network during the past years BTC achieved
substantial optimization of the technical areas in its own buildings. The level of usage of each building is
being assessed as at the end of each reporting period. Where the Group uses only part of a property it owns,
utilisation of less than 25% is regarded as immaterial and the property is presented as an investment property.

The fair value of the investment properties as at 31 December 2019 in the separate financial statements
amounts to BGN 140,918 thousand (2018: BGN 149,775 thousand) and was determined by external,
independent property valuers, having appropriate recognized professional qualification and experience.

_Valuation technique and significant unobservable inputs_

The valuation technique used is Market comparison—the fair value is based on the market price of properties
with similar location and category. At the date of valuation, no active market existed and the market value
was determined based on the market comparable approach that reflects recent transaction prices for similar
properties. The transactions prices have been adjusted with: market indices to reflect the actual changes in the
offered price, based on the trends of actual transactions; adjustment coefficients, derived on the basis of
characteristics of the respective plots like size, environmental and geomorphologic condition, level of
development and transport accessibility, and improvements of the properties. The estimated fair value of the
individual properties would increase/(decrease) had the respective market indices were higher/(lower) and the
adjustments coefficients were higher/(lower).

On 17 April 2019 a joint venture (Paytech OOD) between BTC and Bulgarian-American Credit Bank AD
was registered in the Bulgarian Commercial Register following competition clearance by the Bulgarian
Competition Protection Commission granted on 28 March 2019. On 7 October 2019 BTC sold its 50% share
in Paytech OOD to Bulgarian-American Credit Bank AD.

With a notice dated 6 July 2019 BTC notified Viva Telecom Bulgaria OOD that it terminates its participation
as a shareholder in Viva Telecom Bulgaria OOD upon expiry of 4 (four) months as of receipt of the notice.
According to the provisions of the Commercial Act the receivable of BTC was determined on the basis of the
balance sheet of Viva Telecom Bulgaria OOD as of 30 November 2019, as disclosed in Note 27. The change
in the fair value of the investment for the ten months ended 31 October 2019 amounts to BGN
18,412 thousand. The total accumulated fair value reserve, net of tax, as of the date of termination of the
participation, amounting to BGN 23,632 thousand was transferred in retained earnings in 2019.

The other changes in values of the investments in equity securities are due to their measurement to fair value.

In November 2013 BTC announced the successful completion of its debut bond offering of EUR 400 million
6[5]∕8% Senior Secured Notes due 2018 on the Irish Stock Exchange pursuant to Rule 144A / Regulation S (the
“Notes”). The proceeds from the bond offering were used by the Company to repay its existing indebtedness
under the amended and restated loan agreement in full. The interest on the Notes was payable semi-annually
on May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing May 15, 2014. In relation to the admission of the
Notes the Company received a credit rating of B1 by Moody’s and BB- by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services.
On 29 March 2018 and 16 May 2018 respectively, Moody’s upgraded the long-term corporate credit rating of
the Company to Ba3 and S&P Global Ratings reconfirmed it as BB- and in November 2019 both agencies
placed the corporate credit ratings on review. On 27 March 2020 S&P Global Ratings downgraded the
corporate credit rating to B+.

BTC underwent a consent solicitation procedure for a waiver of the existing change of control provisions and
amendment of certain definitions and ratios applicable to the Notes. The procedure was initiated in relation
to the acquisition by VTL of 100% of the shares of InterV Investment S.a.r.l. On 13 June 2016, Vivacom
obtained the necessary consent of 87.43% of bondholders.

The amendments of Notes’ provisions entered into effect upon the execution of the first supplemental
indenture on June 10, 2016 which became operative on 7 September 2016, when all the conditions precedent
in the first supplemental indenture were either satisfied or waived.

Simultaneously with the bond offering BTC concluded EUR 35 million Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) with
Societe Generale Expressbank AD under which the Company may borrow funds for the repayment of its debt
under the amended and restated loan agreement, financing of its working capital purposes and issue of bank
guarantees and letters of credit. The RCF was initially agreed to be available up to 30 November 2016. The
interest on the principal amounts owing by the Company under the RCF is payable monthly and was initially
agreed to be the aggregate of 1 month EURIBOR plus a margin of 4% per year. Effective from 26 May 2014
the margin was reduced to 3,75% per year and from 14 November 2016 the margin was further reduced to
1,45% per year and the term was extended to 31 May 2018.

On 22 December 2017 the Company entered into an up to EUR 365 million Senior Facilities Agreement
(SFA) arranged by Citibank N.A., London Branch and VTB Bank (Deutschland) AG (currently VTB Bank
(Europe) SE). The purpose of the facility is to refinance all amounts due under the Existing HY Bonds,
payment of fees and costs under the facility and capital expenditure in respect of the Company’s investment
and development program. The SFA comprises of a term loan Facility A, term loan Facility B, a Short-term

Deferred tax assets and liabilities for different taxable entities are not offset as they cannot be settled on a net
basis and it is not expected that the assets will be realised and the liabilities will be settled simultaneously in the
future.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in
the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The deferred tax assets
and liabilities as of 31 December 2019 and 2018 are calculated in these financial statements at 10% tax rate
which is effective as of 1 January 2007.

The last period audited by the tax authorities for BTC is 2013. On 05 June 2015 a tax assessment act has been
issued for a tax audit, covering the period January 2007—December 2009, assessing BGN 10,235 thousand
corporate income tax and interest due. On 23 April 2018 the Supreme Administrative Court has repealed the
tax assessment act for the majority of the assessed tax in the amount of BGN 10,070 thousand and for the
remaining assessed tax the case has been returned to the lower administrative court for further review. On
22 December 2015 a tax assessment act has been issued for a tax audit, covering the period January 2010–
December 2013, assessing BGN 2,278 thousand corporate income tax and interest due. On 14 November 2018
the Supreme Administrative Court has repealed the tax assessment act.

The last period audited by the tax authorities for BTC Net is 2014.

The last period audited by the tax authorities for NURTS Bulgaria and NURTS Digital is 2013.

**18.** **Retirement benefit obligations (continued)**

Currently no assets have been allocated for covering the long-term staff benefits in a separate fund and there

The present consolidated and separate financial statements include a provision for employee benefits
obligation, which is measured applying the projected unit credit method.

The movement of the liability, recognized in the statement of financial position, is as follows:

Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on actuarial advice in accordance with
published statistics. Mortality assumptions are based on the statistical information, provided by the National
Statistical Institute for the total mortality of the population in Bulgaria for the period 2016-2018.

The calculation of the defined benefit obligation is sensitive to the assumptions set out above. The following
table summarises how the impact of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period would
have increased (decreased) as a result of a change in the respective assumptions by one percent.

The balance of the receivable from NURTS Bulgaria EAD includes principal and interest on loan provided
by BTC to the subsidiary entity. The applicable interest rate is 6.5% p.a. and the total outstanding principal
amount and accumulated interest were agreed to be fully repaid on 20 May 2016. The loan is secured with first
ranking non-possessory pledges in accordance with the Special Pledges Act on the going concerns of NURTS
Bulgaria EAD and NURTS Digital EAD, which includes among other certain real estates and other assets of
the companies. In November 2015 NURTS Bulgaria failed to repay one of the instalments due to BTC and as
a result the Company has appointed a manager of the going concern of NURTS Digital EAD. The interest
income recognised for the year ended 31 December 2019 in the separate financial statements amounts to
BGN 61 thousand (BGN 131 thousand for the year ended 31 December 2018).

The increase in the balance of the receivable from Viva Telecom Bulgaria EOOD is due to the termination of
the participation of BTC, as disclosed in Note 12. After the reporting date the receivable was agreed to be
settled as per the terms of a loan, with interest rate determined as the aggregate of 12M Euribor plus a margin
of 7% p.a. and due date 17.07.2021.

**29.** **Contingencies**

The Company is a participant in several lawsuits and administrative proceedings.

On 4 July 2016, Empreno Ventures Limited commenced legal proceedings in Bulgaria, challenging the validity
of the first supplemental indenture (as referred in Note 16). Following the review on three instances, the
Bulgarian courts finally dismissed the case on 16 March 2017 and the claim was rejected. On 26 August 2016,
LIC Telecommunications S.à r.l. commenced legal proceedings in Luxembourg that, among other things,
challenge the validity of the first supplemental indenture (as disclosed in Note 16) and claim damages
amounting to EUR 62 million. In 2018 and 2019 judgments were rendered by two instance courts in
Luxembourg which declared the request of LIC Telecommunications S.à r.l inadmissible and declined
jurisdiction, which entered into force. BTC considers the legal proceedings in both Bulgaria and Luxembourg
as being unmeritorious and devoid of any proper legal basis.

The transactions for assignment of receivables on cash deposits in Corporate Commercial Bank AD—in
bankruptcy (CCB), were executed in 2014 as per the provisions of the applicable law. One of the assigned
receivables was utilised by NURTS Bulgaria EAD in order to set-off its obligations to CCB under a bond
issued by NURTS Bulgaria EAD in 2013. CCB held 25,723 bonds with a nominal of EUR 1,000 each and in
September 2014 NURTS Bulgaria EAD has set-off the principal in the amount of BGN 50,310 and applicable
interest due to CCB in the amount of BGN 1,350 thousand against its own cash held in CCB accounts and
assigned CCB cash receivables from third parties, including BTC. Despite of the validly executed transactions,
the receivers of CCB have recognized only partially the set-off from NURTS Bulgaria EAD (BGN
1,543 thousand) where the remaining amount of BGN 50,117 thousand and other owned cash in CCB of
BGN 116 thousand is included in the list of accepted receivables of CCB creditors. No financial assets or
liabilities in relation to this matter were recognized in these financial statements. On 2 May 2017 NURTS
Bulgaria EAD was notified for commencement by CCB of legal proceedings for the challenge of the set-off.

On 14 May 2018 the first instance court cast a decision, as a result of which the NURTS set-offs against CCB
were declared partially null and void and partially invalid vis-à-vis the creditors of CCB. The decision has not
entered into force and has been appealed before the Sofia Court of Appeal.

On 12 December 2019 CCB has withdrawn its claim against NURTS and on 20 December 2019 has initiated
a procedure for the sale of the bonds held by CCB within which the above-referred issues between CCB and
NURTS were finally resolved after the reporting date. As a result, a provision was recognized by NURTS as
disclosed in Note 15.

Based on the information available, management is satisfied that there is no unprovided liability arising from
the outstanding lawsuits and administrative proceedings, however there are inherent uncertainties related to
the outcome of the cases. The recognised provisions for lawsuits are further disclosed in Note 15.

The Group has bank guarantees issued to third parties which amount to BGN 2,738 thousand as of 31
December 2018 (2018: BGN 2,359 thousand).

NURTS Bulgaria EAD was notified by CCB that pursuant to a contract concluded on January 16, 2013 the
company has stepped in as co-debtor in third party’s obligation in the amount of EUR 12,300 thousand

(BGN 24,057 thousand). The management of the company underwent a process of confirmation of the
relevant circumstances, including it has asked the receivers of CCB for provision of information, and as a
result as per the date of the present financial statements no reliable and indisputable evidences were received
for the existence of such contingent liability, nor for its exact amount (if such liability exists). Respectively, no
liability or provision has been recognized as at December 31, 2019, and contingent liability is disclosed. There
are uncertainties related to the outcome of the matter that may have an impact on the value of the recognized
liabilities and affect the profit and loss.

After the reporting period the sole owner of the share capital of BTC took a decision for distribution of
dividend amounting to BGN 82 882 602, representing part of the distributable reserves of the Company as at
31 December 2018 corresponding to the part of the share capital of the Company over which no attachments
are imposed (as disclosed in Note 19)

As a preventive measure against the outburst of COVID-19 (Coronavirus) in Europe, on 13 March 2020 the
Parliament of Republic of Bulgaria adopted a resolution declaring a state of emergency in the territory of
Bulgaria with effect until 13 April 2020, which was subsequently prolonged until 12 May 2020. On the same
day the Minister of Healthcare issued an order suspending all visits in certain commercial establishments such
as restaurants, shopping centres, entertainment and gaming halls, etc. On 23 March 2020 Law on measures
and actions during a state of emergency was adopted, aimed at mitigating the negative consequences of the
epidemic on citizens and businesses. While the core activities of the Group are not directly affected by these
measures, potential negative impact on its financial position might be expected after the reporting period. As
of the date these consolidated and separate financial statements were authorised for issue, no reasonable
estimate of the financial effect of the coronavirus outbreak can be made.

Except as stated above, there are no other events that require adjustments or disclosures in these financial
statements, which have occurred during the period from the reporting date to the date the consolidated and
separate financial statements were authorised for issue by the Managing Board (23.April 2020).

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT**

To the sole shareholder of Bulgarian Telecommunications Company EAD

**REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE SEPARATE AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**Opinion**

We have audited the accompanying separate and consolidated financial statements of Bulgarian
Telecommunications Company EAD (the “Parent Company”) and its subsidiaries (together referred to as
“the Group”), which comprise the separate and consolidated statement of financial position as at
December 31, 2019, and the separate and consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the separate and
consolidated statement of changes in equity and the separate and consolidated statement of cash flows for the
year then ended, and notes to the separate and consolidated financial statements, including a summary of
significant accounting policies.

In our opinion, the accompanying separate and consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2019, and its financial performance and its
cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”),
as adopted by the European Union (“EU”).

**Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities
under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the separate and
consolidated financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with
the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence
Standards) of the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA Code) together with the
ethical requirements of the Independent Financial Audit Act (IFAA) that are relevant to our audit of the
separate and consolidated financial statements in Bulgaria, and we have fulfilled our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code and the requirements of IFAA. We believe that the audit
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

**Emphasis of Matter**

We draw attention to the following notes to the separate and consolidated financial statements, disclosing:

a) Uncertainties related to future outcome of litigations:

   - Note 4c—contingent liabilities related to lawsuits and administrative proceedings,

b) Effects of the initial application of IFRS 16 Leases:

   - Note 2.1 Basis of preparation, Initial application of new amendments to the existing standards effective
for the current reporting period,

Our opinion is not modified in respect of these matters.

**Information Other than the separate and consolidated financial statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon**

The Managing Board (the “Management”) is responsible for the other information. The other information
comprises the annual report on activities, prepared by the management in accordance with Chapter Seven of
the Accountancy Act, but does not include the separate and consolidated financial statements and our
auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the separate and consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and
we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon, unless it is not specifically stated in our auditor’s
report and to the extent it is specifically stated.

In connection with our audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to
read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent
with the separate and consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise
appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a
material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

**Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the separate and consolidated**
**financial statements**

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the separate and consolidated
financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, and for such internal control as
management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of separate and consolidated financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the separate and consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and
using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to
cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee (“Those charged with governance”) are responsible for
overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the separate and consolidated financial
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an
auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when
it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis
of these separate and consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the separate and consolidated financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting
a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the Group’s internal control.


-----

- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
and related disclosures made by management.

- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and,
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions
that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a
material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related
disclosures in the separate and consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to
modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our
auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going
concern.

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the separate and consolidated financial
statements, including the disclosures, and whether the separate and consolidated financial statements
represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business
activities within the Group to express an opinion on the separate and consolidated financial statements.

- We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely
responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control
that we identify during our audit.

**REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS**

**Additional matters, required to be reported by the Accountancy Act**

In addition to our reporting responsibilities according to ISAs described in section “Information Other than
the separate and consolidated financial statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon”, with respect to the annual
report on activities, we have also performed the procedures, together with the required under ISA, in
accordance with the “Guidelines regarding new extended reports and communication by the auditor” of the
Professional Organization of Registered Auditors in Bulgaria—Institute of Certified Public Accountants
(ICPA). These procedures include tests over the existence, form and content of the other information in order
to assist us in forming an opinion as to whether the other information includes the disclosures and reporting
as required by Chapter Seven of the Accountancy Act, applicable in Bulgaria.

**Opinion under Article 37, paragraph 6 of the Accountancy Act**

Based on the procedures performed, in our opinion:

- The information included in the annual report on the activities for the financial year for which the separate
and consolidated financial statements have been prepared, is consistent with the separate and consolidated
financial statements.

- The annual report on the activities has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Chapter
Seven of the Accountancy Act.
