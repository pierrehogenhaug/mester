Our Media Group segment presents results for Nova BG (acquired on January 22, 2021) and Dan Graf (acquired on March 10, 2021) from the respective date of consolidation with the Group’s results for the three months ended March 31, 2021. While we adopted IFRS 16 with effect from January 1, 2019 at the consolidated Group level, we did not give effect to IFRS 16 in our management accounts and therefore at the segment level until January 1, 2021. In this offering memorandum we have adjusted the figures for the year ended December 31, 2020 to reflect this change in accounting policy at the segment level to enhance comparability. As a result, our UG Adjusted EBITDA, UG Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Adjusted Capital Expenditure for our Serbia Group, Slovenia Group, Bosnia Group, Montenegro Group and Media Group for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019 are not comparable with amounts for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the three months ended March 31, 2021. _Capital Expenditure and UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure_ Capital expenditure represents purchases of tangible and intangible assets, consisting primarily of set-top box purchases and other customer capital expenditure, installations (including capitalized labor costs), cable and mobile network build out, upgrades, maintenance and other investments, computer hardware and software. In this offering memorandum, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, we have derived capital expenditure (as recognized under IFRS) for the Company and for each of the Company’s business segments from the Company Audited Financial Statements and, for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2021, from the Company Unaudited Interim Financial Statements. See “Reconciliation of Certain Financial Data _Presented Herein.”_ UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure represents capital expenditure, as adjusted by intragroup adjustments, the application of IFRS 15 for acquisition costs in SBB Serbia, assets held for sale and overflow between periods. ----- Intragroup adjustments relate to unrealized profit on the intragroup sale of end-user equipment by SBB Serbia. When SBB Serbia sells this equipment to other Group companies in compliance with applicable transfer pricing requirements, it makes an unrealized profit on the sale. These unrealized profits are eliminated for the purposes of preparing our accounts in accordance with IFRS, but are not eliminated for the purpose of our management accounts (which are not prepared in accordance with IFRS). The application of IFRS 15 for acquisition costs in SBB Serbia reflects the additional effect of harmonizing our accounting policy with respect to the capitalization of subscriber acquisition costs for rebinding, upselling and cross-selling (which in the past were not eligible to be capitalized, but under IFRS 15 qualify for capitalization), which were determined subsequent to the preparation of our management accounts. Assets held for sale relate to programming rights acquired by our Media Group segment for other Group segments which were recognized under IFRS as intangible assets and were invoiced to other Group segments after March 31, 2021. Overflow between periods relates to the fact that our management accounts are closed prior to the closing of our accounts prepared in accordance with IFRS. Overflow between periods in any given period reflects the additional capital expenditure incurred between the preparation of our management accounts and our accounts prepared in accordance with IFRS for such period. In this offering memorandum, we present UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure for the Company and for each of the Company’s business segments for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, and for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2021. See “Summary of Company and Group Run-Rate, Vivacom, _Unaudited Pro Forma and Certain Other Financial Data” and “Reconciliation of Certain Financial Data Presented Herein.” A reconciliation between the Company’s capital expenditure and UG Adjusted Capital_ Expenditure for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, and the three months ended March 31, 2021 is included elsewhere in this offering memorandum, under “Reconciliation of Certain Financial Data _Presented Herein.” In addition, for informational purposes only, we describe our anticipated UG Adjusted_ Capital Expenditure for the year ended December 31, 2021 based on management estimates, which may vary from our actual Group level capital expenditure data when it is prepared in accordance with IFRS. UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure and our future UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure estimates are prepared based on management accounts rather than IFRS. One example of a difference in methodology used in preparing the management account financial data (as compared to IFRS financial data) is that when determining capital expenditure relating to set-top boxes purchased by our group companies, the expenditure is treated as inventory until such set-top box is activated by the end-user, at which time it is treated as a fixed asset. Under IFRS, however, this expenditure is required to be accounted for as a fixed asset from the moment such set-top box is purchased. As a result, when presenting our segment level UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure and our anticipated UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure for the year ended December 31, 2021 in this offering memorandum, we classify our expenditures relating to set-top boxes as inventory until such set-top boxes are activated by the end-user. PricewaterhouseCoopers d.o.o. Zagreb has not audited, reviewed or performed any procedures with respect to UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure included in this offering memorandum, and, accordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers d.o.o. Zagreb does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on such information. PricewaterhouseCoopers d.o.o. assumes no responsibility for and denies any association with or responsibility for the Company’s calculation of UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure. _Foreign Exchange Rates_ SBB Serbia, Telemach BH, Telemach Croatia and Vivacom and Nova BG historically have reported their results in Serbian dinar, Bosnian marks, Croatian kune and Bulgarian lev, respectively. Where we have presented financial data for each of SBB Serbia, Telemach BH, Telemach Croatia, Vivacom and Nova BG in this offering memorandum, it is presented in euro rather than Serbian dinar, Bosnian marks, Croatian kune or Bulgarian lev, respectively. Where we have presented financial data for Vivacom or Nova BG in a currency other than the euro, it is presented in Bulgarian lev. The exchange rates used for the financial data of SBB Serbia, Telemach BH and Telemach Croatia presented in this offering memorandum are the following average exchange rates for the relevant period, based on the Serbian and Croatian national banks’ daily middle rate exchange rates on working and non-working days during the period indicated below: - Serbian dinar to euro: RSD 118.2752 per €1.00 for the year ended December 31, 2018, which was the average rate during that period; RSD 117.8595 per €1.00 for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was the ----- average rate during that period; RSD 117.5777 per €1.00 for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was the average rate during that period; RSD 117.5677 per €1.00 for the three months ended March 31, 2020, which was the average rate during that period; and RSD 117.5782 per €1.00 for the three months ended March 31, 2021, which was the average rate during that period. - Croatian kuna to euro: HRK 7.5331 per €1.00 for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was the average rate during that period; HRK 7.5377 per €1.00 for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, which was the average rate during that period; HRK 7.4888 per €1.00 for the three months ended March 31, 2020, which was the average rate during that period; and HRK 7.56724 per €1.00 for the three months ended March 31, 2021, which was the average rate during that period. The financial data of Telemach BH and Vivacom and Nova BG (when presented in euros) presented in this offering memorandum use the following exchange rates: - Bosnian mark to euro: BAM 1.9558 per €1.00, which is the rate at which the Bosnian mark is pegged to the euro. - Bulgarian lev to euro: BGN 1.9558 per €1.00, which is the rate at which the Bulgarian lev is pegged to the euro.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Certain financial information of BTC as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 included in this offering memorandum is derived from the unaudited comparative financial information included in the 2020 Vivacom Audited Financial Statements and is presented to reflect restated amounts resulting from the change in the accounting policy related to leases of software, which was implemented in order to align to the treatment and presentation under the accounting policies of Summer Parent S.à r.l. As a result, leased software is presented as “Intangible assets” according to IAS 38—Intangible assets and not as “Right-of-use assets”, by applying IFRS 16—Leases. The corresponding liabilities were reclassified accordingly from “Borrowings and lease liabilities” to “Trade payables”. See Note 2.1.1 to the 2020 Vivacom Audited Financial Statements. The financial information of BTC as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 included in this offering memorandum was not restated to reflect this change in accounting policy given IFRS 16 was adopted as of January 1, 2019 under the modified retrospective approach, and therefore it may not be comparable with the financial information of BTC as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 included in this offering memorandum. The financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 included in this offering memorandum is derived from the unaudited comparative financial information included in the 2019 Vivacom Audited Financial Statements as of and is presented to reflect the (i) restated amounts of net cash from operating activities and net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018, which have been restated due to reclassification of 2018 capitalized costs to fulfil and obtain contracts with customers from operating activities, to properly reflect the investing nature of those costs, in the amount of BGN 32.8 million, (ii) restated amounts of capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2018, which have ----- been restated to be presented on a consistent basis with the calculation performed for the year ended December 31, 2019 and the nine months ended September 30, 2020, and (iii) restated amounts in the statement of comprehensive income due to a reclassification of other operating expenses, with effect from January 1, 2019, the amount of recognized losses for impairment of financial and contract assets is included under the separate line item “Net impairment losses on financial and contract assets.” Additionally, Vivacom has considered the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic as non-adjusting subsequent events and therefore the 2019 Vivacom Audited Financial Statements do not reflect the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. See Note 4 to the 2020 Vivacom Audited Financial Statements. _Adoption of New Accounting Policies_ Vivacom has adopted various accounting policies during the financial periods presented in this offering memorandum. With effect as of January 1, 2019, Vivacom has adopted IFRS 16 (Leases). As permitted under IFRS, Vivacom did not apply a full retrospective approach when adopting these accounting policies and, as a result, has not restated any historical financial data (including the relevant comparative figures) prior to the implementation of the new accounting policies as of the date mentioned above. As a result of these changes in accounting policies, Vivacom’s results and financial position may not be directly comparable from period to period. _Vivacom Segment Reporting_ We also present a discussion of BTC’s revenues, cost of sales and gross margin for its operating segments for the years ended December 31, 2018 (which were derived from the comparative financial information included in the 2019 Vivacom Audited Financial Statements ), 2019 and 2020. Under IFRS 8 “Operating Segments,”BTC presents its segment data in the notes to the 2020 Vivacom Audited Financial Statements and the Vivacom Unaudited Interim Financial Statements. In Note 26 to the Vivacom Audited Financial Statements and Note 25 to the Vivacom Unaudited Interim Financial Statements, BTC reports operating segment results for three operating segments: - Fixed-line of business: this segment includes the results of voice and data services over the fixed network and Pay-TV (both DTH and IPTV); - Mobile line of business: this operating segment includes the results from mobile services (GSM, UMTS and LTE standards); and - NURTS business: this operating segment includes the results from TV and radio broadcasting, collocation services and maintenance of telecom infrastructure arising from BTC’s subsidiary NURTS Bulgaria EAD and its wholly-owned subsidiary NURTS Digital EAD.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

These measures are presented in this offering memorandum because we believe that they and similar measures are widely used in the telecommunications industry as a means of evaluating a company’s operating performance and financing structure. These measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and are not measurements under IFRS or other generally accepted accounting principles, and you should not consider such items as alternatives to net income (loss), ----- operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS, and they may be different from similarly titled measures used by other companies. Our management believe the data for each respective company or group, along with comparable IFRS measures, is useful to investors because it provides a basis for measuring the operating performance in the periods presented. These measures are used in the internal management of our business, along with the most directly comparable IFRS financial measures, in evaluating operating performance. The Non-IFRS Measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for our or a relevant group’s results or any performance measures under IFRS as set forth in our consolidated financial statements or the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements. Some of these limitations are: - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital commitments; - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - they do not reflect the interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; - they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay; - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our consolidated profit and loss statement; - they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; - assets are depreciated or amortized over differing estimated useful lives and often have to be replaced in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and - other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations the Non-IFRS Measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our IFRS results and using these Non-IFRS Measures only supplementally to evaluate our performance.

382_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.1,,"We are the leading cable and media player in Southeastern Europe, providing services to approximately 3.7 million homes as of March 31, 2021. We are the leading distributor of Pay-TV in our core markets of Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and the number two distributor in Montenegro. As of March 31, 2021, we provided services to approximately 10.9 million RGUs and analog and digital cable Pay-TV services to approximately 1.9 million unique subscribers. United Group’s revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was €439.4 million and UG Adjusted EBITDA was €179.2 million. The Group had Run-Rate Revenue for the annualized last two quarters ended March 31, 2021 of €1,976.4 million and Run-Rate Last Two Quarter Annualized Adjusted EBITDA on a pre-IFRS 16 basis for March 31, 2021 was €706.3 million. The Combined Group is the clear multi-play leader in its footprint, with market leading positions in Pay-TV, broadband internet and fixed-line and mobile-telephony in Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Bulgaria, Croatia and, following the Forthnet Acquisition, Greece. The Combined Group’s addressable market comprised 13.4 million households as of December 31, 2020. We have grown rapidly through both acquisitions and organic growth. In July 2020, we acquired Vivacom, the market leading integrated telecommunications operator in Bulgaria, based on total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, which is the leading operator in fixed-line telephony services and broadband services, the number three provider of mobile-telephony services and the number three provider of Pay-TV, in each case, by number of subscribers as of March 31, 2021. The Vivacom Acquisition increased our addressable market by approximately 35% in terms of population, and the addition of Vivacom’s subscriber base more than doubled our existing subscriber base. In March 2020, we also acquired Tele2 Croatia, the third largest telecommunications operator in Croatia, based on mobile revenues as of March 31, 2021, through which we offer mobile services in Croatia. In November 2020, we completed the acquisition of a controlling interest (the “Forthnet Acquisition”) in Forthnet S.A. (“Forthnet”), a prominent telecom operator and Pay-TV provider in Greece, which marked our entry into the Greek market and will strengthen our position as an industry leader in Southeastern Europe. In January 2021, we acquired Bulgaria’s largest multi-platform media company, Nova Broadcasting Group EOOD, from Advance Media Group EAD (the “Nova Broadcasting Group Acquisition”), providing a strong base for our content offering in Bulgaria. In July 2021, we signed an agreement to acquire a majority interest (the “Optima Telekom Acquisition”) in OT-Optima Telekom d.d. (“Optima Telekom”), a Croatian telecom operator offering a broad range of fixed internet and pay-TV services. Subject to its completion, the Optima Telekom Acquisition will allow us to further expand our presence in the Croatian market and offer a full range of telecommunication services, including pay-TV, through our existing infrastructure in the country. We offer a diverse and differentiated line of products and services. We are the leading distributor of satellite (“DTH”) Pay-TV across Southeastern Europe, with Pay-TV product and service offerings in each of Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia and Montenegro, where we use our Total TV platform to serve subscribers both inside and outside of our cable footprint to deliver content across the entire region, including rural areas. Following the Vivacom Acquisition, we also provide Pay-TV services in Bulgaria and are the leading IPTV provider in Bulgaria, while the Nova Broadcasting Group Acquisition strengthened our content offering in Bulgaria. Following the Forthnet Acquisition, we also provide cable and DTH services in Greece. In addition to our cable-based and satellite-based services, we offer mobile-telephony services in Slovenia, Bulgaria and Croatia. We provide 4G LTE coverage to almost the entire population in each of these countries, and we are rolling out 5G networks across our mobile-telephony footprint. On September 21, 2020, we announced the commercial launch of our 5G network in Bulgaria, and to that end in May 2021, we secured a 20-year license for 100 MHz spectrum frequencies in the 3.6 GHz band. We also in April 2021 secured 15-year spectrum licenses in Slovenia for 5G frequencies, and commenced deployment and commercial launch of 5G 3600 MHz in Slovenia in June 2021. We are participating in a 5G spectrum auction in Croatia this year. ----- Our core telecommunications business is also complemented by our two over-the-top (“OTT”) distribution platforms that customers can access through internet based streaming: EON, our regional OTT platform, which enables customers connected to our competitors’ broadband internet connections outside of our cable footprint to access our attractive portfolio of Pay-TV channels, and NetTV Plus, our international OTT platform, which delivers ethnic and local language content to the ex-Yugoslav diaspora around the world. In July 2020, we launched Shoppster, our regional e-commerce online-shopping platform, which offers more than 20 popular product categories, including electronics, home and gardening, tools, fashion, items for children and kitchen appliances. Shoppster is available as an integrated online and TV shopping platform in Serbia and Slovenia. Through our in-house content business, we produce distinctive and attractive in-house media content for our Pay-TV channels across multiple key genres that have historically driven Pay-TV subscriptions. These channels include Southeastern Europe’s most popular family of branded Pay-TV sports channels, as well as popular movie channels, children’s channels, a 24/7 news channel, music channels and other specialized channels, which we continue to expand both organically and through acquisitions. We currently produce over 40% of the total content in our national (terrestrial) and cable operations, and our programs typically receive ratings of between 30% to 60% in the markets in which they are available. The Group also has in-house media and content production in Greece. We believe that our market leading content portfolio differentiates us from our competitors, has enabled strong growth in our business and provides us with predictable third-party carriage fees. As part of our media business, we also provide advertising services and digital production and distribution. Our Nova TV Croatia channel has strong local content production and profitability, with an audience share of 40% and market share by advertising revenue of 50%. Nova BH and Nova M have appealing content, such as popular national team football events until 2022, such as the Euro Cup qualifiers, Euro Cup, World Cup qualifiers and League of Nations. In March 2019, we launched Nova S in Serbia. Nova S is a channel offering high-quality local production series, sports, talk shows with well-known national presenters and high-quality international productions, fully exclusive to SBB, Total TV and EON. The Nova Broadcasting Group Acquisition makes us a major content player in Bulgaria by adding Nova BG’s media platform comprising ten television channels, including NOVA TV, which broadcasts throughout Bulgaria, Bulgaria’s largest online platform, Net Info, which reaches on average 80% of the Bulgarian population each month, and four radio stations. In addition to our own content, as a result of our pan regional presence and well established distribution network, we are a distribution partner of choice for premium regional and international content owners, such as Discovery/Eurosport, Viacom, AXN, CNN, HBO, Fox and Universal, and sports rights owners, such as the English Premier League, Spanish Football League LaLiga, 2020 UEFA European Championship qualifiers, 2020 UEFA European Championship, 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, UEFA League of Nations, ATP, Formula 1, Euroleague, and Moto GP, which we believe allows us to consistently obtain high-quality content and attractive payment terms. Nova BG holds licenses to offer compelling content in Bulgaria through distributors such as CBS Intenrational, the Walt Disney Company, Columbia Pictures and Paramount Pictures, as well as popular sports content such as the English Premier League football, Euro Cup qualifiers and the Euro Cup and Formula One racing. We believe these providers partner with us because of our well-known brands, large network and our focus on Southeastern Europe. We operate most of our business across eight countries in Southeastern Europe: Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Greece. These countries have a combined population of approximately 40 million, distributed across approximately 13.4 million households as of December 31, 2020, and represent the second-largest Central and Eastern European (“CEE”) market after Poland. Despite economic differences, many of these countries share a joint history and form a single market in which small local differences are overshadowed by the influence of similarities in cultural preferences and language across the region and are characterized by growing Pay-TV and broadband markets that are currently underpenetrated relative to some other CEE and Western European markets. We are the leading multi-play provider in Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Bulgaria, where we combine our services into packages, or bundles, which offer subscribers the convenience of being able to purchase television, broadband internet and telephony services from a single provider, and provides us with significant opportunities to cross-sell our products. We believe that we are well-positioned to maintain our market leading positions in the Pay-TV and cable broadband internet markets in Slovenia, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to further increase our market shares, as we differentiate our product offerings through one of the highest download speeds in our ----- broadband markets, access to desirable media content, a well invested network and high-quality customer service, which has led to relatively low churn rates which we believe demonstrate customer loyalty. We also believe that we are well-positioned to continue to grow in our region, and build on our expansion into Bulgaria and Greece. Our customers view the telecommunications products and services that we offer as part of their everyday lives, which results in recurring, high demand for our products and makes our business more resilient to macro-economic disruptions when compared to other discretionary products and services. For example, during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic our products and services have been instrumental in providing connectivity and entertainment, as an increasing number of people began to work or study remotely and spent significant amounts of time at home, which resulted in a significant increase in our voice and data traffic between March and May 2020. In particular, over this period, our fixed data traffic increased at rates between 50% and 70%, while fixed voice traffic increased at rates between 50% and 85%, depending on the country. In addition, our mobile data and voice traffic increased at rates between 30% and 40%, depending on the country. Traffic levels decreased during the summer months and started increasing again as new lockdowns were implemented in various countries. To accommodate such higher customer demand, we increased capacity on network elements and interconnections. In this recurring, high demand environment, we believe we offer superior products, faster broadband speeds and higher quality content than many of our competitors.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933
382_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Competitive Strengths,9.2.1,We are the leading multi-play service provider with a pan regional platform across Southeastern Europe.,"We are the leading multi-play telecommunications and media provider in Southeastern Europe, a position which we have strengthened significantly through the Vivacom Acquisition. Specifically, we are the leading provider of Pay-TV in our three core markets of Slovenia, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the leading provider of broadband in Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, in each case, based on market share by number of subscribers. We are also the leading provider of broadband and the number three provider of Pay-TV in Bulgaria based on market share by number of subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2020, and the second-largest Pay-TV operator in Greece. In addition to our cable-based and satellite-based services, we offer mobile-telephony services in Slovenia, in Bulgaria and in Croatia. The acquisitions we have made have delivered significant geographic expansion and diversification of our business into Bulgaria and Greece. The Vivacom Acquisition, for example, increased our addressable market by 35% in terms of population, and doubled our existing customer base. Furthermore, our scale and presence across Southeastern Europe and across our product portfolios allows us to cross-sell our services and expand the number of multi-play packages we provide, creating opportunities to expand our customer base.

We operate an advanced proprietary hybrid fiber coaxial (“HFC”) network which is fully bi-directional and EuroDOCSIS 3.0 enabled, covering all of our homes passed in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro, and approximately 98% of homes passed in our HFC network in Slovenia as of November 1, 2020 are fully bi-directional. We operate the largest fiber network in the region, comprised of 8,966 kilometers of backbone and extending 10,119 kilometers across metropolitan regions in Slovenia (approximately 3,506 kilometers), Serbia (approximately 4,907 kilometers), Bosnia and Herzegovina (approximately 1,080 kilometers) and Montenegro (approximately 626 kilometers). We also operate one of the largest fiber networks in Bulgaria, with 1.7 million (or 58%) of households in the country covered and a fully owned fiber connecting to major points of presence across Europe. As of March 31, 2021, 91% of our core network was DOCSIS 3.1 ready. With the addition of Vivacom’s cable network, our cable network covers approximately 3.7 million homes passed, as of March 31, 2021. Our network has an average homes passed per fiber optics node ratio in the range of approximately 274, 213 and 234 across Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, respectively, which we believe is unrivalled in Southeastern Europe and compares favorably to other European cable operators, which average 562 homes passed per node on the basis of comparable peers operating in UK, Sweden, Spain, Germany and Belgium. We believe that our cable TV infrastructure allows us to provide higher quality digital TV, high-speed broadband and fixed-line telephony than other cable operators in our markets. Our EuroDOCSIS 3.0 network allows us to compete effectively in Slovenia, where fiber to the home (“FttH”) constituted approximately 44% of the broadband market share as of December 31, 2020. We can match FttH speeds in overlapping markets and have a service speed advantage in non-FttH areas. In Serbia, our broadband internet speed gives us an advantage over most of our broadband internet competitors, and we provide broadband speeds of 75-1000 Mbps for the majority of our subscribers in Serbia. We also provide internet download speeds which we believe compare favorably to the national average in Serbia with our average recorded download speed being 1.8x faster than that of one of our main competitors. Additionally, we also believe that we provide superior internet download speeds in Slovenia with our average recorded download speed being 2.9x faster than that ----- of one of our main competitors (which the competitor is only able to offer in certain geographic areas). In Bosnia and Herzegovina, we are well-positioned to compete with incumbents that primarily use DSL, as well as with smaller regional cable operators. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, we believe that our average recorded download speed is 4.5x faster than that of one our main competitors. In Montenegro, we have developed FttH Gigabit capable Passive Optical Networks (“GPON”) with over 25,438 homes passed and over 5,742 homes connected to this network. Following the Vivacom Acquisition, we operate the largest fiber network in Bulgaria, providing VDSL with speeds of more than 70 Mbps for more than 50% of our network and more than 50 Mbps for 74% of our network, with full redundancy capability and high service reliability. Our mobile network covers the majority of Slovenia’s population through our extensive 2G/3G/4G networks, and at present we have the capability to provide 4G (LTE) and 4G+ (LTE-A) coverage to approximately 99% and 98%, respectively, of the Slovenian population. We are also the third largest mobile operator in Bulgaria by market share, with approximately three million subscribers as of March 31, 2021, and provide LTE mobile network coverage to 99.94% of the Bulgarian population. We believe Vivacom’s mobile strategy, which includes attractive tariff plans, flexible service bundles, integrated IT systems and the fastest 4G/LTE mobile network in Europe, has allowed it to differentiate itself from competitors and consistently gain market share in recent years. In addition, we are the third largest telecommunications operator in Croatia based on mobile revenues as of March 31, 2021, with a highly competitive 4G service, a signal covering all major cities and important roads in Croatia and a growing customer base of nearly one million as of March 31, 2021. To further develop our networks, we have successfully tested and are rolling out next generation 5G networks across our mobile-telephony footprint. On September 21, 2020, we announced the commercial launch of our 5G network in Bulgaria, and to that end in May 2021, we secured a 20-year license for 100 MHz spectrum frequencies in the 3.6 GHz band. We also in April 2021 secured 15-year spectrum licenses in Slovenia for 5G frequencies, and commenced deployment and commercial launch of 5G 3600 MHz in Slovenia in June 2021. We are participating in a 5G spectrum auction in Croatia this year. We believe that our cable network is well invested and benefits from low maintenance UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure requirements. We believe that this will allow us to manage our UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure in the near to medium term, with expenditures largely being success and capacity based as our business expands, while making targeted improvements to our network. We believe that Vivacom has a similarly well invested network and profile. UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure was €91.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, and we estimate that UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure for the year ended December 31, 2021 will be between €371 million and €373 million (excluding mobile frequencies and any amounts for Forthnet, Nova BG or Optima Telekom ).

We operate most of our business across the following eight countries in Southeastern Europe: Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, North Macedonia and Montenegro. These countries are characterized by growing Pay-TV and broadband markets that are currently underpenetrated relative to some other CEE and Western European markets. Following the Forthnet Acquisition we also operate in Greece. As of March 31, 2021, in Slovenia, our Pay-TV penetration of homes passed and broadband internet penetration were 61% and 89%, respectively; in Serbia, Pay-TV penetration and broadband internet penetration were 65% and 73%, respectively; and in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Pay-TV penetration and broadband internet penetration were 61% and 81%, respectively. Additionally, due to historically strong regulatory constraints on bundling Pay-TV, broadband internet and telephony services, RGUs per cable subscriber in our key markets in Serbia, Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina have lagged behind CEE and Western European cable markets. Markets in Bulgaria have similar characteristics. Our cable RGUs per subscriber ratios of 2.3x for Serbia, 2.7x for Slovenia and 2.3x for Bosnia and Herzegovina, in each case as of March 31, 2021, demonstrate that there are strong opportunities to continue to utilize up selling and cross-selling opportunities to grow our cable RGUs per subscriber ratio in Slovenia. ----- The following table shows comparisons of RGUs per cable subscriber in certain key CEE and Western European markets with those of certain other industry members: Source: Public company filings. As of March 31, 2021, for United Group, Telenet and Euskaltel and as of June 30, 2018 for the other industry peers. The methodologies used to calculate and report RGUs and RGUs per cable subscriber by certain other industry members may vary. At the same time, Pay-TV penetration in all of our markets has been growing, driven by increasingly attractive content and bundled offers. Service penetration in our markets has increased as multi-play packages have expanded but is still below the levels of some Western European cable markets (except in Slovenia). Leveraging our extensive cable infrastructure, we use our high-quality Pay-TV content as a basis to cross and up sell our broadband internet and telephony products to existing cable Pay-TV customers and offer multi-play packages to new customers, which we expect will allow us to continue to improve penetration rates as customers increasingly focus on the convenience of receiving their multimedia and communications services in a bundled offer from one provider. For example, while penetration rates in Slovenia are more comparable to those of Western European operators, a substantial number of our subscribers in Slovenia are subscribed to a single service, which we believe offers significant cross-selling opportunities. Our number of quad-play subscribers in Slovenia has grown since we began offering mobile services in late 2012 as an MVNO, and, since the acquisition of Tušmobil in April 2015, we have increased the number of quad-play subscribers in Slovenia, from 1% in April 2015 to 38% as of March 31, 2021. In addition to organic growth, we have made targeted and value accretive investments and acquisitions of attractive cable and mobile assets, and we have been successful at integrating these acquisitions and realizing synergies related to a number of these acquisitions, providing lessons learned and significant know-how for integrating Vivacom, Forthnet, Nova BG and Tele2 Croatia. For example, our acquisition of Telemach Slovenia from Liberty Global in 2009, a foray into a new market with a different language and culture, proved to be a successful cross border acquisition story. Within a decade, we tripled blended cable ARPU of Telemach Slovenia (from €13 in 2008, to €35 in 2018) and adjusted EBITDA (from €24 million in 2008, to €71 million in 2018), while revenue grew from €46 million in 2008 to €1.2 billion in the year ended December 31, 2020. This was achieved through both organic growth and the acquisition of Tušmobil in April 2015 which provided us with an opportunity to create a fully convergent cable, internet, fixed-line and mobile-telephony operator in Slovenia, and allowed Slovenian customers to benefit from a convenient bundled product offering consisting of cable Pay-TV, internet, fixed-line and mobile-telephony services from a single provider. We have a strong track record of profitable growth, underpinned by low penetration rates in the markets in which we operate and cross-selling opportunities due to our scale, as well as a record of successfully integrating acquisitions.

As of March 31, 2021, for United Group, Telenet and Euskaltel and as of June 30, 2018 for the other industry peers. The methodologies used to calculate and report RGUs and RGUs per cable subscriber by certain other industry members may vary. At the same time, Pay-TV penetration in all of our markets has been growing, driven by increasingly attractive content and bundled offers. Service penetration in our markets has increased as multi-play packages have expanded but is still below the levels of some Western European cable markets (except in Slovenia). Leveraging our extensive cable infrastructure, we use our high-quality Pay-TV content as a basis to cross and up sell our broadband internet and telephony products to existing cable Pay-TV customers and offer multi-play packages to new customers, which we expect will allow us to continue to improve penetration rates as customers increasingly focus on the convenience of receiving their multimedia and communications services in a bundled offer from one provider. For example, while penetration rates in Slovenia are more comparable to those of Western European operators, a substantial number of our subscribers in Slovenia are subscribed to a single service, which we believe offers significant cross-selling opportunities. Our number of quad-play subscribers in Slovenia has grown since we began offering mobile services in late 2012 as an MVNO, and, since the acquisition of Tušmobil in April 2015, we have increased the number of quad-play subscribers in Slovenia, from 1% in April 2015 to 38% as of March 31, 2021. In addition to organic growth, we have made targeted and value accretive investments and acquisitions of attractive cable and mobile assets, and we have been successful at integrating these acquisitions and realizing synergies related to a number of these acquisitions, providing lessons learned and significant know-how for integrating Vivacom, Forthnet, Nova BG and Tele2 Croatia. For example, our acquisition of Telemach Slovenia from Liberty Global in 2009, a foray into a new market with a different language and culture, proved to be a successful cross border acquisition story. Within a decade, we tripled blended cable ARPU of Telemach Slovenia (from €13 in 2008, to €35 in 2018) and adjusted EBITDA (from €24 million in 2008, to €71 million in 2018), while revenue grew from €46 million in 2008 to €1.2 billion in the year ended December 31, 2020. This was achieved through both organic growth and the acquisition of Tušmobil in April 2015 which provided us with an opportunity to create a fully convergent cable, internet, fixed-line and mobile-telephony operator in Slovenia, and allowed Slovenian customers to benefit from a convenient bundled product offering consisting of cable Pay-TV, internet, fixed-line and mobile-telephony services from a single provider.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Our customers view the telecommunications products and services that we offer as part of their everyday lives, which results in recurring, high demand for our products and makes our business more resilient to macro-economic disruptions when compared to other discretionary products and services. For example, during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic our products and services have been instrumental in providing connectivity and entertainment, as an increasing number of people began to work or study remotely and spend significant amounts of time at home, which resulted in a significant increase in our voice and data traffic between March and May 2020. In particular, over this period, our fixed data traffic increased at rates between 50% and 70%, while fixed voice traffic increased at rates between 50% and 85%, depending on the country. In addition, our mobile data and voice traffic increased at rates between 30% and 40%, depending on the country. To accommodate such higher customer demand, we increased capacity on network elements and interconnections. In this recurring, high demand environment, we believe we offer superior products, faster broadband speeds and higher quality content than our competitors. Customer loyalty is evidenced by our relatively low historical churn rates. Churn rate is defined as the percentage of customers that no longer subscribe for a certain service compared to the average number of customers in a particular month. Churn rates for a period of one year or longer are an average of the monthly average churn rate. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, our unique cable subscriber churn rate annualized was 10%, which is below recent reported cable subscriber churn rates of certain Western European peers. We believe our relatively low churn rates provide, among other benefits, recurring cash flows and visibility with respect to future revenue. Moreover, these churn rates have persisted notwithstanding regular price increases. From 2017, our Blended Cable ARPU excluding Vivacom has grown from €20.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 to €23.2 for the three months ended March 31, 2021, representing a CAGR of 3.6%. Average triple play monthly fees have also increased across geographies, from €28 in 2013 to €33 for legacy packages (21% of triple play base) and €34 for current EON packages (78% of triple play base) in Serbia, from €41 in 2015 to €46 for legacy packages (28% of triple play base) and €48 for current EON packages (72% of triple play base) in Slovenia, and from €27 in 2013 to €31 for legacy packages (21% of triple play base) and €32 for current EON packages (78% of triple play base) in Bosnia and Herzegovina, each for the three months ended March 31, 2021. In addition, Vivacom’s declining churn rates, together with our experience in driving customer loyalty, present significant upside potential. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, Vivacom’s mobile subscriber churn rate was 18% annualized compared to 25% for the year ended December 31, 2017, and its IPTV subscriber churn rate was 11% annualized compared to 15% for the year ended December 31, 2017. ----- ability to up sell and cross-sell products.

The revenue streams most negatively affected include advertising, media selling and mobile handsets sales. Following the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020, we implemented cost optimization initiatives and managed our capital expenditure plans in response to the pandemic, but we did so in a way that would not hinder our ability for future growth and quality of services provided. Our telecommunications segments have continued to meet customers’ expectations on service level and our network operating centers have maintained normal service levels. Based on this, no significant change in our customer base occurred. As customers were unlikely or unable to easily migrate during the crisis, in 2020 we experienced somewhat lower gross adds and churn rates, with our operations normalizing during 2021. Organic revenues and UG Adjusted EBITDA in our telecommunications segment remained stable during 2020 compared to the previous year. ----- During the first waves of lockdowns imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic between March and May 2020, as an increasing number of people began to work or study remotely and spend significant amounts of time at home, we saw a significant increase in our voice and data traffic. In particular, over this period, our fixed data traffic increased at rates between 50% and 70%, while fixed voice traffic increased at rates between 50% and 85%, depending on the country. In addition, our mobile data and voice traffic increased at rates between 30% and 40%, depending on the country. To accommodate such higher customer demand, we increased capacity on network elements and interconnections. In our Media segment, we estimate that organic revenue in the segment declined by approximately 5-6% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the previous year. This decline was due in part to the postponement of certain sporting events and a decline in advertising revenue, partially offset by a decline in relevant costs. Overall, supported by cost optimization efforts, UG Adjusted EBITDA in the Media segment remained broadly stable year on year prior to giving effect to the Nova Broadcasting Group Acquisition. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, we have seen levels of organic advertising increasing and surpassing pre-COVID levels. Throughout the pandemic, we have continued to grow the Group through acquisitions, completing the acquisitions of Tele2 Croatia (completed in March 2020), Vivacom (completed in July 2020), Forthnet (completed in November 2020) and Nova BG (completed in January 2021). The impact of COVID-19 on these acquired companies is similar to that of the Group’s existing telecommunications operations.

Optima Telekom offers a broad range of fixed broadband internet services to approximately 117 thousand subscribers and pay-TV services to approximately 57 thousand subscribers in Croatia. Completion of the Optima Telekom Acquisition is expected for the end of 2021 and is subject to customary conditions as well as the implementation of certain changes in the current Croatian telecommunication legislation relating to vertical integration between pay-TV broadcasters and distributors, and thus there can be no assurance that the acquisition will be completed by such expected date or at all. Once completed, the acquisition of Optima Telekomwill allow us to further expand our presence in the Croatian market enabling Telemach Croatia to offer a full range of telecommunication services, including pay-TV, through its existing infrastructure.

Estimated revenue of United Group increased compared to the prior-year period due to the significant impacts of the Vivacom Acquisition, the Forthnet Acquisition and the Nova Broadcasting Group Acquisition, none of which were included in such prior-year period.

382_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1122,PRO-FORMA MAR 2021,1122.11,History,1122.11.1,,"Our founder and group executive chairman, Dragan Šolak, founded the company as a Serbian cable TV operator in 2000. Between 2001 and 2005, we grew our business by constructing an advanced cable network throughout Serbia. We also consolidated several sub-scale family owned cable operators and successfully integrated them into our business. We launched our DTH services, Total TV, in Serbia in 2006 and in Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro in 2007 and expanded Total TV into Croatia in 2008 (divested in 2018) and North Macedonia in 2009. In 2007, we entered into a strategic alliance with Sport Klub, and we acquired a controlling stake in the Ultra family of Pay-TV channels in 2009. As a result of our strategic alliances, as well as the acquisition of local language television channels, we were among the first pay-TV providers in Southeastern Europe to provide localized regional and international content. In 2009, we acquired Telemach Slovenia, a leading triple-play provider in Slovenia, adding 160 thousand subscribers to our operations. During 2010, our consolidation of three cable pay-TV operators in Sarajevo, including KT Global Net, BH Cabel Net and ELOB, led to the formation of Telemach BH. In addition, over recent years we have amassed a comprehensive portfolio of owned pay-TV channels, covering sports, movies, news, music, general entertainment and children’s programming, through our United Media business, which we have grown through focused and consistent investment. We continue to leverage our position as the sole credible consolidator in the fragmented regional markets and have successfully acquired and integrated a number of businesses since 2010, including Maxtel in 2016, a local B2B internet provider in Slovenia, and Ikom in 2017, a cable operator in Serbia. In addition, following the acquisition of M kabl in 2016, a cable operator in Montenegro, we have further expanded our subscriber base in Montenegro. Following the liberalization of the fixed-line telephone markets in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia in 2011 and 2012, respectively, we launched fixed-line telephony services in these two markets and, leveraging our existing cable pay-TV and broadband internet subscriber base, became the second-largest Serbian fixedline telephone services provider in June 2013. We also launched our MVNO services in Slovenia in late 2012 and became an MNO upon our acquisition of Tušmobil in 2015, which allowed us to provide quad-play ----- bundles (cable pay-TV, broadband internet, and fixed-line telephony and mobile-telephony services) to our subscribers in Slovenia, in addition to stand-alone mobile-telephony services. In July 2018, we acquired Nova TV d.d. from CME B.V. We believe this acquisition, which included several popular television channels in Croatia, is helping us create a strong mainstream media platform, which further differentiates our distribution platform, promotes our pay-TV channel portfolio, drives continued growth and creates a strong platform for additional bolt on, accretive acquisitions. In September 2018, we acquired Direct Media, a leading media buying agency in Serbia, which included Direct Media’s operations in Serbia, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Albania, as well as our terrestrial TV stations Pink BiH and Pink Montenegro, which have been rebranded Nova BH and Nova M, respectively. On March 3, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Tele2 Croatia, the third largest telecommunications operator in Croatia based on mobile revenues as of September 30, 2020. Tele2 Croatia seeks to offer the best value proposition in the Croatian mobile market, for example, through its offering of unlimited mobile services. Now trading as Telemach Croatia, the acquisition has enabled us to accelerate our growth and further diversify our operations. On July 31, 2020, we completed our acquisition of Vivacom, the market leading integrated telecommunications operator in Bulgaria (based on revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020) which offers both fixed and mobile telecommunications services, as well as broadcasting and satellite services, with a market share of 30% in Bulgaria by revenue as of December 31, 2019, according to the CRC. Expansion in Bulgaria increased our addressable market by approximately 35% in terms of population, and the addition of Vivacom’s subscriber base more than doubled our existing subscriber base. Vivacom’s size, including approximately three million mobile subscribers, 514 thousand fixed-telephony subscribers, 4 64 thousand fixed broadband subscribers and 489 thousand pay-TV subscribers, provides us with significant additional scale, compounding our existing leadership. We believe that the acquisition of Vivacom provides us with greater scale and increases business diversification, expands our reach, cements our position as the industry leader in Southeastern Europe and continues our growth. In September 2020, we completed the acquisition of a significant minority interest in Forthnet S.A., a prominent telecom operator and Pay-TV provider in Greece, and in November 2020, we acquired a controlling interest in Forthnet. Forthnet provides home entertainment and communications services to nearly 1.4 million RGUs. This marked our entry into the Greek market and strengthens our position as an industry leader in Southeastern Europe. Forthnet is the second-largest Pay-TV operator in Greece. The Forthnet Acquisition enables us to accelerate our growth and further diversify our Group In January 2021, we acquired Bulgaria’s largest multi-platform media company, Nova Broadcasting Group EOOD, providing a strong base for our content offering in Bulgaria. In July 2021, we signed an agreement to acquire a majority interest in Croatian telecommunication operator Optima Telekom. Optima Telekom offers a broad range of fixed broadband internet services to approximately 117 thousand subscribers and pay-TV services to approximately 57 thousand subscribers in Croatia.

As of March 31, 2021, 100% of our cable pay-TV customers are subscribed to digital TV. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, Telemach Slovenia’s cable pay-TV services generated revenues of €12.2 million and an ARPU of €18.0. _SBB Serbia_ Our pay-TV penetration in Serbia was 65% as of March 31, 2021, and our number of cable pay-TV subscribers in Serbia was 736 thousand as of March 31, 2021.

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, SBB Serbia’s cable pay-TV services generated revenues of €23.7 million and an ARPU of €10.5. _Telemach BH_ Our pay-TV penetration in Bosnia and Herzegovina was 61% as of March 31, 2021.

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, Vivacom’s cable pay-TV services generated revenues of €7.8 million, representing 24% of its fixed-line revenue for the same period. _Direct to Home Pay-TV_ Our DTH, or satellite, pay-TV service, known as Total TV, is targeted at households outside our cable footprint across Southeastern Europe. Since January 2018 we have not offered pay-TV services in Croatia, due to the divestiture of our Total TV operations in Croatia in connection with the Nova TV Croatia Acquisition. Following the acquisition of Forthnet, United Group also offers DTH pay-TV across Greece to approximately 313 thousand subscribers. Total TV provides subscribers with access to up to 122 channels in Serbia, 53 of which are also available in HD format, 126 channels in Slovenia, 49 of which are also available in HD format, and 129 channels in Bosnia and Herzegovina, 48 of which are also available in HD format. In Bulgaria, Vivacom offers DTH pay-TV with over 160 channels, 20 of which are in HD, as well as multi-feed with over 200 additional channels. In Greece, Forthnet offers DTH pay-TV under the Nova Sports, Nova Cinema and Nova Go brands, with 75 channels, 47 of which are in HD. As we only actively market our DTH offering in those areas that are outside our cable footprint, there is limited to no overlap with analog and digital cable Pay-TV offering. Additionally, there is a low risk of cable pay-TV cannibalization, due to the fact that, for a similar price as basic DTH pay-TV services, our basic cable pay-TV services offer a better value. As with our analog and digital cable pay-TV offering, customers can choose from a range of DTH packages across different price points. Additionally, we have entered into partnership agreements with Telekom Slovenije in Slovenia and Telekom Srbija in Serbia pursuant to which we offer DTH pay-TV content and re sell their respective ADSL internet services to customers outside of our cable footprint. As of March 31, 2021, we provided our Total TV services to approximately 992 thousand subscribers throughout Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Greece, North Macedonia and Montenegro. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, our DTH Pay-TV business segment generated revenues of €37.2 million and an ARPU of €12.4. _OTT Television_ Our two OTT content platforms: our regional OTT platform (previously branded as D3i, now operating under the EON brand) and our international OTT platform (NetTV Plus), have enabled us to further expand our reach: - Regional OTT. Our EON regional OTT platform enables customers of our broadband internet competitors within Serbia and Slovenia (but outside of our cable footprint) to access our distinctive digital content via the internet. Unlike our DTH pay-TV platform, which aims to deliver content to subscribers in rural areas without cable infrastructure, our regional OTT platform delivers pay-TV services to customers in metropolitan areas. By expanding our reach beyond the traditional cable footprint using a regional OTT platform, we are able to increase the number of subscribers to our pay-TV content. ----- - International OTT. Our NetTV Plus platform, which we launched in 2013, provides over 300 channels in SD, 73 channels in HD and 265 radio channels, of which more than 250 local language TV channels showing ethnic content, including all national free-to-air channel offering, to the entire Yugoslav diaspora (estimated at over 4 million people) around the world through the internet. As of December 31, 2020, we had 106 thousand NetTV Plus subscribers. Subscribers can access our NetTV Plus content through their TVs using a set-top box connected to the internet, “Smart TVs” that have built in internet functionality or by streaming content via internet enabled tablets, mobile devices and personal computers. By expanding our geographic reach outside our region to customers in affluent countries in Western Europe and North America, we are positioned to charge prices that are higher than the prices we are able to charge for our pay-TV services in our other markets in Southeastern Europe. - Forthnet OTT. Our own OTT content platform, which operates under the NOVA brand of products and services, Novago, Novaflix, Nova on Demand. Our regional OTT platform offers our customers within the region access to their digital Pay-TV channel offering. As a result, our NOVA subscribers can watch our digital Pay-TV channels on their TV screens, computers, tablets and mobile devices.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Beginning in 2009, we upgraded our network to EuroDOCSIS 3.0, and our network is fully EuroDOCSIS 3.0 enabled. Our network offers our customers up to 1.6 Gbps download speeds. We believe that EuroDOCSIS 3.0 is superior to DSL and on par with the FttH services offered by our competitors. We currently provide internet download speeds that we believe compare favorably to the national average with our average recorded speeds being faster than that of the respective local incumbent by a factor of 2.7x in Slovenia, 1.5x in Serbia and 2.9x in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as of April 16, 2021. As our broadband internet operations provide us with very attractive margins due to little additional cost, we leverage our attractive pay-TV offering to sell broadband internet services to existing pay-TV customers. As a result, we do not sell our broadband internet services on a stand-alone basis and customers wishing to receive our broadband internet services must, at a minimum, subscribe to our analog Basic TV package. As of March 31, 2021, we provided our broadband internet service to approximately 1,396 thousand subscribers across Telemach Slovenia, SBB Serbia, Telemach BH, Vivacom Bulgaria and Telemach MNE. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, our broadband internet business generated revenues of €73.9 million and an ARPU of €9.6.

Following completion of the Optima Telekom Acquisition, we will offer boardband internet services to approximately 117 thousand subscribers in Croatia. _Telemach Slovenia_ Within Slovenia, in a large portion of our cable footprint, our competitors offer DSL services offered by competitors, and not fiber, enabling us to provide the fastest broadband speed available within those areas. Our EuroDOCSIS 3.0 enabled network allows us to compete effectively in the remainder of our cable footprint, which is covered by our competitors’FttH network as it can match speeds offered by FttH operators in these overbuilt areas. We only offer broadband in Slovenia as part of a double, triple, or quad-play package with our cable pay-TV subscriptions. We offer our subscribers several for broadband internet service options, varying in price according to download capacity and speed, and range from a minimum download speed of 50 Mbps to a maximum speed of up to 1,000 Mbps.

In 2018, cable-based broadband accounted for 29% of the broadband services in Slovenia based on number of households, while FttH, DSL and others (which primarily includes wireless, Ethernet, LAD and fixed wireless access) accounted for 71%. As of December 31, 2020, our total broadband market share in Slovenia ----- was 31%. Our fixed broadband penetration in Slovenia was 54% as of December 31, 2020 (estimated). As of December 31, 2020, 96% of our customers in Slovenia received broadband speeds greater than 70 Mbps. _SBB Serbia_ We are the leading cable broadband internet provider in Serbia with our network, passing approximately 1,137 thousand households across the country as of March 31, 2021. Within Serbia, our subscribers benefit from our extensive fully two way enabled and EuroDOCSIS 3.0 upgraded network, with our current maximum commercial offering speed of 1,024/50 Mbps. As of December 31, 2020, the minimum broadband delivery speed we offer to new customers is 75 Mbps. We believe this compares favorably to the minimum broadband internet delivery speed offered by our competitors in Serbia. We offer broadband in Serbia to our existing TV customers and increasingly as part of a multi-play package with our cable Pay-TV. We offer customers several options of broadband internet services varying in download capacity and speed at various price points.

In 2018, cable-based broadband accounted for 44% of the broadband services in Serbia based on number of households, while FttH, DSL and others (which primarily includes wireless, Ethernet, LAD and fixed wireless access) accounted for 56%. As of December 31, 2020, our total broadband market share in Serbia was 32%. Our fixed broadband penetration in Serbia was 47% as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, 86% of our customers in Serbia received broadband speeds greater than 50 Mbps. _Telemach BH_ Within Bosnia and Herzegovina, our subscribers benefit from our fully two way enabled and EuroDOCSIS 3.0 upgraded network which extends approximately 4,591 kilometers across the country and allows network broadband internet speeds of up to 400/15 Mbps. We offer broadband in Bosnia and Herzegovina to our existing TV customers primarily as part of a multiplay package bundled with our digital cable pay-TV. Alternatively, we offer customers several tiers of broadband internet services with our analog TV service. These internet services are available with various download capacities and speeds and at varying price points. Higher broadband internet speeds are available when our internet services are purchased as part of a bundle with our digital pay-TV as compared to the internet services offered as a bundle with our analog pay-TV. As of March 31, 2021, we provided broadband internet to approximately 169 thousand subscribers.

In 2018, cable-based broadband accounted for 33% of the broadband services in Bosnia and Herzegovina based on number of households, while FttH, DSL and others (which primarily includes wireless, Ethernet, LAD and fixed wireless access) accounted for 67%. As of December 31, 2020, our total broadband market share in Bosnia and Herzegovina as of December 31, 2019 was 22%. Our fixed broadband penetration in Bosnia and Herzegovina was 49% as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, 85% of our customers in Bosnia and Herzegovina received broadband speeds higher than 30 Mbps. While Bosnia and Herzegovina is generally not yet making use of high-speed broadband higher than or equal to 30 Mbps, we believe Bosnia and Herzegovina displays clear trends of acceleration. ----- _Telemach MNE_ Within Montenegro, our subscribers benefit from a fully two way enabled and EuroDOCSIS 3.0 upgraded network. We offer cable broadband internet in Montenegro to our existing TV customers primarily as part of a multi-play package with our digital cable pay-TV. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, Telemach MNE’s broadband internet business generated revenues of €0.6 million and an ARPU of €8.3. _Vivacom_ Vivacom provides an array of fixed broadband services over ADSL, VDSL and FTTx connections to both residential and business customers in Bulgaria as well as other data services such as the sale of CPEs, VPN and MAN services and associated complex solutions. All of Vivacom’s offerings include a variety of tariff plans to suit each subscriber’s usage levels. Vivacom has focused on the build out of its fiber network in targeted areas, the retention of its current ADSL subscriber base and migration to VDSL and FTTx and seeks to provide customers with comprehensive after sales services. Vivacom began its FTTx roll out in 2011 in Sofia and Varna and has since achieved significant progress, with 1,292 thousand fiber homes passed as of March 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2020, United Group’s total broadband market share in Bulgaria was 25%. Vivacom maintains a disciplined approach to expanding its fiber network in carefully selected areas and adhering to stringent project acceptance criteria. Vivacom believes its low build out costs are attributable to its ownership of the telecom ducts and the low-cost of labor in Bulgaria, allowing for an attractive return on investments in fiber. In addition, Vivacom bundles fixed-telephony and fixed broadband services, as its fixed broadband plan requires a fixed-telephony subscription and includes a free Wi Fi modem. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, Vivacom’s fixed broadband services generated revenues of €14.2 million and an ARPU of €5.2.

Accordingly, other than in Bulgaria, our fixed-line telephony services are only available to our existing cable pay-TV customers. Through Forthnet, United Group also offers out-of-footprint telephony services (telephony provided through a third-party network) across Greece.

Since we had 191 thousand subscribers for Telemach Slovenia, 442 thousand subscribers for SBB Serbia and 105 thousand subscribers for Telemach BH, each as of March 31, 2021, we believe there is significant growth potential in such broadband markets. In Bulgaria, the total fixed-line telephony market in 2019 was estimated at 868 thousand subscribers (compared to 514 thousand subscribers for Vivacom as of March 31, 2021).

As a result of consistent growth, as of December 31, 2020, we hold a 24% market share in the Slovenian mobile market (as compared to 14% at the end of 2015) and cross-sell mobile services to more than 50% of our fixed-telephony subscriber base.

In 2006, we acquired Sport Klub, the most popular sports channels in the region, and in 2012, we added Cinemania, a popular movie channel, to our content portfolio. We strive to continually improve these offerings. For example, in collaboration with notable studios in the United States, we have improved Cinemania’s movie content helping to establish Cinemania as a leading movie channel in the region. We have also continued to improve the content we offer through our leading Sport Klub channel by adding popular sporting events to its content portfolio. We have introduced localized feeds for Sport Klub channels, in both HD and SD. Furthermore, we organize and produce eSports events, which we broadcasts via Fortuna eSports. In April 2017, we acquired Fight Channel, a Croatian channel with premium content focused on Ultimate Fighting Championship, and IDJ Digital Holding Limited, a digital distributor of music and online video content in Malta.

In March 2021, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 49% of Grand Production. We have also been successful in broadening the distribution reach of our other pay-TV channels. For example, during 2015, we sold distribution rights for N1 and certain Grand Production channels to other major cable operators in the region. We have extended the distribution scope for Orlando Kids and Bambino (which have been rebranded as Pikaboo and Vavoom, respectively), popular channels geared towards children that complement our Ultra family of pay-TV channels, to include Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia, as well as Croatia and Slovenia, where those offerings were already present. We have also increased revenues from our Sport Klub channels by successfully extending our existing contracts with third-party pay-TV distributors while maintaining access to premium content. We have also extended the production of the most popular entertainment shows for national TV stations in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and North Macedonia, such as Your Face Sounds Familiar, Grand Stars, Never too Late and Practical Woman, which became among the most watched shows in their respective markets. In July 2018, we acquired Nova Croatia that features several popular television channels in Croatia. We believe this acquisition will help us to create a strong mainstream media platform that will further differentiate our distribution platform, promote our pay-TV channel portfolio, drive continued growth and create a strong platform for additional bolt-on, accretive acquisitions. In September 2018, we acquired Direct Media, a leading media-buying agency in Serbia, enabling us to deliver targeted solutions to advertisers, for both television (national and pay-TV) and digital, product placements and sponsorships. The transaction included Direct Media’s operations in Serbia, Montenegro, North Macedonia (formerly Macedonia) and Albania, as well as the company’s terrestrial TV stations Pink BiH and Pink Montenegro. In October 2018, we rebranded these channels as Nova BH and Nova M, respectively, to facilitate synergies with the existing brand equity of Nova in Croatia. In March 2019, we launched Nova S in Serbia, a channel fully exclusive to our SBB Serbia, Total TV and EON platforms. Nova S offers high-quality, locally produced series as well as sports and talk shows. Recently, we have significantly increased viewership in most of our channels, particularly Nova S, which has become one of the most popular TV channels in Serbia. In January 2021, we acquired Nova Broadcasting Group, Bulgaria’s largest multi-platform media company, which operates 10 television channels, including Nova TV, and Bulgaria’s largest online platform. Forthnet also produces its own media and content for the Greek market. We believe that the attractiveness of our content platform across key pay-TV genres supports the sustainable leadership position of our distribution platform. While a significant part of our content business’s revenue ----- consists of carriage fees charged to our own distribution platforms (Telemach Slovenia, SBB Serbia, Telemach BH and Total TV), we also generate revenues through carriage fees paid by third-party distribution platforms, such as Telekom Slovenije, Hrvatski Telekom, T2 and A1 (formerly Si.Mobil), sales of advertising and the sublicensing of some of the sports rights we acquire to regional free-to-air broadcasters or to TV operators in Kosovo, where the Group does not have any operations. Our Sport Klub sports TV channels are by far the most in-demand channels of its content business, followed by N1 and Nova S. The following table sets forth the main sports broadcasting rights United Group held through its TV channels as at December 31, 2020. United Group has historically been successful in renewing these contracts on comparable terms.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Tušmobil is the basis for 2015 data. Our mobile network provides coverage to almost all of Slovenia’s population through our extensive 2G/ 3G/4G and as of June 2021 5G networks. Licenses for use of spectrum for 2G are valid through 2031, while spectrum for 3G is valid through 2021 (5 MHz on the 2100 band), 2023 (another 5 MHz on the 2100 band) and 2031 (5 MHz on the 900 band). In 2016, Telemach acquired additional spectrum in the 1800 MHz and 2100 MHz bands. This acquired spectrum allowed United Group to expand our 3G and 4G networks. Use of frequencies in the LTE network currently includes 2x10 MHz in the 800 MHz spectrum band and 2x10 MHz in 1800 MHz spectrum band (which is the key spectrum band used for LTE services). These licenses are valid through 2029 (800 MHz) and 2031 (1800 MHz). We are capable of providing 4G (LTE) coverage to approximately 99% of the Slovenian population and 4G+ (LTE-A) coverage to approximately 98% of the Slovenian population. In addition, we have successfully tested and are rolling out next generation 5G networks across our mobile-telephony footprint. In April 2021, Telemach Slovenia secured 15-year spectrum licenses in Slovenia for 5G frequencies, and commenced deployment and commercial launch of 5G 3600 MHz in Slovenia in June 2021. As of March 31, 2021, we had 596 thousand subscribers for our post-paid and prepaid mobile services. During each month of the first three months of 2021, Telemach Slovenia achieved 34% of gross additions in the mobile market, as compared to 32% during each month of 2020 and 31% during each month of 2019. Our principal focus is post-paid subscribers, who generate significantly higher ARPU and generally have lower ----- churn rates than prepaid subscribers, and as of March 31, 2021, contract subscribers accounted for 83% of our subscriber base. According to Fitch Solutions, in 2018, the total mobile-telephony market in Slovenia was estimated at 2.5 million subscribers compared to 596 thousand subscribers for Telemach Slovenia as of March 31, 2021, which we believe represents significant growth potential in the mobile-telephony market in Slovenia. In April 2017, we updated our mobile packages, with more data, more calls and more text messaging, and introduced our UNIFI Travel Wi Fi roaming application, providing access to more than 70 million Wi Fi hotspots around the world. All products include free on net calls with unlimited off net national calls in medium and high end packages, and with the introduction of new EU roaming regulations which took effect on June 15, 2017, customers can now utilize their text message and voice minute allotments across the EU with no roaming charges. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, Telemach Slovenia’s mobile-telephony services generated revenues of €21.3 million and an ARPU of €10.9. _Telemach Croatia_ We provide mobile-telephony services in Croatia through Telemach Croatia, the third largest telecommunications operator in Croatia based on mobile revenues as of December 31, 2020, after Croatian Telekom and A1. In the post-paid mobile segment, Telemach Croatia seeks to offer the best value proposition in the Croatian mobile market, for example through its offering of unlimited mobile services. Telemach Croatia has an extensive 2G/3G/4G mobile network covering all major cities and important roads in Croatia. In February and March 2019, Telemach Croatia acquired 2100 MHz and 2600 MHz frequencies, enhancing spectrum capacity. Telemach Croatia is participating in a 5G spectrum auction in Croatia this year. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, our mobile-telephony services in Croatia generated revenues of €32.2 million and an ARPU of €12.1. _Vivacom_ Vivacom is among the market leaders in offering mobile services in Bulgaria. Vivacom offers mobile voice and data services and products over GSM/GPRS/EDGE and UMTS/HSPA+/LTE networks, on either a post-paid or pre-paid basis, through multiple volume based and flat rate offerings, each with multiple tariff options, and we believe that Vivacom’s mobile post-paid offerings are some of the most comprehensive in the Bulgarian telecommunications market. Vivacom offers other mobile services and products, including the sale of mobile handsets and accessories. Such services include unlimited mobile data, roaming voice and mobile data packages (within the European Union or within neighboring countries), SMS and MMS and international calls to both fixed and mobile lines. In all of its post-paid tariffs, Vivacom bundles mobile TV services under the TV GO brand with over 90 channels, as well as music streaming (Tidal) and cloud storage with mobile subscriptions. In addition, all of Vivacom’s customers have access to a digital wallet (Pay by VIVACOM) that is currently free of charge. On September 21, 2020, we announced the commercial launch of our 5G network in Bulgaria, and to that end in May 2021, we secured a 20-year license for 100 MHz spectrum frequencies in the 3.6 GHz band. Vivacom is also a leading provider of a full suite of telecommunications solutions for the corporate segment, with a portfolio of services suitable for all business sizes. All business mobile plans include national and international minutes, mobile data and a range of other features that support companies in running their businesses. For large business customers, the approach is to offer customized services tailored to their specific needs. For small and medium sized companies, we offer more standardized products, such as all-inclusive tariff plans that have a set amount of minutes (national and international) and data for a fixed monthly fee. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, Vivacom’s mobile operations generated revenues of €64.0 million, representing 49% of its total revenue in the same period. Vivacom had approximately 3.0 million mobile subscribers as of March 31, 2021, of which approximately 88% were post-paid subscribers and approximately 12% were pre-paid subscribers. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, blended mobile ARPU was €7.3.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

We plan to continue to review our content offering and will continue to develop our own distinctive content. We continue to view content differentiation as the cornerstone of our strategy and to drive the attractiveness of our content offerings relative to those of our competitors. _Third-party Content_ In addition to our owned content offerings, our pay-TV distribution platforms typically license the rights for the distribution of our channels, as well as third-party owned channels, typically for a period of three to five years. As the prominent pan-regional operator, we have been able to negotiate contracts with third-party providers that we believe are beneficial. For example, we have been able to lock in flat-rate contracts for content that provide for terms spanning multiple years, which benefits our profit margins as our number of subscribers increases because we are able to retain the benefits of increases in our subscriber base, and thereby increase our margins. We also pay royalties based on our subscribers’ usage of our VoD content. We generally pay such license fees on a “per subscriber”basis. For on-demand content purchased by subscribers (transactional VoD), we generally pay a revenue share of the retail price. For packaged on-demand content, we pay on a “persubscriber”basis (subscription VoD), often subject to fixed minimum guarantees. If necessary, we also license third-party copyrights through various collective rights associations. We generally seek to negotiate fixed-fee contracts and attempt to move away from per- subscriber agreements. We expect that our content costs (above the minimum amounts) will generally increase in line with increased revenues from digital pay-TV and ondemand content and continued investment in high-quality content to differentiate our platform from our competitors. We negotiate our contracts for content and other third-party rights on a Group-wide basis, so that we are able to maximize the benefits of our scale and best practices across the Group, and we have historically been successful at renewing these contracts on comparable terms. We plan to acquire additional broadcasting rights in the future to further enhance our content offering. _Summary of Overall United Media Content_ The following table provides an overview of our content offerings:",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

We intend to utilize UNIFI to complement our bundled offering and reduce customer churn as well as to ----- incentivize the use of our products by potentially offering UNIFI free to only our subscribers. Moreover, we believe this service offers further monetization potential from users that are not our customers. In 2017, SBB Serbia and Telemach Slovenia launched UNIFI Travel, a Wi Fi service which is available in 120 countries, through more than 70 million hotspots.

This enables our customers to subscribe to these services in a convenient “one stop shop”manner at attractive prices that are lower when bundled than the sum of the stand-alone services of similar value. We believe that the several bundled options we have introduced allow our customers to tailor their packages according to their requirements and offer them greater value for money compared to similar services offered by our competitors. As of March 31, 2021, approximately 81% of our cable customers subscribed to our multi-play packages. In Bulgaria, Vivacom also offers multi-play service bundles and as of March 31, 2021, approximately 48% of Vivacom’s customers in Bulgaria are subscribed to a multi-play package. Our multi-play packages have allowed us to increase our total RGUs for cable-based services to approximately 10.6 million RGUs as of March 31, 2021. Our straightforward and unified triple-play offering, which includes pay television, broadband internet services and fixed-line telephony, accounts for a significant percentage of our total new sales, comprising 89% of our gross additions in Slovenia, 60% of our gross additions in Serbia, and 24% of our gross additions in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in each case for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Our best-selling triple-play packages (each based on the number of triple-play gross additions in the first three months of 2021) are: EON Light in Slovenia (accounting for 62% of triple-play gross additions in Slovenia); EON Full in Serbia (accounting for 47% of triple-play gross additions in Serbia); and EON Light in Bosnia and Herzegovina (accounting for 53% of triple-play gross additions in Bosnia and Herzegovina). We have upgraded our tripleplay offering consistently for both new and existing customers, which has allowed us to raise prices over time.

Our basic pay-TV subscription serves as a basis for cross-selling and up selling and, with the exception of subscribers in Slovenia who generally prefer to subscribe only to our mobile-telephony service, every subscriber needs at least a subscription for our basic pay-TV package to have access to our other services. Consumer subscriptions account for most of our revenues. Within the consumer market, we market our services directly to subscribers in single dwelling units and multi-dwelling units, such as apartment buildings. We provide our services pursuant to standard form fixed contracts lasting for 12 or 24 months. Our business subscribers typically purchase our broadband internet and voice and other data services, and we generally target small to mid-size businesses in metropolitan regions. Business subscriber contracts usually extend over a period of 24 months and cannot be prematurely cancelled free of charge. We believe that we have a loyal customer base, which is the result of low churn rates due to our high-quality content, extensive network coverage and high-quality customer service. Additionally, as our network covers the most affluent regions in Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Croatia (following the completion of the Tele2 Croatia Acquisition), Bulgaria (following the completion of the Vivacom Acquisition) and Greece (following completion of the Forthnet Acquisition), our business benefits from low rates of services termination due to customers’ inability to pay.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Our cable network covers approximately 3.7 million homes passed as of March 31, 2021 and generally covers the most affluent areas in our key markets. Specifically, as of March 31, 2021, our network passed approximately 350 thousand homes, or approximately 47% of all households, in Slovenia, 1,137 thousand homes, or approximately 47% of all households, in Serbia, 344 thousand homes, or approximately 30% of all households, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, 97 thousand homes, or approximately 49% of all households, in Montenegro and 1,797 thousand homes, or approximately 63% of all households, in Bulgaria. Our network generally offers better capacity, speed and quality advantages compared to copper-based DSL networks. In particular, an HFC cable network offers larger bandwidth than ordinary copper cable and, unlike the latter, it is not significantly affected by attenuation (a reduction in the strength of the signal) or distortion (reduction in quality of the signal) when the signal is carried over a long distance. We also offer significantly more bandwidth capacity than the average broadband customer uses. While broadband data consumption has increased across Slovenia (from 48 Gbps in 2015 to 311 Gbps in the year ended December 31, 2020), Serbia (from 97 Gbps in 2015 to 800Gbps in the year ended December 31, 2020), and Bosnia and Herzegovina (from 45 Gbps in 2015 to 238 Gbps in the year ended December 31, 2020), installed capacity is higher than the average used capacity by a significant margin, as shown in the charts below.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Our bi-directional network enables us to deliver broadband internet, fixed-line telephony, and other interactive services such as VoD, to our customers throughout our cable network, in addition to regular digital and analog television services. Our cable network is EuroDOCSIS 3.0 enabled, covering our cable broadband internet RGUs in Slovenia, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, enabling which allows us to offer theoretical maximum speed levels of up to 1,600 Mbps with 32 allocated frequency channels. In Montenegro, we continue to upgrade the network to Group standards following our acquisitions. We believe we offer one of the highest available speeds in our cable footprint, ranging between 100-1,000 Mbps. We also have industry leading node density. A lower node density mitigates the risk of network congestion and related reductions in quality of service. As of March 31, 2021, Telemach Slovenia had a node density of 1,178, Telemach BH of 1,482 and SBB Serbia of 5,212. As of March 31, 2021, our HFC network has homes passed per fiber optics node ratios of approximately 257:1 in Slovenia, approximately 208:1 in Serbia, approximately 228:1 in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and approximately 126:1 in Montenegro, which we believe is unrivalled in Southeastern Europe and compares favorably to Central and Eastern European cable benchmarks. This means our fiber optic nodes typically only extend a very short distance from subscribers’ homes and offices, with only the last few hundred meters connected through coaxial cables. This allows us to provide high broadband internet access speeds and advanced services to subscribers. We operate one of the most extensive backbone networks across the region with a national backbone consisting of approximately 21,236 kilometers (as of March 31, 2021, including Vivacom and Forthnet) owned and leased dense wavelength division multiplexing fiber links that extend across Southeastern Europe with ----- international optical interconnections to Vienna, Frankfurt, Amsterdam and London. Such extensive fiber rich backbone not only supports our HFC cable network but also makes us a partner of choice for regional telecoms and other business customers. e rent ducts and poles from third-parties as a part of our network. FttH is our technology of choice for greenfield expansion and new buildings in adjacent areas. As of March 31, 2021, we passed 950 thousand homes with FttH and had 216 thousand active users across Serbia, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro. In addition to FttH greenfield expansion, during the third quarter of 2018, we introduced Gigabit speeds in areas where digitalization of analog TV signals was completed. We complement our cable network with DTH and mobile offerings. We contract for satellite services with EUTELSAT, which transmits our satellite programming over their satellite networks to our customers. Data streams are sent to satellites that transmit the signal to local satellite receivers. Our transponder allotment agreements with EUTELSAT are valid until December 31, 2024. Pursuant to a services agreement entered into with EUTELSAT in December 2014, SBB Serbia agreed to replace all our subscriber reception boxes in order to permit the reception of HD and MPEG 4 transmissions to our subscribers via the transponders currently allocated to SBB Serbia on the EUTELSAT 16A satellite. The replacement of such subscriber reception boxes affected approximately 340,000 households. EUTELSAT agreed to assist SBB Serbia in the replacement of such equipment in order to facilitate migration to MPEG 4 technology from MPEG 2 technology. The installation of the equipment commenced in February 2015 and has since been completed. Subject to certain milestones being met, EUTELSAT has agreed to participate in the costs incurred by SBB Serbia in connection with the replacement of the equipment. Furthermore, EUTELSAT has also agreed to provide SBB Serbia with certain discounts and also provide a certain amount of free additional satellite capacity from the MPEG 4 launch date until 2024. Vivacom We believe that Vivacom’s fixed-line network is the largest in Bulgaria, and comprises an extensive copper infrastructure and a fiber network that passes 1,292 thousand FTTx homes and 505 thousand VDSL homes as of March 31, 2021. This network provides for a fully digitalized fixed-telephony services and ADSL, VDSL and fiber services that offer commercially available speeds of up to 20 Mbps, 50 Mbps and 1,000 Mbps, respectively. Vivacom also has a fully owned fiber backbone network that includes a Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing fiber network that allows for easy capacity extension and is able to route all backbone traffic via this infrastructure. Vivacom began its FTTx roll out in 2011 in Sofia and Varna and has since achieved significant progress from 402 thousand fiber homes passed in 2012 to 1,292 thousand fiber homes passed with a 27% take-up rate as of March 31, 2021. Vivacom’s fiber build out was performed in carefully selected areas based on specific return on investment criteria. We believe that Vivacom incurs low build out costs allowing for a higher return on investment in fiber, due to ownership of the ducts and the low-cost of labor in Bulgaria. Vivacom’s FTTx build out consists of a mix of FTTB and FTTH technology. The technology that is ultimately implemented depends on economics and density of the area. In addition, Vivacom owns and operates one of the biggest and most modern facilities for satellite communications in the region—Plana Teleport, which is able to deliver transmission and connectivity even to very remote points, including orbital positions in Europe, Africa, Middle East and Asia. Since 2014, Plana Teleport is a member of the World Teleport Association and in 2017 achieved full Tier 3 certification, making it among the most modern facilities of its kind. Software is incorporated into virtually every element of Vivacom’s network. Apart from operations and maintenance software provided by equipment vendors, Vivacom also has a range of specialized tools for network planning. Vivacom is in the process of implementing industry standardized IT solutions rather than customized solutions for key systems. Vivacom provides satellite services, including uplink and downlink of radio and TV channels, playout solutions, fixed and mobile VSAT data connectivity, collocation of satellite equipment and other services. In addition, Vivacom is a third-party teleport of EUTELSAT and also partners with Intelsat, SES, Gazprom, Azercosmos and Hellas Sat. Vivacom has a license for the provision of satellite services. Vivacom’s satellite services offering includes video uplink services on various satellites, Playout Solution as a Service (PSS), a cloud based service including playout hardware located at Vivacom technical facilities and an IP based tool for content management, VSAT data links, which use the latest DVB S2x technology ensuring higher data rates, optimized cost for the customer, better flexibility and reliability, and are mainly targeted at ----- the maritime business, as well as fixed VSAT links for corporate networks, in rural areas and as a backup solution and satellite collocation services. Vivacom also operates a microwave IP based network connecting main sites in Bulgaria. Vivacom uses a microwave network for delivery of DTT signal and Bulgarian national radio channels to the main TV towers. The microwave network is monitored and controlled 24/7 by the National Operations Center. Forthnet Forthnet operates and maintains a fiber optic network extending 5,927 kilometers across Greece that provides its site interconnection and backbone capacities. The services provided by Forthnet are based mainly on xDSL technologies, and Forthnet also holds a regulated local loop unbundling agreement with the incumbent telecommunications provider in Greece. As of March 31, 2021, Forthnet was able to serve 82% (93% in NGA eligible fixed lines) of the Greek population through its colocations in local exchanges and interconnections with wholesale providers. _Mobile_ Telemach Slovenia commenced a modernization program for Tušmobil’s mobile network immediately after its acquisition in April 2015. Within four months of the acquisition, the radio network on 560 mobile sites was modernized with a swap of complete 2G and 3G technology. Additionally, a 4G network was implemented alongside the existing network and prepared for a commercial launch in June 2015. By the end of 2015, the modernization of the microwave transport network was completed. Our mobile network in Slovenia is fully IP enabled, with SRAN (single radio access network technology) providing full services on 2G, 3G and 4G networks. We currently provide 4G (LTE) and 4G+ (LTE-A) coverage to approximately 99% and 97%, respectively, of the Slovenian population. In 2020, we added 54 additional mobile sites to our footprint. In 2021, Telemach Slovenia expects to launch a total of 55 new sites, which we expect will lead to 4G (LTE) and 4G+ (LTE-A) coverage for approximately 99% of the Slovenian population. The technology upgrades and new sites are expected to increase Telemach Slovenia’s coverage, amplify our network capacity and enhance customer experience. In April 2021, Telemach Slovenia secured 15-year spectrum licenses in Slovenia for 5G frequency bands and commenced commercial deployment of 5G in Slovenia in June 2021. Telemach Croatia, having successfully launched its 4G service, covers all major cities and important roads in Croatia. Telemach Croatia has also acquired 2100MHz and 2600MHz frequencies to support spectrum capacity. Telemach Croatia is participating in a 5G spectrum auction in Croatia this year. Vivacom Vivacom offers mobile services through its integrated 2G, 3G and 4G/LTE network. In 2018, Vivacom launched a 4G voice service (Voice over LTE) and Wi Fi calling services, which enable Vivacom’s customers to benefit from high definition voice services. On September 21, 2020, Vivacom announced the commercial launch of its 5G network in Bulgaria, and to that end in May 2021, Vivacom secured a 20-year license for 100 MHz spectrum frequencies in the 3.6 GHz band. To scale the development of its 5G network quickly, Vivacom uses dynamic spectrum sharing on its existing 4G network, enabling it to provide 5G coverage to all 27 district cities in Bulgaria. Other than its 5G network, Vivacom’s network is based on: GSM/EDGE (2G technologies), UMTS/HSPA+ (3G technologies) and LTE/LTE-Advanced (4G/4.5G technologies). As of March 31, 2021, Vivacom’s GSM mobile network covered 99.99% of the Bulgarian population, its UMTS mobile network covered 99.99% of the Bulgarian population, and its LTE network covered 99.94% of the Bulgarian population. Vivacom’s licenses allow it to use 2x11.2 MHz on the 900 MHz spectrum band, 2x15MHz on the 1800 MHz spectrum band and 2x15MHz on the 2100 MHz spectrum band. As of March 31, 2021, Vivacom’s mobile network is supported by a portfolio of 3,675 tower sites across Bulgaria, of which 42% have fiber backhauling. Vivacom covers over 681 networks by roaming agreements with other Bulgarian and international operators around the world as of March 31, 2021. Mobile Network Evolution During 2021, we entered into two global framework agreements for the provision of equipment and services for our mobile networks in Bulgaria, Croatia and Slovenia that are material to the evolution and upkeep of our mobile networks, including commercial implementation of next generation 5G capabilities. ----- - Mobile Radio Network Equipment Agreement We entered into a global frame agreement with Huawei International Co. Limited (“Huawei”) for the supply of radio network equipment for our mobile networks, which was effective as of April 16, 2021.

Pursuant to the terms of the contract, we agreed to purchase, and with the assistance of Huawei install and operate, certain radio equipment, receive spare parts, reuse certain legacy equipment and use or license certain other items from Huawei upon certain agreed terms and subject to certain conditions. Entry into this global frame agreement is a continuation of our existing work with Huawei, which we believe we have at all times conducted in compliance with relevant laws and regulations. - Mobile Core Network Elements Agreement As part of a strategy to consolidate our core network vendors, we also entered into a global frame agreement with Nokia Solutions and Networks Oy as of June 17, 2021, for the supply, installation, commissioning, migration, support and network evolution of mobile core network elements for our mobile networks. The contract has a duration of 5 years, subject to renewal and extension. The contract sets out the terms and conditions pursuant to which the agreed equipment and services will be supplied during duration of the contract. - Network Maintenance We introduced a new preventative maintenance platform in 2016 to monitor our network by categorizing and ranking the nodes across our network and providing guidance about which system maintenance works are most needed, which has improved both our network quality and customer satisfaction experience. Furthermore, our internal maintenance regime is also stricter than industry standards. Vivacom has made significant investments into its network over the last few years, and it plans to continue the build out of its fiber network in carefully selected areas based on specific return on investment criteria. We also intend to invest further in Vivacom’s fixed network, including MPLS and Metro networks, and the fixed access network, as well as the mobile core and access networks supported by new spectrum frequencies and microwave licenses for transmission.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

382_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1122,PRO-FORMA MAR 2021,1122.45,"Focus on Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (“ESG”) Matters",1122.45.1,,"As we have grown our Group, we have increased our emphasis on integrating ESG considerations into our decision-making and reporting processes. To that end, in 2020, we established a dedicated ESG coordinator role within the Group. We have also established a multi-disciplinary team of senior executives who, together with independent consultants, finalized in 2020 a detailed ESG action plan and implementation roadmap. While more than half of our Group (by revenue) already produces ESG reports, we are working to expand our current reporting, procedures, products and activities to better identify and address ESG considerations ----- using, among other standards, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) materiality matrix for telecommunications and media. Our main goal is to provide fast and reliable connections to information, knowledge and entertainment, which in itself represents the infrastructure of the modern world on which many of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals are based. As part of our continued development in this area, the following are key focus areas and associated KPIs, which we are using to improve upon existing practices and set and exceed new goals for ESG matters. - Environmental sustainability. To promote environmental sustainability in our operations, we are taking active steps to minimize our environmental footprint, while also collecting and analyzing Group historical data to set future KPI targets for reductions in carbon emissions, climate change policy, energy use and energy sourcing. We have committed to the Science Based Targets initiative which helps to drive climate action in the private sector by enabling companies to set emissions reduction targets with scientific data and to that end we have also submitted a net-zero target in line with a “1.5° future.” During our data gathering, we determined that electricity represents the greatest source (approximately 86%) and opportunity for the reduction of carbon emissions by switching to clean energy. We focus on promoting environmental sustainability through the use of renewable energy, reducing scrap waste, recycling and other strategies. We are committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions across our offices and infrastructure and we established a solar power plant in Slovenia in 2019 with an annual production capacity of 254 kWh and have leveraged our experience in this project to look for additional green energy projects which could cover a significant part of our carbon emission footprint. In 2020, we consumed 295.5 MWh of energy generated from all sources and we generated 232.6 MWh of renewable energy from our solar plant in Slovenia. In addition, we use electric vehicles in our operations where feasible, and we work to exchange old, less-energy efficient equipment for more energy efficient devices. In 2020, we generated approximately 128.1 thousand tons of CO2 emissions (9.3 thousand tons of scope 1 emissions and 118.8 thousand tons of scope 2 and 3 emissions), including the contribution of acquired companies, and we target to reduce these to approximately 50.6 thousand tons by 2030. We are also committed to reducing the climate footprint of our customers by facilitating access to information, connectivity and entertainment by means of our high speed network, which provides an incentive to reduce their need to travel. Furthermore, as the rapid development of broadband, television and IT technology necessitates the continual replacement of legacy network elements and the upgrading of our networks to accommodate increased bandwidth requirements and new services, we have introduced waste management procedures, and we regularly recycle obsolete equipment. In 2020, we recycled 1,539 tons of network telecom equipment, batteries, cables, paper and cardboard. We are also committed to minimizing waste and we repurpose, reuse or recycle 100% of returned customer devices and accessories. Certain of our larger telecommunications operations either have achieved or are pursuing ISO 14001:2015 certification, a global standard for environmental management. We also recognize the importance of responsible procurement and supply chain management, and to that end, we have developed Group-level procurement policies to align procurement activities across Group companies, including adding environmental factors in our request for proposals when engaging with new suppliers. Our procurement procedure includes multiple checks and verification requirements, such as international sanctions and reputation risk evaluation. To promote environmental sustainability in our operations, we expect each of our operating company to (i) comply with all applicable legal requirements and group-wide environmental policy, (ii) implement appropriate control, including specific environmental procedures, (iii) implement an environment-focused management structure, (iv) commit to reduce energy and fuel consumption, as well as business travel and associated greenhouse gas emissions, (v) commit to the efficient use of resources and materials used for packaging and products to reduce waste, (vi) commit to a circular economic model, and (viii) provide selected employees with the relevant environmental management traiining to undertake their duties and responsibilities effectively. - Community engagement. We actively support the communities in which we operate, and in 2020, we named a Group-level director for corporate social responsibility to coordinate efforts in this regard among our operating companies. At an operational level, our Group companies exercise significant control over their own community engagement projects due to the particularities of each company, country and culture. We have as a Group donated €4.5 million in 2020 and €2.6 million for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, to groups and activities dedicated to protecting the environment, education and the socially vulnerable, as well as other donations, such as donating personal protective equipment to help fight COVID-19. We have also fostered digital inclusivity by engaging in multiple community engagement activities in the past few years, with a focus on using our platform to deliver knowledge to children (including programs for online safety), students, the general public and disadvantaged groups, by leveraging our core competencies in broadband internet and other telecommunications. For 2021, we aim to increase the percentage of staff ----- participating in a community engagement activity (e.g., volunteering time or knowledge), which in 2020 stood at 7%. As part of our obligations to protect customer data, we are aligning our Group data protection policies to standardize processes and continue our track record of no fines since GDPR came into force. We do this via regular training programs, penetration testing and vulnerability scanning of our IT systems, with some of our Group companies having obtained ISO/IEC 27001:2013 certification as well. - Corporate and employee responsibility. We focus on building a safe, fair and inclusive working environment for our employees. To inform our social management targets, we collect data on our workforce, such as gender mix (55% male, 45% female), percentage of women in management positions (30%, including our Chief Executive Officer) and percentage of disabled employees (1%), in each case, as of March 31, 2021. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, staff total turnover is 12% and we have experienced 50 workplace injury incidents. We aim to improve these metrics throughout 2021. In particular, we track gender equality KPIs with the aim of ensuring women’s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision making in political, economic and public life. We also have mandated diversity and inclusion rules and have documented these in employee manuals at our Group companies, which include, among others, statutory requirements related to workers’ rights and human rights (e.g., anti-discrimination and anti-mobbing) and annual employee Net Promoter Score (“eNPS”) measurements. To facilitate further transparency and accountability, we plan to expand our anonymous suggestion boxes already present in certain of our Group companies and establish whistle-blowing programs as a distinct transparency function. We also offer training programs to employees which are focused on improving job-related technical and management skills, as well as on compliance with our internal policies. We have established internal training centers which manage the entire training process from on-boarding to organizing advanced technical and management education provided by external experts. In 2020, we began an ambitious eNPS training program, which we plan to continue in 2021. During this period, we invested approximately 40 hours of training per employee for new hires and 10 hours per existing employee across our telecommunication operating companies. Our eNPS training efforts and other initiatives contributed to a significant increase of 46 points in eNPS score from 2019 to 2020, and it currently averages at +10. In addition, we have developed a specific supplier code of conduct, which includes elements related to labor standards, particularly to health and safety and relevant International Labour Organisation standards. We expect to introduce our supplier code of conduct across all of our companies in the second half of 2021, in order to harmonize the existing processes and standards already in place at some of our group companies. - Shareholder support for ESG development. As we continue to make progress in ESG matters, we are wholly supported in our efforts by our majority shareholder, BC Partners. BC Partners is a primary signatory to the United Nations’ Principles of Responsible Investments, adopting these principles in 2009. BC Partners has formalized its commitment to increased standards in its own ESG strategy, and takes an active role in improving ESG awareness, performance and compliance with us and its other portfolio companies.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

382_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1122,PRO-FORMA MAR 2021,1122.50,Legal Proceedings,1122.50.1,Litigation Matters Relating to Telemach Slovenia (as successor to Tušmobil),"_Administrative Matters_ A block of spectrum that we were granted and use for part of Telemach Slovenia’s 3G mobile network may be subject to a renewed tender or other regulatory action. The grant of this block of 2x5 MHz of spectrum in the 2100 MHz band in 2008 to Tušmobil (which in April 2015 was acquired by, and later merged into, Telemach Slovenia) was successfully challenged before the Slovenian administrative court. This block of spectrum is valid through 2023 and is used to operate part of Telemach Slovenia’s 3G mobile network. The grant of this block of spectrum was challenged by certain competitors on the grounds that Tušmobil obtained the spectrum (i) without satisfying certain requirements of a public tender and (ii) as a consequence of Tušmobil participating in the tender as the only interested party, obtaining such spectrum free of charge. The case arising from this challenge has been through various levels of reviews and decisions by AKOS, the Slovenian administrative court, the Slovenian Supreme Court and the Slovenian constitutional court. Some of these decisions reaffirmed the initial grant of this block of spectrum. However, the Slovenian administrative court ordered in November 2017 that the tender process be renewed and that Telekom Slovenije (a Slovenian competitor of Telemach Slovenia) be allowed to participate in the renewed grant process. This order has become final. On May 31, 2019, following the Slovenian Administrative Court’s final ruling in November 2017, AKOS issued a new decision by which it rejected Tušmobil’s request from January 30, 2008 (as amended on April 3, 2008) for allocation of spectrum in the 2100 MHz band and reversed its 2008 decision with effect from September 30, 2019. On June 30, 2019, we filed a lawsuit challenging AKOS’ May 31, 2019 decision together with a motion to issue an interim injunction to stay AKOS’ decision until the Slovenian Administrative Court reaches a final decision. On July 11, 2019, the Slovenian Administrative Court issued an interim injunction staying AKOS’ decision pending a final decision on the lawsuit, and therefore Telemach Slovenia remained entitled to use such spectrum. On July 5, 2021, the Slovenian administrative court ruled in our favor reversing AKOS’ May 31, 2019 decision and sent the matter back to AKOS to undertake a new determination process. Notwithstanding such recent ruling by the Slovenian administrative court, we cannot eliminate the possibility that we may not be successful in a renewed tender or that a charge may be imposed by AKOS for the past use of the spectrum or that we may need to pay a fee or rent for use of the spectrum. See “Risk Factors—Risks _Relating to Our Business and Industry—We have made and may make acquisitions or enter into transactions that may present unforeseen risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction and, additionally, there are risks associated with the integration of any acquisitions.”_ ----- In 2016, Telemach Slovenia was successful in acquiring additional 2100 MHZ (valid through September 2021) and 1800 MHz (valid through January 2031) spectrum licenses. In April 2021, a spectrum auction for all available mobile spectrum bands was held in Slovenia, and Telemach Slovenia was successful in bidding for 2x10 MHz in the 700 MHz band, 20 MHz in the 1500 MHz band, 2x15 MHz in the 2100 MHz band, 30 MHz in 2300 MHZ band, 140 MHz in the 3600 MHz band and 200 MHz in the 26 GHz band. These licenses are valid for 15 years. Courts have so far dismissed on procedural grounds two challenges brought by one of the operators against the auctions results. As of the date of this offering memorandum, the deadline in which an interested person could challenge the decision on allocation of such frequencies before the administrative court has passed, and we have not been served with any such challenge. However, the absence of such challenge could not yet be officially confirmed. We believe that these additional frequencies granted in 2016 (and currently used by Telemach Slovenia) and frequencies acquired in 2021 mitigate the impact of any potential loss of the block of 2x5 MHz of spectrum in the 2100 MHz band that was granted to Tušmobil in 2008 and which will expire in 2023, after which they will be assigned to another bidder who secures them for the period after 2023. _Criminal Matters_ Certain criminal matters were initiated in Slovenia against Telemach Slovenia (as successor to Tušmobil) which are still pending against Tušmobil’s former owner Mirko Tuš and Tomaž Simonič (the former head of AKOS). Pursuant to a bill of indictment that was filed in March 2015 (and amended in May 2019) by the public prosecutor in connection with these criminal matters, which were initially instigated by Tušmobil’s competitors in 2008, it is alleged that, among other things, Tušmobil and Mirko Tuš made illegal payments to Tomaž Simonič, a former head of AKOS, to obtain the grant of a block of 2x5 MHz of spectrum in the 2100 MHz band in 2008. The bill of indictment filed by the public prosecutor also challenges AKOS’ decision in 2006 to allow Tušmobil to exchange a certain radio frequency band (1,800 MHz) for another band (900 MHz) at no charge and without obtaining the views of other interested parties. It is also alleged that Tušmobil and Mirko Tuš made illegal payments to the former head of AKOS to obtain the exchange of frequencies at no cost. Due to the expiration of the statute of limitations, Telemach Slovenia as a legal entity has been found free of criminal liability (with the effect of finality) and related exposure to penalties or fines. However, as a beneficiary of the frequencies grant, Telemach Slovenia may be jointly and severally liable with other defendants (against which proceedings are still pending) for indemnification of the allegedly illegally gained benefit if any of the remaining defendants are found guilty. In February 2020, the first instance court acquitted Mr. Simonič of the charges in the amended bill of indictment (misuse of the public positions or rights). In December 2020, upon the public prosecutor’s appeal, the Higher Court of Ljubljana annulled this judgment and returned the case to the first instance court for retrial. The criminal proceedings against Mirko Tuš have been from time to time separated from the other trials and may be conducted separately. In a related development, in January 2016, the Republic of Slovenia made a claim against Mirko Tuš and Telemach Slovenia for indemnification in an amount of €7.2 million. During the pre-trial hearings, Telemach Slovenia contested the grounds for, and challenged the amount of, this claim. While the bill of indictment filed by the public prosecutor in March 2015 had indicated that Tušmobil allegedly illegally gained benefit in an amount of approximately €7.2 million, representing a valuation of the potential charge for the frequency bands under challenge, which had been estimated by an expert appointed by the court for such purpose, Telemach Slovenia has contested and opposed, and intends to continue to contest and oppose this valuation. Furthermore, if either of the two remaining defendants is found guilty in any of these criminal matters, AKOS could in turn review, whether upon its own initiative or if ordered to do so by a competent authority, the grant of the block of 2x5 MHz of spectrum in the 2100 MHz band to Tušmobil and potentially annul its prior allotment decision and initiate new proceedings for the allotment of the block of spectrum. If any payment obligation is imposed against Telemach Slovenia or the criminal procedure is closed with any negative impact in these matters, we, in turn, could seek to recover these amounts from Tušmobil’s seller based on certain provisions set forth in the transaction documents that we have entered into with Tušmobil’s seller. For instance, under the share sale and purchase agreement, we have recourse to up to €168 million in indemnification from the seller for losses arising from breaches of warranties related to financial crime, which we could seek to claim against in the event of a final, non-appealable judgment requiring Tušmobil to pay monetary fines or in the case of a negative impact to the conduct of business, reputation and assets of Telemach Slovenia resulting from the criminal procedure (which indemnification is not available for the separate AKOS proceeding described under “—Administrative Matters”). However, we may not be successful in any actions to claim indemnity or damages from Tušmobil’s seller in a timely manner or at all, and the indemnifying party may not have sufficient funds to fulfil its indemnification obligations. See “Risk Factors— ----- _Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—We have made and may make acquisitions or enter into transactions that may present unforeseen risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction and, additionally, there are risks associated with the integration of any acquisitions.”_ The AKOS administrative action and the criminal proceedings described above relate to the block of spectrum obtained by Tušmobil in 2008 (and the exchange of certain frequency bands in 2006), and do not affect the ownership or validity of the spectrum used for 4G/LTE and legacy 2G that Tušmobil was awarded in 2014 (for the period from 2014 to 2029) or the ownership or validity of the additional 3G and 4G/LTE frequencies allotted to Telemach Slovenia in 2016 (for periods until 2021 and 2031) or the recently acquired spectrum at the auction in April 2021. Nevertheless, if the AKOS action or the pending criminal proceedings are determined in a manner adverse to Telemach Slovenia, and Telemach Slovenia is required to lease such block of spectrum in the future, or is required to pay a material amount as part of an indemnity, and Telemach Slovenia is not able to recover such amounts from the Tušmobil seller, such developments could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and profitability.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

In March 2019, the Serbian Tax Authority issued a decision that it had recharacterized interest payments made by SBB Serbia under an intragroup loan agreement (and certain other transactions) as dividends, the payments of which would have been subject to a 5% withholding tax. The total contingent liability under this decision amounts to €21 million, including late interest. We have assessed these matters internally and through external consultants, and it is our view that there is no basis for the Serbian Tax Authority’s decision. We have appealed to the Serbian Ministry of Finance and received a prolongation of our obligation to pay any amounts until resolution of the appeal. We have also submitted a request for a mutual agreement procedure (“MAP”) for our Dutch entities to the Dutch Ministry of Finance on the basis that the Serbian taxation decision is not in compliance with the double taxation treaty between the Netherlands and Serbia. The Dutch Ministry of Finance has notified the Serbian Tax Authority of the MAP procedure. The Dutch Ministry of Finance has also submitted a letter to the Serbian Ministry of Finance stating that Serbia has misclassified the interest payments and is in breach of the bilateral double taxation treaty. On October 12, 2020, the Serbian Ministry of Finance annulled the Serbian Tax Authority’s decision and instructed the Serbian Tax Authority to restart the procedure, taking into account the arguments provided in SBB Serbia’s appeal. The Serbian Tax Authority also informed SBB Serbia that it is opening a tax review for the years 2013 through 2016. SBB Serbia intends to continue contesting the Serbian Tax Authority’s findings.

These include certain claims asserted in a civil lawsuit brought in the period from 2013 to 2015 seeking damages relating to alleged breaches of contractual and/or statutory duties by HS, HKB, M&H, the former majority shareholder and the former management of these companies. The aggregate amount claimed by the minority shareholder in these cases is approximately €12.2 million, plus interest and costs of the proceedings. These claims are in the preliminary stages of litigation, and no final, enforceable decision will be rendered until the claims have been adjudicated by both the court of first instance and (if appealed) the secondary appellate court. It is difficult to estimate the final amount of damages (which will, in due course, be subject to valuation by an expert appointed by the court) and when such adjudication would be completed. In June 2015, the minority shareholder of HS and HKB also brought a civil lawsuit seeking to annul Telemach BH’s purchase of HS and HKB. Specifically, the former minority shareholder contended that it was not provided with sufficient information to allow it to determine whether to exercise its statutory right of first refusal relating to the sale of HS and HKB. This claim is still in the preliminary stages. The aggregate purchase price paid for the acquisition of HS and HKB as approximately €7 million. The minority shareholder has also brought a number of additional claims against Telemach BH and, in the alternative, HS, HKB and M&H relating to the corporate decision by which certain business opportunities were transferred to M&H from HS and HKB, allegedly undertaken by the former majority shareholder of these companies. While we do not believe that these claims are well-founded, we have nonetheless out of an abundance of caution suspended the contracts for which these claims were initiated. The minority shareholder has also filed a criminal complaint with the office of the public prosecutor in Bosnia and Herzegovina alleging criminal wrongdoing by the former majority shareholder and former management of these companies. This proceeding is still in the investigative phase, and no indictment or other criminal charge has been filed. The status of, and information relating to, criminal investigations generally in Bosnia and Herzegovina is not publicly available.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

The proceedings are at different stages, as the proceedings that began in 2012 and 2016, and some of the proceedings that began in 2018 and 2019, are currently being considered by the Constitutional Court, while some of the proceedings that were initiated in 2018, 2019 and 2020 are pending before either the first instance court or the Higher Court. In all of the pending cases, United Group has filed legal challenges to any adverse decisions of the courts. Where the court decisions issued in the respective proceedings have already become final, we have paid the amounts adjudicated by the courts, while in July 2021 we have also paid the most commonly adjudicated amount per user for the period 2016 to mitigate the accrual of the late payment interest.

The Slovenian Competition Protection Agency also ordered us to divest the activity of broadcasting the Sport Klub (SK) TV channels within six months and imposed a ban prohibiting us from broadcasting sports TV channels in Slovenia (with the exception of the existing Fight Channel) for the period of three years from the day we transfer the Sport Klub (SK) TV channels to a suitable buyer. The activity of broadcasting Sport Klub (SK) TV channels includes purchasing rights for transmitting audiovisual sport TV content for Sport Klub (SK) TV channels, producing Sport Klub (SK) TV channels and offering Sport Klub (SK) TV channels to operators in the wholesale TV channel market, in each case, limited to the territory of Slovenia. The Slovenian Supreme Court has stayed the implementation of the Slovenian Competition Protection Authority’s divestment decision until a final decision on the merits of this case is issued. With a judgment dated May 21, 2020, the administrative court annulled the decision of the Competition Protection Agency and ordered the Agency to restart the concentration assessment procedure. The Agency is now required to reexamine the transaction and adopt a new decision. Although the decision on divestiture only relates to Slovenia, it may have negative consequences for us in other markets, including on our reputation, brand equity and perceived value proposition, which could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. In relation to this proceeding, the Slovenian Competition Protection Authority in a separate (misdemeanor) proceeding imposed on United Media Limited a fine of €3.7 million for delayed merger control filing. We challenged this fine before the administrative court. On January 11, 2021, the administrative court ruled that the fine should be reduced to €1.56 million. We appealed this ruling and requested a further reduction in the amount of the fine. Moreover, independently from any final decision related to the merger approval, in addition to an obligation to comply with the decision, a fine of up to a legal maximum of 10% of our annual revenue could be imposed on us in a separate misdemeanor proceeding for not having obtained merger clearance prior to operating IKO Balkan. In previous decisions when the Slovenian Competition Protection Agency has, following or in parallel with granting merger clearance, levied fines against companies for exercising control prior to obtaining merger clearance, the percentage of the fine has been materially less than 10% of the overall group revenue, and in an unrelated recent case, the Slovenian Competition Protection Agency fined an undertaking for failure to provide notification of a concentration in the amount of approximately €54 million, which, according to publicly available sources, amounted to approximately 1% of the relevant group’s revenue, whereby such fine was later reduced by the County Court of Ljubljana to €1,000,000. In February 2015, the Slovenian Competition Protection Agency initiated an investigation regarding alleged abuse of dominant position by United Media Limited, former company IKO Balkan (now United Media Distribution) and its former Slovenian subsidiary IKO Media PRO d.o.o. in the wholesale market for the supply of pay-TV sports channels in Slovenia for a period beginning around August 2012. This proceeding is currently pending as no statement of objections has been issued by the Slovenian Competition Protection Agency. Possible impacts of a decision adverse to us include: (i) an obligation to cease the infringement (if any); (ii) imposition of measures to remedy any proven abuse of dominant position; (iii) imposition of a monetary fine of up to 10% of the annual turnover of United Media Limited and United Media Distribution in the preceding business year; (iv) the imposition of a criminal charge; and (v) damages claims from third parties.

RTS claimed approximately €1.5 million in damages and a temporary injunction seeking to prohibit SBB Serbia from broadcasting the plaintiff’s programs. The Serbian Law on Electronic Media categorizes RTS programs as “must carry” channels which all media operators in Serbia are obligated to carry, regardless of what platforms operators employ in their distribution. On February 26, 2019, the trial ----- court determined a breach of RTS’rights as the broadcasting manufacturer had occurred and prohibited SBB Serbia from distributing RTS programs via EON but denied the claim for damages.

Generally, the relevant agreements are entered into for up to one year. The price under these agreements was initially €10-12.2 per pole per year. However, in late 2018, EPS increased prices to €20-25 per pole per year. EPS did not provide an adequate reasoning for such a substantial price increase. In January 2019, SBB Serbia submitted a complaint against these pricing practices to the Serbian Competition Authority. In June 2019, SBB Serbia submitted a request for joint usage of EPS infrastructure to RATEL. In October 2019, RATEL granted SBB Serbia the right to jointly use EPS infrastructure but left the question of pricing open, claiming that if the price offered by EPS is regulated differently the operators that already signed contracts under such commercial terms would end up in an unequal position. Both EPS and SBB Serbia challenged RATEL’s decision before the Administrative Court, and this case is currently pending. In February 2020, EPS brought a claim against SBB Serbia before the Belgrade Commercial Court for €1.18 million allegedly due by SBB Serbia for the usage of EPS’s infrastructure. EPS also asked the Court to order SBB Serbia to remove its equipment from EPS infrastructure. A preliminary hearing was held on October 14, 2020. At the hearing, SBB Serbia challenged the Court’s jurisdiction and the Court announced that it would issue a separate ruling on this issue.

InterV was purchased by its former shareholders by way of private sale closed in August 2016 from its creditors following a sale process run by Ernst & Young after an enforcement of security over its shares by such creditors. Certain previous direct and indirect shareholders of the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder have ----- initiated legal proceedings in the United Kingdom and Luxembourg which relate to the ownership of shares in the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder. Certain other legal proceedings in relation to Vivacom and its previous share ownership and obligations in Bulgaria have been resolved. The following is a description of ongoing legal proceedings in relation to these matters. _United Kingdom Litigation_ Certain previous direct and indirect shareholders of the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder initiated legal proceedings in the United Kingdom in 2016, alleging that the auction pursuant to which the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder’s current shareholders acquired the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder was a sham and part of a fraudulent conspiracy, and seeking an order that the 2016 sale be unwound and/or that damages be awarded. In February 2018, the courts in the United Kingdom dismissed all claims aimed at unwinding the sale and dismissed a claim for damages in respect of the alleged loss of the indirect interest in the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder by its previous indirect shareholders. New claims were brought on behalf of the previous direct shareholder of the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder, which were struck out by the UK courts in July 2019 for lack of authority and on jurisdictional grounds. Currently, the only outstanding claim in the United Kingdom is a damages claim between certain indirect former shareholders of the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder against (among others) former shareholders and former creditors of the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder for the alleged loss of opportunity to participate in the 2016 auction and acquire control over the Vivacom Group. The outstanding English proceedings were stayed in January 2020 (and remain so) pending the outcome of the Main Luxembourg Proceedings (as defined below). Such damages claim relates to matters as between certain indirect former shareholders of the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder and former shareholders and creditors of the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder and therefore does not relate to Vivacom or us as the claim has no relation to the Vivacom Acquisition. _Luxembourg Litigation_ - Main Luxembourg Proceedings After dismissal in February 2018 and July 2019 of the claims in relation to the unwinding of the 2016 sale in the United Kingdom, the complainants (previous direct and indirect shareholders of the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder acting through managers of its indirect shareholder) re-instated their claims in Luxembourg in July 2019 (the “Main Luxembourg Proceedings”). Similarly to the proceedings in the United Kingdom, the complainants are seeking to unwind the 2016 sale of the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder and/or to receive damages. While the outcome of the Main Luxembourg Proceedings cannot be determined, we believe that, on the basis of the information and documents we possess, it is likely a Luxembourg judge will rule in a similar manner as the UK courts. Even if a Luxembourg judge did agree with the complainants, we believe that the most likely remedy would be the payment of damages by the former direct and/or indirect owners of the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder (or other persons/entities involved in the 2016 sale) to previous owners of the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder, rather than any remedy involving Vivacom or us. Further, an outcome favorable to the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder’s previous direct and indirect shareholders is unlikely to have an adverse impact on us or the Vivacom Group. Other than in respect of the Vivacom Acquisition Agreement, neither we nor United Group Bulgaria have a direct or indirect relationship with the former direct or indirect shareholders of the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder. Moreover, United Group Bulgaria acquired Viva Telecom’s shares (and not the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder shares) in an arm’s length transaction for fair market value pursuant to a public auction process organized by a reputable financial advisor. The Main Luxembourg Proceedings are ongoing and are expected to continue for at least the next two to three years. Although we have been summoned to join the Main Luxembourg Proceedings (as described below), the Main Luxembourg Proceedings and the Intervention Proceedings (as defined below) are currently managed separately by the Luxembourg Court, so that we are currently not requested to actively participate in the Main Luxembourg Proceedings. - Intervention Proceedings Following signing of the Vivacom Acquisition Agreement, we have been summoned to be joined to the Main Luxembourg Proceedings (the “Intervention Proceedings”) for purposes of putting us on notice of the Main ----- Luxembourg Proceedings. No claims have been made against us in the Intervention Proceedings and the Intervention Proceedings are still ongoing. The complainants in the Main Luxembourg Proceedings have in the meantime withdrawn their intervention claim. However, as we have raised doubts as to the formal procedural validity of this withdrawal, the parties are currently in the process of filing briefs on the withdrawal (among other issues). - Second Luxembourg Proceedings In March and April 2020, previous direct and indirect shareholders of the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder initiated new proceedings in Luxembourg (the “Second Luxembourg Proceedings”). Similar to the Main Luxembourg Proceedings, the claimants argue that the 2016 sale of the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder should be unwound, and as a consequence, any subsequent event resulting from that sale, including the Vivacom Acquisition should also be unwound. The parties are currently exchanging written submissions, and given the large number of defendants, the proceedings in Luxembourg are expected to continue for at least the next two to three years.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

382_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1122,PRO-FORMA MAR 2021,1122.51,Regulatory Framework,1122.51.1,Slovenia,"Telecommunications operations in Slovenia are subject to the EU framework on telecommunications regulation. The act governing telecommunications in Slovenia is the Electronic Communications Act (Zakon o elektronskih komunikacijah—ZEKom-1), which came into force on January 15, 2013 (as amended). The principal objectives of ZEKom-1 include promoting the development of electronic communications networks and services, including encouraging investment by lowering construction and set up costs of such networks and the development of services in the Republic of Slovenia alongside economic and social development, the establishment of effective competition on the electronic communications market, and consumer protection. The act aims to achieve these objectives principally by governing the conditions for the provision of electronic communication networks and services, effective construction and set up of such networks and shared use of existing physical infrastructure, ensuring competition, determining users’ rights, regulating the security and operation of networks and services in emergency situations, the protection of secrecy and confidentiality of electronic communications and setting forth the responsibilities and tasks of AKOS, which is an independent body that, among other things, regulates and supervises the electronic communications market. _Becoming an Operator_ A legal entity seeking to become an operator is required to notify AKOS about its intent to operate public communication networks or to provide public communication services prior to the beginning of the performance of its activities. The notification must include the required general information about the legal entity (such as the name and address, legal representatives etc.), a short description of the public communication networks or public communication services, as well as a description of the network, network elements, links and the planned date of the beginning of the operation of public communication networks or the provision of public communication services. ----- Within seven days from receipt of the complete notification, AKOS registers the operator in its official register and submits a confirmation notice to the operator (such confirmation is not an administrative decision and does not itself create rights and obligations under the ZEKom-1). Foreign operators that wish to acquire the status of an operator have two options: they can either establish a subsidiary in Slovenia or acquire a Slovenian tax number. _Required Notifications_ An operator must notify AKOS about: - changes to the company’s name, address or headquarters, legal representatives, network or services; AKOS must be notified about these changes within 30 days from their occurrence; - changes to the starting date of the operation of public communication networks or the provision of public communication services or changes to the geographic area in which the network is operated or the services are provided; AKOS must be notified about these changes prior to their occurrence; and - the termination of the operation of public communication networks or the termination of the provision of public communication services; AKOS must be informed in writing and at least 90 days prior to the planned termination. _Annual Fee_ All operators must pay an annual fee to AKOS. The amount of the annual fee under the ZEKom-1 is based on the operator’s revenue that results from the provision of public communication networks or public communication services and is calculated by AKOS. In its decision, the Slovenian Constitutional Court ruled that basing the calculation of the annual fee on revenue is unconstitutional. _Radio Frequency Spectrum_ On the basis of a public tender AKOS, issues decisions on the award of radio frequencies for provision of public communication services to end-users. AKOS issues the decision on award of radio frequencies for a limited time period, taking into account appropriate time for amortization of investment, however not longer than 15 years. The validity of a decision on award of radio frequencies for provision of public communication services to end-users may not be prolonged. The holder of the decision on award of radio frequencies may transfer its right to use such radio frequency to a third-party with a prior consent of AKOS. Operators may not accumulate radio frequencies with the objective of limiting competition on the radio communication market. Such accumulation may be established by the fact that the operator is not using the radio frequency as determined under the award decision or if it is otherwise apparent from the operator’s actions that it acquired the radio frequency with the purpose of limiting competition on the market. AKOS may ex officio change the decision on award of radio frequency in order to ensure effective use of radio frequency spectrum for the public good or for certain other causes as prescribed by law. AKOS may, among other things, annul the decision of awarding radio frequency if the award was acquired on the basis of untrue data, if the holder no longer complies with the requirements laid down in the relevant legislation or the decision itself, does not begin to use the radio frequency within the prescribed time period, transfers the right to a third-party, or if the fee for the use of radio frequency or the fee for effective use of finite commodity have not been paid. The holder of a decision on award of radio frequency must pay an annual usage fee to AKOS. The amount of the annual fee is based on the coverage and density of population; however, it may not restrict or hinder competition or market entry. In order to ensure optimal use of radio frequencies, holders of decisions on award of radio frequencies for provision of public communication services must also pay a fee for effective use of finite commodity. The minimal amount of such payment and terms of payment shall be determined in the decision on the initiation of the public tender procedure on the basis of demand for tendered frequencies, development of the market or amount of payment in other EU member states. The fee should not, however, unduly hinder the provision of innovative services and competition. _Numbering Plan_ AKOS adopts the numbering plan with a general act that determines the type, length, and structure of the numbering elements, their intended use, and manner of use, including numbers for emergency calls and ----- numbers the use of which is harmonized based on EU regulations. This general act must also support number portability and the introduction of new electronic communication services. The operator’s application for the allocation of numbering elements must include: - the company’s name and address, its VAT identification number and the name of its legal representatives; - evidence that the company has the right to be allocated numbering elements; - data on the type and quantity of the numbering elements it wishes to acquire and their intended use; - a project plan and an assessment of needs for the following three years, if the applicant requires a larger block of numbering elements; and - justifications on the basis of which the applicant proves that it will use the allocated quantity of numbering elements in three years. AKOS must reach a decision on the allocation of numbering elements within 21 days from the beginning of the proceedings, provided that a public tender was not carried out. AKOS uses a public invitation to tender procedure only when it is established that efficient use of specific numbering elements (e.g., short numbers) can only be ensured by restricting the number of decisions issued allocating numbering elements. Operators that may allocate the numbering elements they acquire for use to their users under equal, cost oriented and transparent conditions may take part in a public invitation to tender procedure. Other natural person or legal entities may only take part if they can prove that they require numbering resources in order to perform an activity for the public benefit under the relevant legislation or EU regulations. AKOS shall decide on tenders by issuing one or more decisions on allocation of numbering elements, which it must in this case issue and deliver within 42 days of the expiry of the deadline for the submission of tenders. A holder of a decision on allocation of numbering elements must pay an annual fee to AKOS. The amount of the annual fee is based on quantity, length and type of numbering elements; however the amount should not restrict or hinder competition or market entry. Additionally, in the case of numbering elements awarded on the basis of a public tender, payment of a fee for effective use of a finite commodity is also required. The minimal amount of such payment and terms of payment shall be determined in the decision on the initiation of the public tender procedure. _Operators with Significant Market Power_ To prevent operators with significant market power (“OSMP”) from potentially abusing their market power on a relevant market (in particular, the market for public communication networks and the market for public communication services), AKOS may issue decisions designating operators as OSMPs and impose on them suitable measures or regulatory obligations (ex-ante regulation). The purpose of these measures is to regulate the relevant OSMP’s actions vis à vis other operators. The measures or obligations that may be imposed on an OSMP are set forth in ZEKom-1 and include the obligation to ensure transparency and equal treatment, the obligation to ensure operator access to and the use of specific network facilities, price control and cost accounting obligations, the obligation to separate accounting records, the obligation to regulate retail services, etc. The most severe measure envisaged by ZEKom-1 is a functional separation, which means that a vertically integrated OSMP must perform its activities related to operator access in a separate and independent business unit. Under ZEKom-1, an operator is deemed to have significant market power if it itself or together with other undertakings on a relevant market holds a dominant position, i.e., such economic influence as to enable it to exercise a considerable degree of independence in respect of its competitors, users and consumers. In assessing whether an operator has significant market power AKOS, among other things, considers the following criteria: - the market share of the operator on the relevant market and the variation of its market share on the relevant market over a longer period of time; - the existence of barriers to entry and their effect on the potential competition on that market; - the impact of large users on the power of the operator (countervailing purchasing power); - the elasticity of demand; - the stage of development of the relevant market; - technological advantages; - the development of sales and distribution networks; ----- - the achievement of scale or economies of integration; - the level of vertical integration; - the level of product differentiation; - the possibility of access to financial resources; - the control of infrastructure that may not easily be duplicated; and - the interconnection of services. The relevant markets are determined by AKOS taking into account principles of competition law and taking into account the valid European Commission recommendation on relevant product and service markets. The relevant markets listed in the valid European Commission recommendation of October 9, 2014 on relevant product and service markets within the electronic communications sector susceptible to ex-ante regulation in accordance with Directive 2002/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the European Council on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services (2014/710/EU) are: Market 1: Wholesale call termination on individual public telephone networks provided at a fixed location; Market 2: Wholesale voice call termination on individual mobile networks; Market 3a: Wholesale local access provided at a fixed location; Market 3b: Wholesale central access provided at a fixed location for mass market products; and Market 4: Wholesale high-quality access provided at a fixed location. In December 2020, the European Commission adopted a revised version of the recommendation on relevant product and service markets within the electronic communications sector susceptible to ex-ante regulation, replacing the European Commission recommendation on relevant products and service markets of October 9, 2014, as required by the European Electronic Communications Code. The new recommendation sets out a revised list of markets, which still warrant ex-ante regulation at the EU level, including two wholesale connectivity markets, i.e., Market 1: Wholesale local access provided at a fixed location and Market 2: Wholesale dedicated capacity. Other (previously listed as recommended) markets for wholesale central access as well as fixed and mobile voice call termination (listed in the preceding paragraph as Market 1, Market 2 and Market 3b) are no longer listed as markets susceptible to ex-ante regulation, however national regulatory authorities can always regulate these markets based on national circumstances and provided that the following test is met: (i) high and non-transitory barriers to entry, (ii) a structure that does not tend towards effective competition and (iii) competition law alone is insufficient to adequately address the identified market failures. It has not yet been publicly disclosed whether AKOS will impose ex-ante regulation measures only on the two listed markets, but we have received unofficial indication that AKOS intends to continue imposing ex-ante regulation on other markets as well. _Media Act_ The Media Act (Zakon o medijih—ZMed), which came into force on May 26, 2001 (as amended), prohibits a telecommunications operator from carrying out activities of a TV or radio broadcaster or advertiser, unless it has obtained an approval to perform TV and/or radio broadcasting activities from AKOS. In practice this means that entities engaging in telecommunication operations and entities carrying out activities of a TV or radio broadcaster or advertiser must be structurally separated (but may be under common control).",N/A,as_expected,2021,933
382_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1122,PRO-FORMA MAR 2021,1122.51,Regulatory Framework,1122.51.2,Serbia,"_General_ Under the Serbian Electronic Communication Act (“ECA”), the main piece of legislation regulating the performance of electronic communication activities and the operation of the networks thereof in Serbia, a company’s general authorization to conduct its business is in most cases sufficient to provide electronic communication services. A sector-specific license is required only if the business involves the exploitation of scarce resources, such as phone numbers or radio frequencies. Therefore, when a company takes up an activity under the general authorization regime, all it needs to do (subject to fulfillment of the imposed general conditions (technical and certain others) and payment of the prescribed fees) is to notify RATEL within 15-days of doing so. In addition, the company is required to act in compliance with general conditions during its operations and to notify RATEL of any important changes in its activities, as well as of their termination. ----- _Significant Market Power Under the ECA_ Under the ECA, an operator is considered to have significant market power (“SMP”), if it has, alone or together with other operators, a dominant position, i.e., a position that enables it to a significant degree to act independently from its competitors, subscribers and customers. Pursuant to the ECA, if RATEL finds the absence of effective competition in a relevant market (and a closely related market), it will designate the operator who, individually or jointly with other operators, has SMP on that market, by taking into account different market conditions. If RATEL reaches a decision designating one or more operators as having SMP, RATEL may impose at least one of the following obligations on the respective entities: - an obligation to publish data from accounting records, technical specifications, network characteristics, terms and conditions for supply and use or validity periods of the offer and prices; - an obligation to only engage in non-discriminatory conduct; - an obligation to keep separate accounts for interconnection and access services; - an obligation to provide access and use of parts of its network infrastructure and associated facilities to third parties; - price controls and cost-based accounting; - an obligation to make available a minimum set of leased lines; - an obligation to offer operator selection and operator pre-selection services; and - regulation of the respective operators’ retail services, including an obligation to unbundle products and services. _Tariffs_ As a general matter, each operator is free to set its own tariffs. However, if RATEL finds an operator to have SMP in a relevant market, the operator may become subject to various restrictions, including price controls, as noted above. If an operator becomes subject to price controls, it must adopt a cost based accounting system for the provision of specific types of interconnection and/or access services. These controls are imposed if, in particular, RATEL determines that the absence of effective competition enables the operator to charge exceedingly high prices or resort to price squeezes to the detriment of end-users. While RATEL has some flexibility in imposing these restrictions, it must take into consideration the previous investments made by the operator while imposing the aforesaid measures, it must encourage further investments and it must allow for a reasonable rate of return on investment in view of the risks involved. The burden of proof that an operator’s prices comply with the above-mentioned restrictions is on the relevant operator. Upon RATEL’s request, the operator in question is required to provide a detailed account of its pricing policy. A description of the operator’s price calculations must be made publicly available and reviewed annually by an independent auditor. _Law on Electronic Media_ Provision of audiovisual media services via electronic communication networks is subject to a license by the media regulator REM. Such license is valid for a period of eight calendar years and may be extended. In order to extend the term of the license, the licensee must submit a request for the extension of the license at least six months before its expiration. The holder of the license must notify REM of any change in its direct or indirect ownership structure for REM’s verification as to whether the change of control may lead to violation of the rules on media concentration (concentration of ownership or management rights in two or more electronic media publishers, or acquisition of more than 50% of share of daily news publishers with circulation of more than 50,000 copies annually, and audio and AVM service providers). Failure to abide by media concentration rules may lead to license revocation.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933
382_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1122,PRO-FORMA MAR 2021,1122.51,Regulatory Framework,1122.51.3,Bosnia and Herzegovina,"_Telecommunications Services_ The Bosnian Law on Communications regulates telecommunications, radio, broadcasting (including cable television) and associated services and facilities in Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as the establishment and the activities of the Bosnian Communications Regulatory Agency (“CRA”). ----- The CRA was established on March 2, 2001 and assumed the competences of the Independent Media Commission and the Telecommunications Regulatory Agency. The CRA is responsible for developing rules in the telecommunications and broadcasting sectors, the licensing of operators in these sectors, the planning, management and allocation of the frequency spectrum, the implementation of technical and quality standards and the determination and maintenance of license fees. Telecommunications services through fixed-line and mobile networks or internet services may only be offered if the relevant operator holds a license. A telecommunications operator is required to: - enter into written subscription contracts with its subscribers; - provide (free of charge) a brief and plain summary of the tariffs applicable to its subscribers; - deliver, at the request of the CRA, within a reasonable period of time, business data, network data and traffic data including confidential data; - ensure the proper functioning and good working condition of its system and the timely removal of interferences and failures and notify the CRA without any undue delay of any significant interruption in the telecommunications connections; - set up conditions of operation, a description of services and specify the relevant tariffs, all of which must be presented to the CRA and published in a suitable form; the operator must also publish any changes to the conditions of operations and tariffs at least one month prior to their effective date in a suitable form; any change to the content of a contract entitles the contracting party to terminate its contract with the telecommunications operator within a period of four weeks from the publication of the change; and - offer interconnection services to other operators upon their request; if the relevant parties cannot reach an agreement within a period of six weeks from receipt of the request, each of them may petition the CRA to mediate the dispute. The CRA decides upon the grant of a telecommunications license within two months of receiving an appropriate application. In the event of competitive or comparative selection procedures the CRA may extend the evaluation period for up to four months to ensure that such procedures are fair, reasonable, open, nondiscriminatory and transparent to all interested parties. The CRA will grant a license if the applicant possesses the necessary technical competence and if there is no reason to assume that the applicant will not provide the relevant services in accordance with the license, in particular as regards quality and supply. In reaching its decision, the CRA takes into consideration the applicant’s financial strength, its experience in the telecommunications sector and related sectors as well as its relevant expertise. A licensee may transfer its license in whole or in part only with the consent of the CRA, which defines the conditions for the transfer of the license. _Operators with Significant Market Power_ A telecommunications operator with significant market power must allow third parties to access its public telecommunications network or unbundled parts of such network. The obligation related to interconnection does not apply if the CRA determines, based on evidence provided by the telecommunications operator, that it would be inappropriate to require the operator to open its network. A telecommunications operator with significant market power requires the CRA’s approval to provide (i) voice telephony services via a fixed-line or mobile network and (ii) leased lines. In addition, a telecommunications operator with significant market power in the telecommunications market is required to provide to its competitors open and non-discriminatory access to its services, establish a cost accounting system that assigns costs to all of its services and permits subsequent audits of this system in compliance with the CRA rules and the provisions set out in the licenses, and provide a minimum set of lines for lease to third parties. Such an operator is also prohibited from cross subsidizing services and is subject to accounting separation of interconnection activities. In addition, a provider of public fixed-line telephony services that has been designated as an operator of telecommunications with significant market power on the market of fixed-line public telephony services must enable unbundled access to the local loop and related facilities on the basis of the following principles: objectivity, transparency, non-discrimination and cost orientation and is subject to price control. _Audiovisual Media Services_ The provision of audiovisual media services is subject to a license by the CRA. Such services must be provided on a non-discriminatory basis and in accordance with the law and the terms of the license. A licensee may not restrict access to subscribers based on their nationality, religious beliefs, financial strength or any other ----- grounds nor is it entitled to make a selection of programs in a manner that favors the interests of only one national or religious community in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The licensee is required to offer the services to all citizens in the technical coverage zone and each person that accepts the single and non-discriminatory conditions is entitled to enter into a subscription contract. Prior to the inclusion of any audiovisual media service or a radio media service into a service package, the licensee is required to obtain written consents from the owners of the program content or their authorized representatives. The distribution of such services cannot be launched before the relevant consents have been obtained. A license for the provision of audiovisual media services is valid for a period of ten calendar years and may be extended. In order to extend the term of the license, the licensee must submit a request for extension of the license at least three-months before its expiration. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

(2) Unique cable subscribers represent the number of individual end-users who have subscribed to one or more of our cable-based services. In all of our cable markets, cable Pay-TV is the basic service that a cable unique subscriber is typically required to subscribe to in order to receive the Group’s other services such as broadband internet access and telephony, with the exception of Bulgaria. A unique cable subscriber may subscribe to several different services, thereby accounting for only one unique cable subscriber, but several RGUs. (3) Cable Pay-TV RGUs includes (i) the sum of our analog and digital cable Pay-TV RGUs in Slovenia, (ii) our total analog cable Pay-TV RGUs (without separately counting analog cable RGUs that have purchased digital top ups) in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro and (iii) our analog and digital cable Pay-TV RGUs in Bulgaria. (4) OTT consists of our NetTV Plus and out of footprint EON subscribers. (5) Broadband internet RGUs represents residential broadband internet provided within our network footprint. (6) Fixed-line telephony RGUs represents residential fixed-line telephony provided within our network footprint. (7) Mobile RGUs represents mobile-telephony services provided to customers in Slovenia, where we have operated as an MNO since our acquisition of Tušmobil in April 2015. Following completion of the acquisition of Tele2 Croatia in March 2020, we also provide mobile-telephony services in Croatia, and following the completion of the acquisition of Vivacom in July 2020, we also provide mobile-telephony services in Bulgaria. (8) Other services include multichannel multipoint distribution service-based services, ADSL internet services and B2B services. (9) RGU Penetration represents for cable Pay-TV the number of unique cable subscribers at the end of the relevant period as a percentage of the number of homes passed by our network, and for broadband internet the number of RGUs at the end of the relevant period as a percentage of the number of unique cable subscribers. ----- (10) Blended Cable ARPU is calculated by adding together, for each month in a given period, the total cable Pay-TV, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony revenues (including fixed-line telephony usage revenues and excluding minor installation fees) for that particular month divided by the average number of unique cable subscribers for that month and then dividing that sum by the total number of months in the period. Blended Cable ARPU does not include mobile ARPU, which was €10.9 for the year ended December 31, 2018, €10.8 for the year ended December 31, 2019, €9.5 for the year ended December 31, 2020, €11.0 for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and €8.8 for the three months ended March 31, 2021. We calculate mobile ARPU by adding together, for each month in a given period, the total mobile-telephony revenues (excluding revenues generated by customers of other networks roaming on our network and excluding wholesale revenues) for that particular month divided by the average number of mobile RGUs for that month and then dividing that sum by the total number of months in the period. In addition, following the Vivacom Acquisition, we amended the definition of certain key operating measures (Homes Passed, Unique Cable Subscribers and Blended Cable ARPU) in order to align the calculation methodology across the Group. As a result, Bended Cable ARPU figures were restated for the periods starting from January 1, 2018 onwards. (11) As of January 1, 2019, we changed our reporting methodology in regards to certain key operating measures, which has resulted in immaterial differences as compared to previous periods. For the year ended December 31, 2018, OTT users on our network have been reclassified to Cable and Cable services users on other networks have been reclassified to Other Services from Cable. This change has an immaterial effect on all subscriber, RGU, ARPU and churn data for the year ended December 31, 2018, and such key operating measures have been restated for such periods in line with this new reporting methodology.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

When SBB Serbia sells this equipment to other United Group companies in compliance with applicable transfer pricing requirements, it makes an unrealized profit on the sale. These unrealized profits are eliminated for the purposes of preparing our accounts in accordance with IFRS, but are not eliminated for the purpose of our management accounts. Assets held for sale relate to programming rights acquired by our Media Group segment for other Group segments which were recognized under IFRS as intangible assets and were invoiced to other Group segments after March 31, 2021. The application of IFRS 15 for acquisition costs in SBB Serbia reflects the additional effect of harmonizing our accounting policy with respect to the capitalization of subscriber acquisition costs for rebinding, upselling and cross-selling (which in the past were not eligible to be capitalized, but under IFRS 15 qualify for capitalization), which were determined subsequent to the preparation of our management accounts. Overflow between periods relates to the fact that our management accounts are closed prior to the closing of our accounts prepared in accordance with IFRS. Overflow between periods in any given period reflects the additional capital expenditure incurred between the preparation of our management accounts and our accounts prepared in accordance with IFRS for such period.

We present UG EBITDA and the ratios derived therefrom, because we believe that they are measures commonly used by investors and they are measures that we use in managing our business. UG EBITDA, as presented in this offering memorandum, however, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in the way these measures are calculated. See “Presentation of Financial Data—Non-IFRS Financial and Operating Data.” (3) UG Adjusted EBITDA represents UG EBITDA, adjusted for certain exceptional items, such as shareholder related costs, impairment charges, M&A related costs and group restructuring costs, which the Group views as non-operating. Management believes that excluding these components provides useful information to investors and others in evaluating the Company’s operating performance, financing structure and understanding the performance of our core business described below for each of the periods presented.

(2) Mobile subscribers are reported based on the number of active mobile SIM cards. In line with the prevailing methodology in Bulgaria for calculating post-paid mobile subscribers, post-paid mobile subscribers are counted in the subscriber base as long as they have an active contract, have an active billing status (i.e., subscribers who regularly pay their bills) and have not been disconnected from the network, which includes machine to machine connections. Pre-paid mobile subscribers are counted in the ----- subscriber base in line with the prevailing methodology for doing so in the Bulgarian mobile telecommunications market, whereby pre-paid mobile subscribers are counted in the subscriber base if they have had an activity event (such as outgoing and incoming customer generated usage or recharge) within the last 90 days. (3) Fixed-telephony subscribers are counted in the subscriber base as long as they have an active billing status (i.e., subscribers who regularly pay their bills). Subscribers are counted in channels: PSTN = 1; ISDN BRA = 2; ISDN PRA; and R2D = 30 channels. (4) Fixed broadband subscribers are reported based on technical installations and the number of subscribers who have an active billing status (subscribers who regularly pay their bills). (5) Fixed Pay-TV subscribers are reported based on technical installations and the number of subscribers who have an active billing status (subscribers who regularly pay their bills). (6) Blended mobile ARPU is defined as the sum of the monthly mobile services revenue in the period, divided by the average number of mobile subscribers in the period, divided by the number of months in that period. The average number of mobile subscribers during a period is calculated by adding together the number of active mobile SIM cards at the beginning and end of each month during the period, dividing by two and then averaging the results from all months during the period. For purposes of calculating blended mobile ARPU, mobile services revenue consist of revenue generated from monthly subscription fees, usage fees for services that are incremental to the services allocated with the monthly subscription fees and mobile interconnect revenue (i.e., from fees paid to us by other operators for calls terminated on Vivacom’s mobile network, including roaming charges by Vivacom’s customers) as well as the expired balance revenue for pre-paid SIM cards, but does not include revenue such as revenue generated from mobile handset sales and revenue from roaming charges incurred by customers of other operators using Vivacom’s network. The blended mobile ARPU presented above in euro was converted from Bulgarian levs using the rate of BGN 1.9558 per €1.00, which is the rate at which the Bulgarian lev is pegged to the euro. (7) Fixed-telephony ARPU is defined as the sum of the monthly fixed-telephony revenue in the period, divided by the average number of fixed-telephony subscribers in the period, divided by the number of months in that period. The average number of fixedtelephony subscribers in a period is calculated by adding together the number of fixed-telephony subscribers at the beginning and end of each month during the period, dividing by two and then averaging the results from all months during the period. For purposes of calculating fixed-telephony ARPU, fixed-telephony revenue includes revenue generated from monthly subscription fees, usage fees for services that are incremental to the services allocated with monthly subscription fees and landline termination rates (i.e., fees paid by other operators for calls terminated on Vivacom’s landline network), but does not include revenue generated from wholesale voice. The fixed-telephony ARPU presented above in euro was converted from Bulgarian levs using the rate of BGN 1.9558 per €1.00, which is the rate at which the Bulgarian lev is pegged to the euro. (8) Fixed broadband ARPU is defined as the sum of the monthly fixed broadband revenue in the period, divided by the average number of fixed broadband subscribers in the period, divided by the number of months in that period. The average number of fixed broadband subscribers in a period is calculated by adding together the number of fixed broadband subscribers at the beginning and end of each month during the period, dividing by two and then averaging the results from all months during the period. For purposes of calculating fixed broadband ARPU, fixed broadband revenue includes revenue generated from monthly subscription fees but does not include dial up revenue, revenue from the sale of customer premises equipment, such as modems and initial set up charges and revenue generated from the provision of business data and connectivity solutions such as VPN and MAN services. The fixed broadband ARPU presented above in euro was converted from Bulgarian levs using the rate of BGN 1.9558 per €1.00, which is the rate at which the Bulgarian lev is pegged to the euro. (9) Fixed Pay-TV ARPU is defined as the sum of the monthly fixed Pay-TV revenue in the period (IPTV and DTH), divided by the average number of fixed Pay-TV subscribers (IPTV and DTH) in the period, divided by the number of months in that period. The average number of fixed Pay-TV subscribers in a period is calculated by adding together the number of fixed Pay-TV subscribers at the beginning and end of each month during the period, dividing by two and then averaging the results from all months during the period. For purposes of calculating fixed Pay-TV ARPU, fixed Pay-TV revenue includes revenue generated from monthly subscription fees and packages with additional content. The fixed Pay-TV ARPU presented above in euro was converted from Bulgarian levs using the rate of BGN 1.9558 per €1.00, which is the rate at which the Bulgarian lev is pegged to the euro. (10) As of the end of 2018, Vivacom changed its reporting methodology for fixed wireless broadband (Mobix) subscribers, which were reclassified and presented as mobile subscribers. The reclassification has impacted subscribers, RGU and ARPU. Previous periods have been restated in line with this new reporting methodology.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Financial information for the seven months ended July 31, 2020 is derived by taking the financial data for nine months ended September 30, 2020, and subtracting the financial information for the two months ended September 30, 2020 (which has not been reviewed or audited). The financial information is prepared in Bulgarian levs (BGN). (b) Amounts were converted using the BGN/EUR exchange rate of BGN 1.9558 to EUR 1.00, the pegged rate for the period. (c) The adjustments presented have been made to reclassify Vivacom line items to conform to the Company’s basis of preparation. Such adjustments have no effect on profit for the period reported. (d) The purpose of the adjustment is to illustrate the effects of: (i) eliminating the effect of transactions between Vivacom and Viva Telecom Bulgaria EOOD The Group acquired Viva Telecom Bulgaria EOOD (formerly, Viva Telecom Bulgaria OOD) in the Vivacom Acquisition. Viva Telecom Bulgaria EOOD is a holding company of the Vivacom Group but does not itself prepare consolidated financial information. The pro forma financial information of Vivacom included herein is based on the Vivacom Unaudited Interim Financial Statements and therefore certain adjustments are made to eliminate the effect of transactions between Vivacom and Viva Telecom Bulgaria EOOD. An adjustment was made to eliminate intercompany transactions, comprising an interest income amounting to €6,262 thousand and reversal of impairment cost amounting to €303 thousand and related tax effects. (ii) purchase price allocation The purchase price allocation was finalized as of December 31, 2020 and therefore the Company Audited Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, include the fair value adjustments that have been made to acquired assets and liabilities (including any associated deferred tax effects), and differences between total consideration paid for the acquisition and the estimated fair values of the net assets of Vivacom were recorded as goodwill. The Company identified and measured significant identifiable assets such as: trade name, customer base—fixed services, customer base—mobile services, licenses, software and distribution network. The value of the items of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets increased significantly. As a result of the newly identified intangible assets and the significant increase to the value of the existing items of property, plant and equipment, additional amortization and depreciation charges were estimated and added as adjustments to the of Vivacom financial data for the seven months ended July 31, 2020. The amount of additional amortization and depreciation was estimated based on the value allocated to specific assets and the remaining useful life of ----- those assets. The adjustments for the additional amortization and depreciation charges are amounting to €44,382 thousand and related tax benefit amounting to €4,438 thousand. (e) The adjustments presented have been made to align Vivacom’s accounting policies with IFRS as adopted and applied by the Company under its currently applied accounting policies. Vivacom (i) capitalizes subscriber acquisition costs for contracts below one year and (ii) capitalizes portability costs, while such costs are expensed as incurred by the Company and (iii) for related tax effects of the foregoing.

For a detailed description of the basis of presentation with respect to the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial data for the Group, see “Presentation of Financial Data” and “Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information.” The summary unaudited pro forma financial data is based on available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable. The summary unaudited pro forma financial data is presented for illustrative purposes_ ----- _only and is not intended to represent or be indicative of the results of operations that we would have reported had the Vivacom Transactions actually occurred during the period presented, and the summary unaudited pro forma financial data does not purport to project our results of operations for any future period. The summary unaudited pro forma financial data has not been prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act, the EU Prospectus Regulation or any generally accepted accounting standards. For more information, please refer to “Presentation of Financial Data” and “Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information.” We also present certain other Non-IFRS Measures below, which are listed in “Presentation of Financial Data— Financial Data Included in This Offering Memorandum—Non-IFRS Financial and Operating Data.” These measures are presented in this offering memorandum because we believe that they and similar measures are widely used in the telecommunications industry as a means of evaluating a company’s operating performance and financing structure. These measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and are not measurements under IFRS or other generally accepted accounting principles, and you should not consider such items as alternatives to net income (loss), operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS, and they may be different from similarly titled measures used by other companies. Our management believes this data, along with comparable IFRS measures, is useful to investors because it provides a basis for measuring the operating performance in the periods presented. These measures are used in the internal management of our business, along with the most directly comparable IFRS financial measures, in evaluating the operating performance. Non-IFRS measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results or any performance measures under IFRS as set forth in the Company Audited Financial Statements, the Company Unaudited Interim Financial Statements, the Vivacom Audited Financial Statements or the Vivacom Unaudited Interim Financial Statements. For more information, see “Presentation of Financial Data.” Prospective investors should read the summary data presented below in conjunction with “Presentation of Financial Data,” “Use of Proceeds,” “Capitalization,” “The Company’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” “Vivacom’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” the Company Audited Financial Statements, the Vivacom Audited Financial Statements, the Company Unaudited Interim Financial Statements and the Vivacom Unaudited Interim Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum._ -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

The nature and level of the competition we face varies for each of the products and services we offer and by region, but we generally compete on the basis of quality of content, network quality, marketing, product and service portfolio specifications, customer care, sales and marketing services as well as price. Our competitors include, but are not limited to, television providers, including providers using alternative and emerging digital technologies such as Internet Protocol Television (“IPTV”) and OTT content owners; DTH-TV providers; broadband internet and telephony services providers; public switched telephone network (“PSTN”) or fiber connections; and in Slovenia, Bulgaria and Croatia, other MNOs, including those using LTE technology. In addition, continued consolidation within the media industry may allow more competitors to offer bundles of digital television, fixed-line telephony, mobile-telephony and broadband services, and consolidation by competitors could allow them to benefit from economies of scale that we do not have. As a result, we may compete against companies with easier access to financing, more comprehensive product offerings, greater personnel resources, greater brand name recognition and experience or longer established relationships with regulatory authorities and customers, resulting in fewer regulatory burdens with which they are required to comply. Communications technologies and consumer electronics, as well as the way information, communication and entertainment is offered, are constantly changing, and the impact of such changes can be difficult to predict. Current and future competitors may expand their product and service offering more rapidly or adapt to new or emerging technologies more quickly than us (for example Telekom Srbija in Serbia and M:TEL in Montenegro have quickly upgraded their GPON platforms), or may offer their products and services at a lower price than ours, for example, where our services are priced at the high end of the market, which could cause us to lose subscribers, force us to lower our prices or otherwise adversely affect the margin of profit we are able to achieve from our services. In particular, we face the following risks in relation to each of our product offerings:",N/A,as_expected,2021,933
382_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.2,Television,"While competition among cable Pay-TV providers in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina is currently low due to minimal cable overbuild, we face competition in the Serbian television market from other methods of television services distribution, such as DTH and IPTV. Our main competitor in Serbia is the state-owned incumbent Telekom Srbija. During 2018 and 2019, Telekom Srbija purchased several independent cable operators, offering Pay-TV, telephony and internet services, as well as the DTH users of Polaris Media, a Serbian DTH platform, strengthening Telekom Srbija’s presence in the Serbian market. Our main Pay-TV competitor in Bosnia and Herzegovina is the incumbent in the ethnic region in which we operate, BH Telecom. Competition in the Pay-TV market in Slovenia is strong, particularly for the provision of Fiber to the Home (“FttH”) services between Telekom Slovenije and T2, especially in metropolitan areas. Our main competitors in the Slovenian Pay-TV market are Telekom Slovenije, T2 and A1. Competition in Montenegro is strong, and the primary competitors are Crnogorski Telekom (IPTV and Fiber to the × (“FTTx”)) and M:TEL (FTTx and HFC). Both operators have a very large market share and a large number of users. Following the completion of the Vivacom Acquisition, we also compete with A1 Bulgaria and Bulsatcom for offering Pay-TV services in Bulgaria. Both of these competitors have larger market shares by number of subscribers than Vivacom, which may make it difficult for us to build our Pay-TV subscriber base. Additionally, we face increased competition from non-traditional television services based on new internet technologies, including OTT television services, which have increased in number and quality over the past few years. OTT television services deliver Pay-TV content “on top” of an existing broadband internet connection directly to a television, PC, laptop, tablet or mobile devices. OTT service providers leverage existing ----- infrastructures and are often not required to implement capital intensive models associated with traditional data providers like us. We cannot rule out that increased availability of OTT content as well as advances in broadband and mobile internet connection speeds will lead to increased competition from OTT providers in the future.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933
382_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.3,Fixed Broadband Internet,"Although we continue to hold stable market shares in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, we face strong competition in these markets from other broadband internet services, such as ADSL and VDSL broadband connections and FttH providers. Our main competitors for broadband internet services are Telekom Srbija in Serbia and BH Telecom and Telecom RS in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In Bulgaria, we also compete with A1 Bulgaria and Bulsatcom. Continued upgrades from DSL based broadband internet service to FttH, such as the optical network that has been constructed in Serbia by Telekom Srbija, and more widespread FttH installations could have a negative impact on our competitive position in the broadband internet market. Due to extensive overbuild and high levels of broadband internet penetration in Slovenia, we face significant competition in the broadband internet market segment from fiber broadband internet providers such as Telekom Slovenije, T2 and A1. In particular, we compete against Telekom Slovenije’s optical network services. Moreover, mobile operators are increasingly able to utilize a combination of powerful handsets and high bandwidth technologies such as 5G and LTE technologies. Additional competition may come from satellite technologies and operators that use microwave access (“WiMax”) technologies. In the Montenegrin broadband internet market, Crnogorski Telekom utilizes FTTx, ADSL and VDSL broadband, and M:TEL currently utilizes HFC, which will soon replace FTTx on its network.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

We believe that the Slovenian telephony market is relatively mature and market share changes are mainly driven by the combination of the price and quality of the services provided by bundled offerings. Our main competitors in Slovenia are Telekom Slovenije, T2, and A1, and our main competitors in Montenegro are the incumbent operator, Crnogorski Telekom, and M: Tel. In addition, in Bulgaria, we compete in the fixed-line telephony market predominantly with A1 Bulgaria, which, in addition to Vivacom, is the only other fully converged telecommunications operator in Bulgaria. Further, we operate in an industry that is affected by fixed-line to mobile-telephony substitution, and as a result there may be decreased demand for our fixed-line telephony services. We may be affected in each of the markets in which we operate by providers of free Voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) services such as Apple’s FaceTime service or WhatsApp which have considerably improved their speech quality over the last few years and can be accessed from any device connected to the internet, including smartphones.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933
382_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.5,Mobile-Telephony,"Following our acquisition of Tušmobil in April 2015, we began providing mobile-telephony services in Slovenia as an MNO, and following completion of the Vivacom Acquisition and Tele2 Croatia Acquisition, we began providing mobile-telephony services in Bulgaria and Croatia, respectively, as an MNO. Accordingly, we face strong competition for subscribers from established competitors, including, in particular, Telekom Slovenije and A1 Telekom Austria in Slovenia, A1 Bulgaria and Telenor in Bulgaria and Croatian Telecom, A1 Croatia and T Mobile Croatia, as well as other mobile telecommunications that may enter the Slovenian, Bulgarian or Croatian mobile markets (such as Hofer Telekom, which recently entered the Slovenian mobile market). Certain competitors have undertaken or announced intentions to undertake acquisitions in the mobile telecommunications markets in which we operate. PPF Group, a private investment group in Europe, completed its acquisition of the telecommunications assets of Telenor Group in Serbia, Montenegro, Hungary and Bulgaria in July 2018. Any other planned acquisitions by competitors, if consummated, could negatively impact our business, such as by reducing our market share or forcing us to undertake more capital expenditure or to lower prices. To the extent we were to lose market share to any competitors, our revenues may decline. If we fail to increase our market share in line with our expectations, we will be less profitable, which will adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In Bulgaria, the mobile market has stabilized as the three main market participants are of roughly equal size and have all shifted to a value for money strategy, which may hinder our ability to differentiate ourselves and our ability to grow our market share. Additionally, ----- in each of the markets in which we compete, our competitors may improve their ability to attract new subscribers, or provide their offerings or services at lower prices to increase their respective market shares, which would make it more difficult for us to retain our current subscribers or expand our subscriber base without us lowering our prices or increasing our subscriber retention cost. In order to compete, we may have to lower prices, which may reduce our margins and/or increase our marketing and promotional expenses, each of which may cause our operating profit to decline significantly.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Many of our competitors, including Telekom Slovenije in Slovenia, Telekom Srbija in Serbia, Telecom RS, HT Eronet and BH Telecom in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Crnogorski Telekom and M:TEL in Montenegro, offer bundled packages of services. Several of these bundles include mobile phone services, which we offer in Slovenia, Bulgaria and Croatia.

Shoppster’s key competitors include, among others, e-commerce platforms such as E Kupi in Serbia and Mimovrste, EnaA, Big Bang, Merkur and Piazz in Slovenia, as well as traditional retail stores such as Gigatron and Tehnomanija in Serbia. Increased competition, or any inability to provide cable and DTH Pay-TV, broadband internet and telephony services at competitive prices, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

See “—Any outbreak of severe communicable _diseases, including COVID-19, may materially affect our business and results of operations.” In addition, our_ ability to grow or maintain our business may be adversely affected by the impact of state implemented austerity measures. For example, in 2014, the Serbian government implemented austerity measures, including increased rates of taxation and a reduction in public sector wages, which if continued or adopted in our other markets, could continue to have an impact on our customers’disposable income in Serbia or our other markets. As customers may view spending for most of our services, such as Pay-TV, as discretionary, the risks associated with certain segments of our business become more acute in periods of a slowing economy or recession as consumers may delay purchasing decisions or reduce or reallocate their discretionary funds. Current customers may elect to downgrade their packages or move to less costly providers, and new customers may opt to take out our lower end broadband and Pay-TV packages rather than more expensive ones or may opt to become customers of less costly competitors, or not to subscribe to Pay-TV services at all. We are also exposed to risks associated with the potential financial instability of our customers, many of whom may be adversely affected by a general economic downturn. This may lead to a higher number of non-paying subscribers. Suppliers and distributors may also be more cautious in supplying goods to us and may request additional credit enhancements or more restrictive payment terms. While the impact of an economic slowdown on our business is difficult to predict, it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and our cash flow.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933
382_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.9,Our operating results will be adversely affected if we cannot generate strong advertising sales.,"We generate revenue from the sale of advertising on or in our television stations and broadcast and cable networks. Expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions, as well as budgeting and buying patterns. A decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general, including as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the relevant responses taken by the governments of the countries in which we operate, could alter current or prospective advertisers’ spending priorities as well ----- as advertising pricing. See “—Any outbreak of severe communicable diseases, including COVID-19, may _materially affect our business and results of operations.” For the three months ended March 31, 2021, our_ advertising sales increased by 182% as compared to the same period in 2020 mainly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact in the same period in 2020. Demand for our products is also a factor in determining advertising rates. For example, ratings points for our television stations and broadcast and cable networks are factors that are weighed when determining advertising rates, and with respect to our television stations and broadcast and television networks, when determining the affiliate rates received by us. In addition, newer technologies, including new video formats, streaming and downloading capabilities via the internet, video on demand, personal video recorders and other devices and technologies are increasing the number of media and entertainment choices available to audiences. Some of these devices and technologies allow users to view television or films from a remote location or on a time delayed basis and provide users the ability to fast forward, rewind, pause and skip programming and advertisements. These technological developments could affect the attractiveness of our offerings to viewers, advertisers and/or distributors. Failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging technologies or changes in consumer behavior could have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, a decrease in advertising expenditures, reduced demand for our offerings or the inability to obtain market ratings that adequately measure demand for our content on personal video recorders and mobile devices could lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933
382_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.10,"We have made and may make acquisitions or enter into transactions that may present unforeseen risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction and, additionally, there are risks associated with the integration of any acquisitions.","As part of our business strategy, we pursue strategic and opportunistic acquisitions of service providers, content providers and cable assets. Any of these transactions could be material to our financial condition or results of operations. Despite our successful track record, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue making such acquisitions and our ability to acquire new businesses may be limited by many factors, including availability of financing, debt covenants, complex ownership structures among potential targets and government regulation and competition from other potential acquirers. In addition, our debt burden may increase if we borrow funds to finance any future acquisition, which could have a negative impact on our cash flows and our ability to finance our overall operations and make cash interest payments on the New Notes. Even if we are successful in acquiring new businesses, the integration of such businesses, including the integration of Vivacom, may prove to be more difficult than we initially anticipated and could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Acquisitions pose certain risks, for example, difficulties or delays in consolidating operations and achieving anticipated synergies, cost savings, revenues and cash flow enhancements, growth, operational efficiencies and other benefits; diversion of managerial resources away from our day-to-day business operations; potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities to the extent that we issue new shares to fund an acquisition; and the assumption of unexpected liabilities and undisclosed risks. Following the Vivacom Acquisition, we expect to realize certain operational efficiency and cost saving measures. We may not be able to realize these measures, either in the amount or within the timeframe that we currently anticipate, and the costs of achieving these measures may be higher than what we expect. Our ability to realize such operational efficiency and cost savings measures may be affected by a number of factors, including increases in expenses related to the Vivacom Acquisition. In addition, the Vivacom Acquisition has required, and will likely continue to require, substantial time and focus from management, which could adversely affect their ability to operate our business. These factors may offset the expected cost savings from the Vivacom Acquisition. In addition, the Vivacom Acquisition will result in a significant proportion of our operations, assets and revenues deriving from Bulgaria. Bulgaria borders Serbia and North Macedonia, but it has a different language, culture and history compared to the jurisdictions in which we currently operate. We may encounter unexpected difficulties that could impact the successful integration of Vivacom in ways that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Vivacom and/or its subsidiaries may have liabilities that we failed or were unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations in connection with the Vivacom Acquisition. In addition, the extent of liabilities we discovered in connection after the Vivacom Acquisition may be greater than we expected. There may be unknown or contingent liabilities and issues relating to compliance with applicable laws and regulations. For example, we could become liable for overdue payables of Vivacom and/or its subsidiaries to suppliers and employees that are not currently known to us, or we could become subject to tax or pension liabilities in respect of historical periods that we are not currently aware of or the amount of ----- which we underestimated, or we could become liable in relation to past or pending disputes involving Vivacom and/or its subsidiaries that are not currently known to us, or we could suffer losses relating to issues in title or required permits for the real estate property owned and/or used by Vivacom and/or its subsidiaries that are not currently known to us. In conducting our due diligence, we were required to rely on resources available to us, including public information, information provided by the seller and third-party consultants and advisers. There can be no assurance that the due diligence we undertook has revealed or highlighted all relevant facts necessary or helpful in evaluating the Vivacom Acquisition. Any such unknown or previously underestimated liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the New Notes. The Forthnet Acquisition and the integration of Forthnet also involves certain significant risks, in particular since Forthnet, as a MVNO that in general relies on other providers’ networks, is subject to significant regulatory and competitive risks that could impact the results of operations and financial condition of Forthnet and, therefore, our Group. Similarly, the Optima Telekom Acquisition and the integration of Optima Telekom involves certain significant risks. In particular, completion of the Optima Telekom Acquisition is subject to various conditions, including the implementation of certain changes in the current Croatian telecommunication legislation relating to vertical integration between pay-TV broadcasters and distributors. There can be no assurance that these legislative changes will be implemented by the Croatian and therefore we may not be able to complete the Optima Telekom Acquisition by the end of 2021 as currently expected or at all. Furthermore, certain contracts of the businesses acquired by us contain “change of control” provisions that require the acquired company to notify the counterparty of a potential change of control, or contain language that could be interpreted as allowing, subject to certain conditions, the counterparty to terminate the contract following a change of control. In particular, the Vivacom Acquisition constitutes a change of control under certain agreements entered into by Vivacom and its subsidiaries, such as commercial agreements with some of its suppliers, and entitles these third parties to terminate their agreements with Vivacom or, in some cases, request adjustments of the terms of the agreements. Nova BG and Optima Telekom are also party to certain agreements with international television content providers which contain change of control clauses. The Optima Telekom Acquisition may also constitute a change of control under certain agreements. Although the agreements governing certain of our acquisitions require the target to use commercially reasonable endeavors to obtain consents or waivers relating to such “change of control” provisions prior to closing of the acquisitions, such consents and waivers are generally not a condition to closing. If a substantial number of these contracts have been, are or will be terminated as a result of our acquisition, we may be forced to enter into new contracts on less favorable terms, or we may be unable to secure replacements. While we strive to mitigate unexpected liabilities and risks though contractual protections in our acquisition documentation, we cannot ensure that such protections will be effective. For example, although the share sale and purchase agreement pursuant to which we acquired Tušmobil contains warranties related to, among other things, compliance with laws, licenses and consents and financial crime, and provides, subject to certain qualifications and limitations, for indemnification from the seller in the event of breach of warranties, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in any claims that we may bring for breach of warranties based on the agreement or that any recovery made under this agreement would cover the potential losses arising out of any such breach. If we enter into an acquisition agreement, but the acquisition is not consummated, we may be liable for break-up fees or other payments, which may, in some cases, be material. The agreement with respect to the Nova TV Croatia Acquisition does not provide us an indemnity in the event of potential remedies related to any ongoing litigation and investigations resulting from the completion of such acquisition. In connection with the Direct Media/Pink Acquisition, Ascanius Netherlands B.V. has given certain indemnities and customary representations and warranties. In connection with the Nova TV Croatia Acquisition, CME B.V. has given certain customary representations and warranties related to Nova TV Croatia. The Vivacom Acquisition Agreement, the Tele2 Croatia Acquisition Agreement and the agreements for the Forthnet Acquisition, the Nova Broadcasting Group Acquisition and the Optima Telekom Acquisition also contain certain indemnities and customary representations and warranties. There can be no assurance that we will be able to enforce any claims relating to breaches of such representations and warranties, and CME B.V.’s liability, in respect of the Nova TV Croatia Acquisition, the Vivacom Seller’s liability, with respect to the Vivacom Acquisition, and Tele2 Sverige AB’s liability, with respect to the Tele2 Croatia Acquisition, and the respective sellers for the Forthnet Acquisition, the Nova Broadcasting Group Acquisition and the Optima Telekom Acquisition, with respect to breaches of their representations and warranties, is limited. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Past acquisitions by the Group, including recent acquisitions, are or may become subject to review by competition authorities within the relevant jurisdictions. Such competition authorities may take the position that merger control filings were required, and should we fail to meet such requests or requirements in a timely manner, the relevant governmental authority may impose fines and, if in connection with a merger transaction, may require corrective measures, such as mandatory disposition of assets or divestiture of operations. For example, in the past, relevant competition authorities in Serbia and Slovenia have challenged a number of our acquisitions, in some cases resulting in a requirement of divestiture or the levying of fines, which can be substantial. See “Our Business—Legal Proceedings.” The completion of the Optima Telekom Acquisition is subject to a condition relating to the implementation of certain changes in current Croatian telecommunication legislation. We also may be subject to challenges brought by certain of our competitors. For example, on April 29, 2021, Vivacom acquired local broadband and television operators Net 1 EOOD, ComNet Sofia EAD and Digital Cable Television EOOD. These transactions were approved by the Bulgarian Commission on Protection of Competition (“CPC”). On April 29, 2021, however, Telenor Bulgaria challenged the CPC’s approval relating to these transactions before the Administrative Court—Sofia District. Vivacom has intervened in support of the CPC’s decision. If the Administrative Court—Sofia District annuls the CPC’s approvals, and the annulment is upheld by the Supreme Administrative Court, the CPC will re-examine the transactions (which have already been completed).

The commercial success of a television program also depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing television programming released into the marketplace at or near the same time, the availability of a growing number of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities, general economic conditions and their effects on consumer spending and other tangible and intangible factors, all of which can change and cannot be predicted with certainty. Audience ratings for a television program are generally a key factor in generating revenues from other distribution channels, such as content licensing. Given the production costs that are incurred prior to airing a new television program, the profitability of television production and the recovery of upfront costs depend on the program’s popularity upon and following the initial airing. A decline in the ratings or popularity of our entertainment, sports or news television programming, which could be a result of the loss of talent or rights to certain programming, could adversely affect advertising revenues in the near term and, over a longer period of time, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

We depend on our agreements, relationships and cooperation with third parties for the majority of our content. We receive content for our cable and DTH Pay-TV services pursuant to licenses with content owners, including high-quality regional and international television networks such as FOX, ViaSat and Universal channels. Additionally, we produce our own content through our in-house content company. While we intend to negotiate additional access to continue to expand our Pay-TV product range, rights to premium or high definition (“HD”) content may in the future be obtained by our competitors on an exclusive basis and therefore not be available to us. Additionally, we may be unable to secure content on an exclusive ----- basis and may have to share broadcasting rights with our competitors, which could lead to a dilution of our brand name. Furthermore, our competitors may be able to secure content which is more popular than ours, and changes in our subscribers’content preferences could result in a decrease of the popularity of our content and an increase in the popularity of that of our competitors. While we have successfully developed our video on demand and other interactive services as well as our own television content in the past, our ability to source content will be increasingly important and will depend on our ability to maintain relationships and cooperation with content owners and broadcasters for both standard and HD content as well as our ability to accurately predict our customers’ content preferences. Furthermore, our NetTV Plus OTT content platform, which distributes local ethnic content to former Yugoslav expats around the world, relies on the availability of a number of local free-to-air channels and no fee contracts for the distribution of such content. In the past, we have faced difficulties obtaining such local content free of charge or negotiating contracts with local TV channel providers on satisfactory terms, which difficulties have in the past led to the removal of some of these channels. Additionally, from time to time, we face disputes over the rights to certain of the OTT content that we show. If we fail to produce, obtain or retain on satisfactory terms sufficient popular and quality programming for our digital cable and DTH services, or local content for our OTT content platform; if the content we provide is only popular for a short period of time; if our competitors secure content that is more popular than ours; or if the popularity of our content declines, our ability to attract customers from competitors to our services, retain current customers, compete effectively with free TV channel providers or recoup our content production costs may be limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, as we depend upon such content owners for the provision of content to attract and retain customers, content owners may have considerable power to renegotiate the license fees we pay them. Most license agreements are renewed on a regular basis, typically every three years. We may be unable to renew such contracts on terms that are similar to those of the current agreements, which could result in an increase in our content costs or, if we are unable to agree on the terms of service, the cancellation of such license contracts. The loss of certain content could, in turn, affect our customer base.

In addition, new technologies, such as 5G or 3D TV, will or may become dominant in the future, rendering our current technologies and systems obsolete. In particular, we expect certain communications technologies that are currently under development or have recently been introduced, namely 5G in the future and 4G LTE currently, which allow for faster data transmission and lower unit cost per gigabyte transferred traffic compared to 3G, to become increasingly important in our market. We currently hold a 4G license in Slovenia and in April 2021 acquired licenses for 5G spectrum frequencies in Slovenia. Vivacom holds a 4G license in Bulgaria and in May 2021, secured a license for 5G spectrum frequencies in Bulgaria after announcing the commercial launch of its 5G network in September 2020. Telemach Croatia holds a 4G license in Croatia and is participating in an auction for 5G spectrum frequencies in Croatia. However, if we are unable to effectively compete in the 4G market or keep pace with technological developments (particularly the development of our 5G network at a pace comparable to that of our competitors and acquire new frequencies) and invest significantly in 5G technologies, or if we are not successful in the Croatian auction for 5G spectrum frequencies, including the auction in respect of the Croatian mobile market, we could lose subscribers or fail to attract new subscribers, which would impact subscriber churn, or incur substantial costs and investments in order to maintain our subscriber base, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The availability of any new features developed for use in our industry can have a significant impact on a subscriber’s initial decision to choose our or a competitor’s products. We may not be able to develop or partner with third-party suppliers to gain access to technical advances before our competitors, match technological innovations by our competitors or design systems that meet subscribers’requirements. Our ability to effectively anticipate and adapt successfully to changes in technology in our industry and provide new or enhanced ----- services in a timely and cost-effective manner, or successfully anticipate the demands of our subscribers, will determine whether we will be able to increase or maintain our subscriber and revenue base. As a result, new or enhanced technologies, services or offerings we introduce may fail to achieve sufficient market acceptance or experience technical difficulties. For example, we do not expect that previously installed internet modems or set-top boxes will be able to support all of the enhancements we may introduce to our broadband internet and television services over time. If we fail to respond adequately to technological changes, we could lose subscribers and experience a decrease in revenues and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, the cost of implementing emerging and new technologies could be significant and we may fail to obtain the necessary financing. If we are unable to obtain such financing at attractive terms or at all, we might not be able to make the necessary technological changes or upgrades and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

See “Our Business—Regulatory _Framework.”_ Changes in laws, regulations or governmental policy affecting our activities and those of our competitors could significantly influence how we operate our business, our ability to offer certain products and services and our ability to introduce new products and services. In particular, regulatory changes relating to our activities and those of our competitors, such as changes relating to third-party access to cable networks, the costs of interconnection with other networks or the prices of competing products and services, or any change in policy allowing more favorable conditions for other operators, could adversely affect our ability to set prices, enter new markets or control our costs. In Serbia, we are the subject of various pending regulatory actions, including from the Serbian Tax Authority and RATEL. See “Our Business—Legal Proceedings.” In addition, any change in existing laws, regulations or governmental policies and/or the implementation of any new law, regulation, including sanction regimes, or governmental policy, both at a national or international level, on certain communication technologies that are currently under development or have recently been introduced, namely 5G, in the countries in which we operate, may result in increased costs and logistical complexity for us. For example, the U.S., the UK, Sweden, Poland and Romania have banned technology from Huawei, a Chinese telecommunications company, from being used in the development of their 5G networks, which in the UK is expected to delay the development of its 5G network and has compelled UK telecommunications companies to seek alternative suppliers. We have entered into a global frame agreement with Huawei in respect of mobile radio network equipment. For more information, see “Our Business— _Network—Mobile—Mobile Network Evolution—Mobile Radio Network Equipment Agreement.” If a similar_ ban is imposed in Slovenia, Bulgaria Croatia or Greece, or if otherwise obtaining or using Huawei technology is restricted by the governments of the countries in which we operate, this may result in us having to find alternative suppliers for 5G network equipment, which may increase costs for us to develop and maintain our networks and which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to introduce new products and services may also be affected if we cannot predict how existing or future laws, regulations or policies would apply to such products or services. In addition, our business and the industry in which we operate are subject to investigation by regulators, which could lead to enforcement actions, fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages. Any such action could harm our reputation and result in increased costs to the business.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

While Slovenia and Montenegro use the euro as the official currency, and while the value of the Bosnian mark and Bulgarian lev are pegged to the euro, we collect subscriber fees in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, North Macedonia and Bulgaria in local currencies. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the three months ended March 31, 2020 and the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated 28%, 48% and 42% of our revenues in Serbian dinar and Croatian kuna. At the same time, the vast majority of our costs to operate our business as well as our capital expenditure are paid in euros. The Serbian dinar has fluctuated in the past (including through inflation), and may fluctuate ----- in the future, resulting in significant and unpredictable foreign exchange losses and gains. Additionally, although the Croatian Kuna has been relatively stable in the past, given our increased exposure following the consummation of the Tele2 Croatia Acquisition, any fluctuations could affect our results of operations, as with the fluctuations of the Serbian Dinar in the past. If the euro appreciated in value against the Serbian dinar, the Bulgarian lev, the Croatian kuna (which will be replaced by the euro on January 1, 2023) or other local currencies, and we are unable to pass through increased costs to our customers or if we are unable to exchange the various local currencies into euros at all, our revenue would decrease which would make it more difficult to generate the cash necessary to continue our operations without disruptions, cover our costs and meet our capital expenditure requirements. Additionally, economic events in recent years affecting European economies have raised a number of questions regarding the stability and overall standing of the European Monetary Union. Credit risk in these countries and in other Eurozone countries, especially in Slovenia, could have a negative impact on our business. Concerns also remain regarding the overall stability and suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual states which use the euro. The departure or risk of departure from the euro by one or more Eurozone countries or the abandonment of the euro as a currency, or the reintroduction of an individual currency in Slovenia, as well as the de pegging of the Bosnian mark or the Bulgarian lev from the euro, could have major negative effects on our existing contractual relations with our customers, and could adversely affect the economy in Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Bulgaria, respectively. In particular, the departure of Slovenia from the euro would increase our exposure to changes in currency rates. Any of these developments could affect our ability to refinance our liabilities and have a significant negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933
382_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.17,"Any outbreak of severe communicable diseases, including COVID-19, may materially affect our business and results of operations.","Significant outbreaks of contagious diseases, including the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic or other illnesses, may result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, leading to substantial declines in consumer purchasing power and resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products and services, our ability to collect against existing trade receivables and our operating results. In particular, in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, during 2020 and the first half of 2021, governments of the countries in which we conduct our operations implemented several measures, including travel restrictions, lockdowns, quarantines and other social distancing measures, which have had a material adverse impact on the overall economies of such countries and, as a result, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, in particular, our revenues generated from advertising, media selling, mobile handsets sales and our mobile international roaming revenues as well as on our ARPUs. For example, from March 2020 until May 2020 and again in October 2020, the Netherlands adopted several social distancing and other restrictive measures, particularly with respect to access to restaurants, shopping centers and other commercial facilities, aimed at mitigating the negative consequences of the pandemic. In compliance with these restrictive measures, during the governmentimposed lockdowns we closed substantially all of our facilities in all of our countries of operation, while maintaining a limited number of employees in business critical functions on-site to operate our data centers and transitioned all of our remaining employees to remote working. As the governments of the countries in which we operate attempt to implement economic recovery measures while managing a resurgence in new infections, significant restrictions and social distancing measures remain in place or may be re imposed, which continue to adversely affect the economies of the countries in which we operate and, in turn, our operations. If a significant portion of our workforce is unable to work effectively due to prolonged illness, quarantines, shelter in place arrangements, government actions, facility closures or other reasons in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, our operations could be materially impacted. We may be unable to perform fully on our contracts and carry out new sales activity, and some of our costs may not be fully recoverable or adequately covered by insurance. In addition, as a result of social distancing measures and restrictions imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our customers may not be able to operate their businesses for a prolonged and indeterminate period of time, which, if realized, will likely impact our operations. Moreover, it is possible that the continued spread of COVID-19, further waves of infection, or a renewed or extended lockdown in one or more of the countries in which we operate, if realized, will cause further disruption in our business operations, cause delay, or limit the ability of, our customers to perform under their existing contracts, including making timely payments to us, and cause other unpredictable events. Customers may experience significant losses due to the COVID-19 outbreak and may terminate their existing contracts or postpone or ultimately cancel future planned orders and contracts due to those losses. Both domestic and international travel may be further ----- restricted to certain areas which may limit our ability to obtain new customers and enter new markets, to provide services in the areas in which our customers are currently located or otherwise conduct our operations as we have done in the past. To the extent our activities are disrupted by restrictions imposed by governments or other authorities to address the risk of transmission of COVID-19, or by changes in customer behavior, this may result in a loss of customers, and our future rate of growth may slow compared to our past growth rates. The general economic impact of COVID-19 restrictions on the communities that we serve may result in customers not being able to continue to pay for our services or deciding to postpone, cancel or reduce their existing subscriptions. This could result in an increase in bad debts and cancellations, as well as a reduction or delay in revenue collection, which could negatively impact our liquidity, cash flow, profitability and attrition rate. In addition, social distancing measures resulting in the cancellation or postponement of certain sporting events have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the results of our Media Group segment. In particular, as a result of such measures revenues generated from our Media Group segment, excluding the impact of revenues generated by NOVA BG, decreased by 11% in the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to the same period in 2020, due to the strategic decision to provide exclusive sport and other content to United Group companies which led to the non-prolongation of carriage deals with certain pay-TV providers in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The disruptions triggered by COVID-19 in countries where our suppliers and customers are located, may result in a slowdown of their production activities and other disruptions, any of which could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, in some of the jurisdictions in which we operate we have received certain state supported aid which we may be obliged to return if certain conditions are met, potentially together with interest in arrears from the day of the receipt of the relevant aid. In addition, political repercussions of responses to the COVID-19 outbreak by European Union institutions as well as by other countries in the European Union could have complex and hard to predict consequences for the future, including a destabilization of the European Union or its institutions or a slow down or reversal of European integration. It is unclear whether measures taken by European Union institutions, the governments of the countries in which we operate to contain the COVID-19 outbreak are adequate and will be effective in achieving their goals. It is unclear when, if at all, the COVID-19 outbreak will be contained. We cannot guarantee that COVID-19 or any future outbreak of another virus or other contagious disease will not have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affects our business, results of operations and financial condition depends on several factors, such as the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, any additional periods of lockdown in the countries in which our customers are located, and the pace at which demand, pricing and, in general, economic and operating conditions will stabilize and recover in the countries where we operate. Any future developments are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operation, financial condition and prospects, as well as our ability to perform our obligations under the New Notes, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

While the EU and the UK agreed a comprehensive, zero- tariff, zero-quota free trade agreement on December 24, 2020, which was ratified by the UK parliament on December 30, 2020 and came into force on January 1, 2021, the end of the transition period has led to increased customs, health and safety checks at the border, which could delay or disrupt the movement of goods between the EU and the UK, undermine bilateral cooperation in key policy areas, significantly disrupt trade between the UK and the EU and cause political and economic instability in other countries of the EU. Additionally, the UK has ceased to be a member of the EU single market, which has ended the free movement of services and workers between the UK and the EU and may make it more difficult for our UK operations to do business with customers or suppliers that are based in the EU. The impact of the UK-EU trade agreement and the resulting effects on the political and economic future of the UK remain uncertain. Economic instability and uncertainty in Europe, has and may continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. ----- Due to the size and importance of the UK economy, the uncertainty and unpredictability concerning the UK’s legal, political and economic relationship with Europe may continue to be a source of instability in the international markets, create significant currency fluctuations, and/or otherwise adversely affect trading agreements or similar cross border cooperation arrangements (whether economic, tax, fiscal, legal, regulatory or otherwise) for the foreseeable future. It is also possible that the exit of the UK from the EU will lead other EU Member States to consider leaving the EU, which could be an additional source of instability in the international markets. Further, other EU Member States within the Eurozone could decide to discontinue their use of the euro as their functional currency. The exit of the UK (or the possible exit of any other country) from the EU, the potential withdrawal of Scotland from the UK, or prolonged periods of uncertainty relating to any of these possibilities, could result in significant macroeconomic deterioration, including, but not limited to, further decreases in global stock exchange indices, increased foreign exchange volatility (in particular a further weakening of the pound sterling and euro against other leading currencies), and decreased GDP in the EU or other markets in which we operate. In addition, there are increasing concerns that these events could push the UK or Eurozone into an economic recession and/or worsen the economic recession caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic, any of which, were they to occur, would further destabilize the global financial markets. Our operations are also subject to risks from high levels of sovereign debt in certain European countries, which combined with weak economic growth and high unemployment, could lead to fiscal reforms (including austerity measures), sovereign debt restructurings, higher levels of volatility and potential disruptions in the credit and equity markets, in particular as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. With regard to currency instability issues, concerns exist in the Eurozone with respect to individual macro fundamentals on a country by country basis, as well as with respect to the overall stability of the European Monetary Union and the suitability of a single currency to appropriately deal with specific fiscal management and sovereign debt issues in individual Eurozone countries. The realization of these concerns could lead to the exit of one or more countries from the European Monetary Union and the re-introduction of individual currencies in these countries or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the European Monetary Union entirely. The capital market disruption that would likely accompany any such event could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial condition. Furthermore, any redenomination event would likely be accompanied by significant economic dislocation, particularly within the Eurozone countries, which in turn could have an adverse impact on demand for our products, and accordingly, on our revenue and cash flows. As we generate revenue in a number of different currencies, including the euro, Serbian dinar, Bosnian mark, Bulgarian lev and Croatian kuna, increased currency fluctuation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. See “—We are exposed to currency exchange fluctuation and currency instability _risks in Europe that could have an adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition and cash flows.”_ For these reasons, legal, political and economic uncertainty in the Eurozone could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

As some of our operations, such as network expansions and construction or acquisition of cable assets, depend on governmental approval and regulatory decisions, we may make decisions influenced by political considerations rather than fully exploiting our contractual or legal rights, in order to avoid negatively affecting our relationship with national, regional or local authorities, including regulators. Additionally, the respective governments in our core markets currently own a majority stake in our biggest competitors in those markets: Telekom Slovenije in Slovenia, Telekom Srbija in Serbia and BH Telecom and HT Eronet in Bosnia and Herzegovina. As a result of this, our competitors may have special privileges with regulatory authorities or receive other forms of governmental support. Accordingly, our operations may be constrained by the relevant political environment and may be adversely affected by such constraints. Each of the countries in which we operate has a short legislative, judicial and administrative history and it is not possible to predict with certainty the effect of current and future legislation on our business. Company, commercial, contract, customs, currency, property, banking, bankruptcy, competition, securities, labor, tax and other laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate (including those concerning privatization and the compensation of former owners) are still developing and continue to be substantially revised. There is little precedent for how these laws and regulations will be interpreted or implemented either by the courts or government agencies. Existing and future laws and regulations may be applied inconsistently. For example, in ----- Bulgaria, the regulatory practices of the Bulgarian Commission for Protection of Competition and the Bulgarian Communications Regulation Commission is not always concerted which can cause conflicting decisions in the regulation of electronic communications. These factors could result in market uncertainty, lack of clear criteria and in many cases could lead to excessive regulation. In the jurisdictions in which we operate, we may experience difficulties or delays in obtaining permits or other governmental authorizations. Additionally, in certain countries in which we operate, political, security and economic changes may result in political and regulatory uncertainty and civil unrest. In Bulgaria, for example, protests against alleged government corruption began in July 2020, resulting in large demonstrations in Sofia, Varna, Plovdiv and other areas of the country. Protestors demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Boyko Borissov and the state chief prosecutor. Although the protests ceased at the beginning of November 2020, an election held in April 2021 resulted in no party being able or willing to form a government, and snap parliamentary elections were held on July 11, 2021. The results of the new elections were similar to those held in April 2021 and therefore there is uncertainty on whether a government will be formed. The uncertainty around the stability of the Bulgarian government could have a material adverse effect on our development in the country, including our plans for building our mobile network and growing our customer base. Furthermore, the majority of countries in which we operate are emerging economies and as such are more susceptible to adverse global economic trends and higher inflationary pressure, which could have a negative effect on the growth of our business or operations, increase our operating costs or decrease consumer demand and spending power. Additionally, the judicial systems of certain of the countries in which we operate may not be fully independent of social, economic and political forces, and many courts in these countries experience a high volume of case backlogs. This often results in inconsistent judicial interpretation of laws and regulations and excessive delays in court proceedings. Relatedly, certain market participants in the countries in which we operate may conduct their operations without regard for applicable laws or regulations, which creates competitive disadvantages for other participants. In Bulgaria, for example, it is not uncommon for certain TV operators to use content illegally without contracts with the content owners or to underreport the number of their subscribers or for certain broadband operators to provide internet access with cable networks constructed in non-compliance with Bulgarian regulations. As a result of the foregoing, we may operate with competitive disadvantages or may not be able to enforce our legal rights efficiently or successfully, including title to our intellectual property, under the laws of the countries in which we operate. Each of these factors could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial conditions or result of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Effective internal and disclosure controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to operate successfully as a business. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls. In recent years, we have significantly expanded the size and scope of our operations, including through acquisitions in new geographical jurisdictions and in new areas of business, and we intend to continue such growth. As we expand the size and scope of our Group, there is an increased risk that our internal controls may not mature at the same pace. For example, some of the processes related to internal controls may be new for personnel in certain newly acquired subsidiaries or newly entered jurisdictions in our structure, and in the case of acquisitions, may take time to be fully implemented. Furthermore, maintenance of internal controls may become more difficult as certain of the entities we have acquired or may acquire may prepare their financial statements in accordance with local accounting rules rather than IFRS. As we grow, the required sophistication of our internal controls and accounting and financial reporting functions will also need to expand to ensure our internal controls remain adequate. Moreover, recently adopted and complex accounting standards and interpretations, such as IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and IFRS 16, the amendments to IFRS 2 and IFRIC 23, have created new and more demanding requirements for financial reporting and disclosures, which require further development of our internal controls. In prior years, our auditors auditing our financial statements under International Standards on Auditing identified certain significant deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting. A significant deficiency in internal control, as defined under International Standards on Auditing, is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control that, in an independent auditors’ professional judgment, is of sufficient importance to merit the attention of those charged with governance. This definition differs from the definition that would be applied if an audit was conducted with standards applicable in the United States. The significant deficiencies identified related to deficiencies in the size of our accounting and financial reporting functions, deficiencies in the number of qualified personnel with IFRS accounting experience employed in those functions, deficiencies in controls to ensure that all significant transactions affecting the Group, whether initiated within or outside of its perimeter, are comprehensively analyzed and, where necessary, appropriately recognized and disclosed in the financial statements, deficiencies in controls over user access to our critical information technology, deficiencies in processes and controls relating to capitalization, commencement of depreciation and assessing the useful lives and in respect of property, plant and equipment, deficiencies in accounting for certain potential tax exposures and deficiencies in the process of application of the new accounting standards. We continuously evaluate our policies and procedures to develop our internal controls, and we monitor our internal controls to identify any deficiencies, including as identified above. If our internal controls do not keep pace with growth in the size and sophistication of our businesses and the applicable financial reporting framework, we may not be able to implement and maintain adequate internal controls. If we fail to implement and maintain effective internal controls, it could result in material misstatements in our financial statements or failure to meet our reporting obligations in a timely manner, which may cause a loss of confidence in our reported financial information and could have a negative impact on the trading price and liquidity of the New Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

We may not be able to sustain the level of subscriber growth, and further increases in subscription fees may meet customer resistance and lead to increases in churn rates. If we are unable to execute our business strategy, the Pay-TV, broadband internet and fixed-line and mobile-telephony markets in the regions in which we operate do not continue to grow as we expect, or we encounter other unforeseen difficulties in acquiring ----- new subscribers or selling additional products and services to existing subscribers, we may experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, a number of free television channels are available across the markets in which we operate. Historically, the migration of subscribers from unmanaged free terrestrial television has been slow. While we believe that our product offering is of a higher quality than the television channels available free of charge, there can be no assurance that the speed with which customers migrate from free television services to Pay-TV services will increase, and consequently, we cannot guarantee that Pay-TV penetration rates across Southeastern Europe will converge on the higher penetration rates characteristic of other major Western European markets which may, in turn, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933
382_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.29,Customer churn may adversely affect our financial performance.,"Customer churn refers to those subscribers who cease subscribing to one or more of our products and services. In the ordinary course of our business, we experience a loss of customers due to their choice to obtain services from a competitor (including from competing types of services, such as OTT TV services in lieu of cable Pay-TV, or mobile-telephony in lieu of fixed-line service), relocation of our customers to areas not covered by our network and cancellation of services for customers who, after several reminders, do not pay our invoices. For example, our annual cable Pay-TV subscriber churn rates for the three months ended March 31, 2021 were 8% for the Telemach Slovenia segment, 10% for the SBB Serbia segment, 9% for the Telemach BH segment and 11% for the Vivacom segment (based on IPTV subscribers). Factors impacting churn in our consumer subscriber base include existing customers moving outside of our current geographical area of service as well as termination of services contracts by us due to existing customers’ inability to pay, as well as competition. For example, any interruption of our services, the removal or unavailability of programming or any other customer service problems, whether or not attributable to us, could contribute to increased subscriber churn or cause us to fail in our goal of reducing the level of churn of our Pay-TV, broadband internet and fixed-line and mobile-telephony services. Additionally, price increases (by us or across the industry) could lead to increased subscriber churn. Subscriber churn reduces our subscription base and causes us to incur additional costs to replace the cancelled subscribers, such as advertising and marketing costs. A significant increase in our churn rates may require us to incur additional costs to replace subscribers lost to cancellation. Additionally, even with increased marketing efforts, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to replace the subscribers who left us at all. Therefore, if a significant number of our subscribers cancel or do not renew their contracts with us, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected. Additionally, we incur upfront cash expenses for the installation of our cable TV and internet equipment and handset subsidies with new customers which we recoup over the duration of the services contract. As a result, should an increased number of subscribers cancel our services before we can recoup these initial cash expenses, this would have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Should we be unable to compete on the quality of our content and services in the future, for example, as a result of loss of content to our competitors, we may need to increase our marketing and advertising efforts, which would lead to an increase in marketing expenses.

If any part of our HFC network, mobile network or IT infrastructure or any of our customer service centers is compromised or damaged by flood, fire or other natural disaster, terrorism, illegal piracy, power loss, system failure, denial of service attack, cyber-attack or other catastrophe, our operations could be materially adversely affected. Disaster recovery, security and service continuity protection measures that we currently have or may in the future undertake, and our monitoring of network performance, may be insufficient to prevent losses. ----- In addition, our business is dependent on sophisticated critical systems, such as our customer service systems and billing systems. Despite the presence of back-up systems, we can provide no assurances that our network and technical systems will not be damaged by physical or electronic breakdowns, cyber-attacks, computer viruses or similar disruptions. In addition, unforeseen problems may create disruptions in our information technology systems. There can be no assurance that our existing security system, security policy, back-up systems, physical access security and access protection, user administration and emergency plans will be sufficient to prevent data loss or minimize network downtime. Sustained or repeated disruptions or damage to our network and technical systems that prevent, interrupt, delay or make it more difficult for us to provide products and services to our customers in accordance with the agreements we have with our customers may trigger claims for payment of damages or contractual remedies and would cause considerable damage to our reputation, lead to the loss of customers and require repairs or replacement of part of our network, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, we rely on hardware, software, technical services and customer support provided by third parties. We do not control the proper functioning of such third-party equipment, and to the extent hardware, software, technical services and customer support provided by third parties fails, our business operations may be adversely affected. For example, in 2015 our mobile operations in Slovenia were disrupted for a four hour period due to technical problems with our mobile network. Further, any security breaches, such as misappropriation, misuse, penetration by viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information technology systems (or those of our business partners) and networks, including customer, personnel and vendor data, could damage our reputation, result in legal and/or regulatory action against us, and require us to expend significant capital and other resources to remedy any such security breach.

In addition, an increase in our customers’ internet usage or demand for higher bandwidth may require us to further invest in the capacity of our network. As a result, we expect that technological innovation as well as ongoing customer growth will lead to additional capital expenditure. In addition, any new or enhanced products or services we introduce, including internet and telephony products, may require an upgrade of local and in-house networks, in which case we may be required to cover a portion, or all, of the costs of such upgrade. Our current assumptions regarding the costs associated with the maintenance and further development of our cable and mobile networks, including the implementation of new standards, may prove to be inaccurate. No assurance can be given that our future investments and network upgrades will generate a positive return or that we will have adequate capital available to finance such future upgrades. In addition, rapidly changing technology requires careful review of life cycles for our assets and may result in additional depreciation or impairment costs. If we are unable to, or elect not to, pay for costs associated with adding new customers, expanding or upgrading our network or making our other planned or unplanned capital expenditure, or if we experience unexpected material depreciation or impairment costs, or do not manage our project portfolio effectively to ensure the proper allocation of resources between projects, our growth could be limited and our competitive position could be harmed.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

In many cases, our services depend on the technical specifications of equipment or software of a particular provider such as the method of content encryption, making it difficult for us to quickly change supply, maintenance or other essential relationships in the event that our provider refuses to offer us favorable prices, fails to provide the support that we require, or ceases to produce equipment or provide satisfactory customer service. Additionally, if our suppliers were to discontinue certain products or services, were unable to provide equipment to meet our specifications or interrupt the provision of equipment or services to us, or seek to charge us prices that are not competitive or withdraw discounts that have been previously agreed, we may have ----- to find alternative suppliers. Switching to alternative suppliers could cause us to experience difficulties or delays, or to incur significant costs, or if we were unable to replace such services or products in a timely and cost-efficient manner, our business and profitability could be materially adversely affected. We are party to a number of roaming agreements, under which we are provided with network services allowing us to offer mobile-telephony services to our subscribers in areas where we do not have our own network coverage. The loss of any of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, an increase in the number and volume of calls by our subscribers served on the networks of other MNOs could require future negotiations for lower national roaming/network sharing prices in order to maintain or decrease the cost of national roaming/network sharing, which may not be achievable. If any of the events described above were to occur, our national roaming/network sharing or interconnection costs could increase. In the event that this disrupts our network access or coverage in a manner which we cannot resolve through our other agreements, we may have to increase our capital expenditure in order to extend our radio network or enter into agreements with other network access providers on terms that may not be as favorable as the terms of the terminated agreement. If any of these events were to occur, or if we face an increase in costs incurred under one of our national roaming/network sharing agreements, it would have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations, or, if we are not able to fund capital expenditure to extend our radio network, such failure would affect the level of services which we can offer which could cause us to lose subscribers or fail to attract new subscribers, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Subscribers generally judge our performance through their interactions with the staff at our monitoring centers, the reliability of our products and our maintenance performance for any products that require repair. If we fail to meet our subscribers’ expectations, we may lose subscribers or have greater difficulty attracting new subscribers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have also experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, a slightly negative perception of our brand by certain groups of the population in Bosnia and Herzegovina as a result of the recent political history of the region and our perceived Serbian identity.

For example, we lease cable duct space used for parts of our cable network and purchase telephony interconnection services and mobile network services from Telekom Slovenije in Slovenia, and rely on lease agreements with Telekom Srbija and HT Eronet for cable duct space and the use of their fixed telephone lines in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Furthermore, Telekom Slovenije provides us with fiber optic connection lines for certain areas. In addition, we have interconnection agreements with our Bulgarian competitors, including collocation agreements, and rely on lease agreements with them for fiber optic connection lines for certain areas in Bulgaria. In Croatia, we have national roaming agreements, site sharing agreements and leased line agreements with Croatian Telekom, as well as site sharing agreements, leased line agreements and dark fiber agreements with A1. In Greece, Forthnet has agreements with both OTE and an MVNO contract with Vodafone. Our ability to offer our services to our customers depends on the performance of the respective partner of their obligations under the applicable lease and services agreements. Pursuant to the terms of such lease and services agreements, the respective other party has the right to terminate the services under the agreements in certain circumstances and under certain conditions or has the right to unilaterally increase prices. For example, in 2011, Telekom Srbija significantly raised prices for the use of their duct space. The termination of any material portion or all of such lease or service agreements would require us to find alternative solutions and it may be difficult to establish an alternative at a reasonable price, which would adversely affect the value of our business. Additionally, our business relationships with our state-owned competitors might be affected by a close alignment between the state’s interests and our competitor’s business operations as a result of which our competitors might, for example, enjoy special privileges with regulatory authorities. Additionally, should we be unable to successfully negotiate moderate price increases, or should we be unable to pass through price increases to our customers, our profitability, financial condition and results of operation may be adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

However, the amount of available spectrum suitable for our operations is limited and the process for obtaining it is complex. We therefore cannot guarantee that we, or our customers, will have sufficient access to spectrum to maintain and develop our services in the future. We believe that spectrum licenses will be particularly important for competing for 4G and 5G networks during the next five to ten years, and to that end we have successfully acquired 5G spectrum in Bulgaria and Slovenia and are participating in a spectrum auction in Croatia. There can be no guarantee that we will be successful in our efforts to outbid competitors for blocks of frequency in these bands in upcoming auctions. In addition, should the governments of the countries in which we operate decide to reallocate spectrum to 5G, then we may be required to obtain additional spectrum to maintain our existing product offering. We believe that spectrum success in coming spectrum auctions will be pivotal to meet the growing capacity demand in the mobile market and to accommodate new 5G services. In addition, a new mobile network operator could successfully enter the mobile telecommunications market in the countries in which we operate. Although the long-term nature of the licenses granted in spectrum auctions could constitute significant barriers to entry for potential new competitors, a new MNO could develop and operate a network infrastructure in a specific geographical region in which we operate.

In particular, in 2007, the European Regulation (EC) No 717/2007 of the European Parliament and the European Council of June 27, 2007 on roaming on public mobile telephone networks within the European Community (the “Community”) amending Directive 2002/21/EC came into effect, as well as, in 2009, Regulation (EC) No 544/2009 of the European Parliament and of the European Council of June 18, 2009 was introduced amending Regulation (EC) No 717/2007 on roaming on public mobile telephone networks within the Community. Both provided for a steady reduction in mobile retail and wholesale prices for voice calls, SMS and data. On June 13, 2012, however, Regulation (EC) No 544/2009 was repealed by Regulation (EU) No. 531/2012 of the European Parliament and of the European Council of June 13, 2012 on roaming on public mobile communications networks within the EU. Pursuant to the latter regulation, the maximum retail prices and average wholesale prices for roaming mobile services (calls, mobile data and SMS) decreased on July 1, 2013 and decreased further on July 1, 2014, and were fully eliminated on June 15, 2017. Additionally, a “decoupling regime”has been introduced to increase competition in the international roaming market, and the result has been a reduction in international roaming retail prices to below the regulatory caps. This “decoupling regime” came into effect on July 1, 2014 and introduced market participants in the form of alternative roaming providers. Additionally, the “decoupling regime” foresees local break out services (the ability for foreign MNOs to target our outbound roaming customers to directly offer them data only services on their networks). Such services would be paid directly by such roaming customer to the visited roaming network. ----- Furthermore, certain countries in the region, including Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro, are party to a regional initiative for a phased reduction of roaming prices between such countries. In the region, from July 1, 2019, mobile calls cost €0.19 per minute, SMS service costs €0.06 per message and mobile data costs €0.18 per megabyte (all prices exclusive of VAT). Pursuant to this initiative, as of July 1, 2021, roaming costs were abolished between Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Kosovo, North Macedonia and Serbia. This shift could create increased price pressure on roaming charges that forces us to lower our prices further to match the market standard or risk losing customers to other providers.

While Slovenia joined the European Union in 2004 and has generally made the transition to a functioning market economy, the political and economic reforms implemented by the respective governments of Croatia, despite having joined the European Union in 2013, and of Serbia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina are at a less developed stage than Slovenia. Since the end of the Yugoslav wars in 1995, the countries formerly comprising Yugoslavia have made significant progress towards becoming more democratic and liberalized market economies; however, building Serbia’s, Bosnia and Herzegovina’s, Montenegro’s, Croatia’s and North Macedonia’s political and economic systems and infrastructure to a CEE or Western European standard will require further investment and may take some years to complete. We cannot assure you that Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Croatia and North Macedonia will achieve their intended aims with the implemented reforms, that a political environment supportive of these reforms will be maintained or that the governments in the respective countries will not implement regulations or fiscal or monetary policies, or otherwise take actions which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, the key risk to stability in Serbia remains the status of Kosovo’s independence, and the country’s history of political instability makes it difficult to predict the occurrence of events or circumstances, such as war or hostilities, and no assurance can be given that we would be able to sustain our current profit levels in Serbia if adverse political events or circumstances were to occur. Following the completion of the Vivacom Acquisition, we also have operations in Bulgaria. Although Bulgaria, a former communist country which joined NATO in 2004 and the EU in 2007, has an open economy that historically has demonstrated strong growth, economic headwinds remain in the near and long-term. Corruption in public administration, a weak judiciary, weak productivity, a lack of transparency in public procurements, an uncertain political environment and the presence of organized crime present significant challenges to sustainable economic growth in Bulgaria. The foregoing political and economic challenges in the countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933
382_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.42,We may become subject to more extensive regulation due to our scale.,"The European Union competition framework imposes pricing and other potential requirements on entities deemed to have significant market power (“SMP”) in non-competitive relevant markets in which they operate. Among other markets, the European Commission has identified “wholesale broadband access” and “the termination on an individual fixed network” as relevant markets. The European Union competition framework has been implemented in Slovenia and Bulgaria; Croatia has largely aligned its law with the EU requirements; and Serbia, albeit not yet an EU Member State, continues its efforts to harmonize its law with the European framework and has recently promulgated new rules applicable to the electronic communications sector. Telemach Slovenia is deemed to have SMP in: (i) voice call termination in an individual public mobile telephone network (inter operator market) and (ii) call termination in an individual telephone network at a fixed location (inter operator market). Vivacom has been deemed to have SMP in the following regulated markets: (i) termination on fixed network, (ii) call termination for mobile voice service and (iii), until ----- June 2019, local access provided at a fixed location wholesale access provided at a fixed location. Telemach Croatia has been deemed to have SMP in the market for voice call termination in an individual public mobile telephone network. SBB Serbia is currently deemed to have SMP on the wholesale market for call termination in public telephone networks on fixed location and the wholesale market of central access service provided on a fixed location for mass market products. Telemach BH and MNE were also determined to have SMP on the wholesale market for call termination in the individual public network at a fixed location. Being designated as having SMP may carry with it: an obligation to publish data from accounting records, technical specifications, network characteristics, terms and conditions for supply and use or validity periods of offers and prices; an obligation to only engage in nondiscriminatory conduct; an obligation to keep separate accounts for interconnection and access services; an obligation to provide access and use of parts of our network infrastructure and associated facilities to third parties; price controls and cost based accounting; an obligation to make available a minimum set of leased lines; an obligation to offer operator selection and operator pre-selection services; and regulation of retail services, including an obligation to unbundle products and services. There is a risk that we could be found to have SMP in other geographical markets in which we operate if local regulators identify these areas as relevant markets in which there is not sufficient competition. The designation of our business as an SMP provider could result in requiring us to provide other service providers access to our network for purposes of providing competing broadband and broadcasting services at regulated prices, and impose other restrictions on how we operate our network and market our services, including the imposition of a requirement to obtain additional permits and licenses for our operations. Granting such access would limit the bandwidth available to us to provide other products and services to our customers. Such regulation could, among other things, impair our ability to use our bandwidth in ways that would generate maximum revenue, create a shortage of capacity on our network, which could limit the types and variety of services we could provide to our customers, strengthen our competitors by granting them access in our network and lowering their costs to offer competing products and services and have a significant adverse impact on our profitability. Forthnet in Greece acts as universal service provider, which also impose certain regulatory filings on it. Furthermore, we may be subject to fines for infringement of relevant local competition laws. For example, we have been subject to competition proceedings in Bosnia related to our provision of sports content, and in 2015 and 2017, United Media Distribution, a former subsidiary of the Group, was fined approximately €250,000 for an allegation of continuing abuse of dominance. We have taken steps to address the concerns of the Bosnian competition authorities, including offering our sports content to third parties on terms that are comparable to those on which we offer this content to our Group companies.

In addition, we are subject to proceedings in Slovenia related to competition rules connected to alleged abuse of dominant market position and with respect to certain of our acquisitions. See “—We have made and may _make acquisitions or enter into transactions that may present unforeseen risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction and, additionally, there are risks associated with the integration of any acquisitions.”_ We cannot guarantee that we will not be subject to further regulatory scrutiny in respect of: (i) our market position in Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece or any other jurisdiction in which we operate, (ii) matters involving merger control filings or (iii) exclusive and restrictive content contracts, and may be liable to pay fines or other sanctions in the future, especially as local law and local customs continue to be updated based on CEE or Western European legal standards.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

While the substantial majority of our employees currently are not members of labor unions, we cannot guarantee that a larger portion of our employees will not associate with such unions in the future, especially as the labor standards in our countries of operations converge with CEE or Western European standards. As a result, we might also become subject to collective bargaining agreements which could regulate, inter alia, the general labor conditions of our employees, working hours, holidays, termination, provisions and general payment schemes for wages. Moreover, strikes and other industrial actions, as well as the negotiation of collective bargaining ----- agreements or salary increases in the future, could disrupt our operations and make it more costly to operate our facilities, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, our business operations might be negatively affected by changes in local labor law and labor market practice, such as the imposition of, or increases in, minimum wages, or a more restrictive interpretation of the status of alternative hiring arrangements as employment. While we believe we are currently in line with local, regional and national labor market practices, there can be no assurance that labor laws, market practice, or enforcement focus, will not change. Should we fail to comply with relevant labor laws and regulations, we might be exposed to fines which could have a negative impact on our profitability, financial condition and result of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

The data protection authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate have the right to audit us and impose fines if they find we have not complied with the applicable laws and adequately protected customer data. Although we take industry standard precautions to protect customer data in accordance with the applicable privacy requirements, we cannot exclude the possibility that sensitive data may leak in the future due to human error, technological failure, database piracy, security breaches or other circumstances. We cooperate with third-party service providers, for the provision of call center services, for example, and independent sales agents, and we cannot exclude the possibility that such third parties could also experience system failures involving the storage or transmission of proprietary information. In addition, although the terms of our contracts restrict the usage of customer data and we perform pre-contractual due diligence, we cannot guarantee that third parties will abide by the contractual terms. Violation of data protection laws by such third parties or ourselves may result in fines, reputational damage and customer churn, as well as the misappropriation of confidential information, interruptions in our operations and damage to hardware infrastructure, and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we have implemented significant technical and operational measures, we may be exposed to database piracy or other database security breaches which could result in the leakage and unauthorized dissemination of information about our subscribers, including their names, addresses, home phone numbers, individual tax numbers and other personal data. Even though we have data breach response plans in place, the breach of security of our database and illegal sale or other unauthorized release of our subscribers’personal information could materially adversely impact our reputation, prompt lawsuits against us by individual and corporate subscribers, lead to violations of data protection laws and adverse actions by the telecommunications regulators and other authorities, lead to a loss in subscribers and hinder our ability to attract new subscribers. For example, in June 2020 we detected that Telemach Croatia had been affected by a cyber-intrusion and breach of its customers’ personal data site in early 2020, in which certain personal data became available to third parties. Although there is no evidence that any personal data was actually extracted from the relevant servers, we have reported the event to the applicable regulators and taken remedial steps to prevent future breaches. We do not currently expect any financial consequences stemming from the breach, but we cannot rule out such outcomes in the future. If severe customer data security breaches are detected, regulatory authorities may sanction us, and such sanctions can include suspension of operations for some time period. In addition, we may be exposed to cyber-attacks, which could result in equipment failures or disruptions in our operations. Our inability to operate our network as a result of such events may result in significant expense or loss of market shares. These factors, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We are subject to European data protection laws and regulations. These laws and regulations regulate numerous important aspects of our business and place material constraints on our interactions with consumers. The General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation EU/2016/679, “GDPR”), entered into force on May 25, 2018 and covers legal areas relating to the protection as well as the free movement of personal data and provides for potential penalties of up to €20 million or 4% of total worldwide annual turnover for cases of non-compliance. As data protection authorities continue to release guidance on the implementation of GDPR obligations, the legal framework will evolve and best practice examples will continue to emerge and may require us to adapt our policies in compliance. GDPR requires us to ensure that data minimization is embedded across the Group so that only the appropriate amount of data required for any particular purpose is processed, that we delete any unnecessary datasets and that we anonymize data wherever possible. The ----- implementation of these obligations creates increased compliance risk that may lead to regulatory intervention. For example, in 2018, Telemach Slovenia was subject to proceedings initiated by AKOS concerning the storage of traffic data relating to prepaid users and the implementation of measures for the timely deletion of, and prevention of unauthorized access to, subscriber data which could have resulted in a fine ranging between €50,000 and €400,000. In these proceedings, Telemach Slovenia was found to be compliant. In addition, any irregularities could expose us to claims for damages by subscribers. Furthermore, we provide mobile, broadband and landline voice services to a number of public and private financial institutions, government entities and corporate customers with data security requirements. These customers may continue to increase their data security requirements, and we may be required to undertake additional investments in order to adhere to these enhanced data security requirements, as well as evolving statutory and regulatory requirements, including obtaining and maintaining certain ISO certifications, improving access rights management systems and developing a corporate data encryption infrastructure. As a result, we may undertake additional capital expenditure to satisfy data security requirements. If we are unable to satisfy such data security requirements, customers could decide to terminate their contracts with us, and such terminations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Should any of these matters be decided against us, it could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business and on our financial condition. On an ongoing basis, we attempt to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these proceedings or claims, and to take all necessary steps to adequately defend our interests, although it is difficult to predict final outcomes with any degree of certainty and we can offer no assurances in this regard. We are currently involved in a number of legal proceedings that have arisen in the ordinary course of our business, including disputes related to intellectual property rights. Please see “Our Business—Legal _Proceedings.”_ From time to time, we may also become involved in litigation matters pending against entities that we acquire. For example, KATV HS d.o.o. and HKB net d.o.o., two small cable operators in Bosnia and Herzegovina that we acquired in July 2015, are subject to disputes with their minority shareholders relating to a prior sale of these companies. The outcome of these disputes is difficult to anticipate and could have an adverse effect on our financial position and profitability if the final, non-appealable judgments in these matters are not consistent with our current expectations. Further, Telemach Slovenia, as successor to Tušmobil, which we acquired in April 2015, has had certain criminal proceedings pending against it, its then-owner Mirko Tuš and former head of AKOS (Tomaž Simonič) since 2015. A final court decision in February 2019 recognized that the statute of limitations had expired for Telemach Slovenia. Although following this decision Telemach Slovenia can no longer be found to be criminally liable, Telemach Slovenia may still be required to make an indemnification payment as a recipient of an alleged illegal benefit, if any of the other alleged offenders (against whom the criminal proceedings are still continuing) are found to be criminally liable. In February 2020, the first instance court acquitted Tomaž Simonič of the charges in the amended bill of indictment regarding misuse of public positions or rights. In December 2020, upon the public prosecutor’s appeal, the Higher Court of Ljubljana annulled this judgment and returned the case to the first instance court for retrial. The outcome of these proceedings, although difficult to predict, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and profitability if the final, non-appealable judgment in this matter is not consistent with our current expectations, and we are not able to successfully recover such amounts from Tušmobil’s seller. In addition, Telemach Slovenia had certain administrative proceedings against it in which the grant of a block of spectrum which we use for part of our 3G mobile services was initially successfully challenged in front of the Slovenian administrative court. The fact that the administrative court has now ruled in our favor against AKOS in this matter, reduces, but does not eliminate, the likelihood that we would need to re-tender for this block or pay a fee or rent for use of the spectrum, as this matter was sent back to AKOS for a new determination process. See “Our Business—Legal _Proceedings.”_ ----- In addition, we and/or Vivacom are, or might become, subject to legal proceedings and investigations in various jurisdictions, including, without limitation, the pending former Vivacom shareholder litigation in Luxembourg or as a result of the entry into the Vivacom Acquisition Agreement. See “Our Business—Legal _Proceedings.” We are, and will be, unable to predict an outcome, favorable or unfavorable, or to estimate the_ amount of any potential loss in connection with any such legal proceedings. There is also a risk that the former direct and indirect shareholders of the Vivacom Seller attempt to initiate other proceedings in Bulgaria or other jurisdictions in support of the pending Luxembourg shareholder litigation, or to attempt to reverse the consummation of, or claim damages due to, the Vivacom Acquisition. If we are successfully joined as a defendant to legal proceedings and claims are made against us and/or adverse developments in any on-going litigations occur, we may incur additional costs or may be required to pay damages or similar fees. Such costs, damages or fees may be in excess of amounts for which we are able to collect under contractual arrangements, including the Vivacom Acquisition Agreement. We cannot assure you that the costs, charges, liabilities or other regulatory outcomes associated with any of the foregoing matters will not be material, or that those costs, charges, liabilities or regulatory outcomes will not exceed any amounts reserved for them in our financial statements. In future periods, we could be subject to cash costs or non-cash charges to earnings if any of these matters are resolved unfavorably to us. Additionally, any reputational damage associated with such legal or regulatory proceedings could have a material impact on our business.

Third parties may be able to copy, infringe or otherwise profit from our proprietary and licensed content, without our, or the respective right holders’, authorization. The risk of piracy is especially acute in our Pay-TV business segment. Media piracy occurs in many parts of the world, including Southeastern Europe, and is facilitated by technological advances and the conversion of media content into digital formats, which make it easier to create, transmit and share high-quality unauthorized copies, on videotapes and DVDs, from pay per view through set-top boxes and through unlicensed broadcasts on free-to-air TV and the internet. In addition, the lack of internet specific legislation relating to trademark and copyright protection creates additional challenges for us in protecting our intellectual property rights in cyberspace.

Our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of factors in addition to our operating results, including the amount of taxable income in particular jurisdictions, the tax rates in those jurisdictions, tax treaties between jurisdictions, the manner in which, and extent to which, we transfer funds to and repatriate funds from our subsidiaries, accounting standards and changes in accounting standards, and future changes in tax law. There cannot be certainty that the relevant tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretation of relevant tax laws. If our tax positions are challenged by the relevant tax authorities, the imposition of additional taxes could require us to pay taxes that we currently do not collect or pay or increase the costs of our services to track and collect such taxes, which could increase our costs of operations or our effective tax rate and have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, in 2019, the Serbian Ministry of Finance Tax Authority (the “Serbian Tax Authority”) conducted a tax investigation of SBB Serbia for the year ended December 31, 2012 and issued a penalty of €21 million which has been deferred pending an appeal. In October 2020, the Ministry of Finance annulled this penalty and instructed the Serbian Tax Authority to restart its investigation.

In the event of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding up, liquidation, reorganization, administration or other bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of any of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, holders of their indebtedness and their trade creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to such subsidiary’s parent entity.

Each Guarantee will provide the holders of the New Notes with a direct claim against the relevant Guarantor. However, the Indenture includes language to the effect that each Guarantee and each security interest granted as well as any other obligation under Security Document will be limited so as to ensure compliance with local law. The Guarantees, security interests and other obligations will also be subject to applicable corporate and other laws and defenses, including foreign exchange laws. These laws and defenses may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or similar laws and regulations. In general, these laws prohibit companies from providing financial assistance to anyone for the purpose of acquiring their shares and limit the circumstances in which companies can transfer economic benefits to their shareholders outside the payment of properly declared dividends. They also provide for limitations that affect the rights of creditors generally in case an entity becomes insolvent. See “Limitations on _Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests” for more details regarding limitations_ on the Guarantees and Security Interests in the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Bulgaria. While similar laws apply in many jurisdictions, because several of the Guarantors and the substantial majority of the assets in which security interests are granted are located in CEE countries which have relatively young capital markets and where courts have limited experience with transactions of the type envisaged by the offering of the New Notes, there is considerable uncertainty as to how the relevant laws will be applied and ultimately to what extent the Guarantees and other security interests granted under the Indenture will be enforceable. For example, while the Slovenian law prohibiting companies from providing financial assistance to a third-party for the purpose of acquiring its shares applies only to joint stock companies, there is a significant risk that a court might extend this provision to the acquisition of shares of a joint stock company’s direct or indirect parents or to limited liability companies. Moreover, the Bosnian legislature adopted rules prohibiting limited liability companies from providing financial assistance to anyone for the purpose of acquiring their shares, thereby bringing the applicable legal regime in line with the rules applicable to joint stock companies. For those reasons, the risk of limitations on enforcement is greater in Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro than in European countries with more established legal systems and a long history of secured bond offerings. The Bulgarian limitations on the Guarantees granted by the Vivacom Guarantors and the Vivacom Collateral, including any thin capitalization and financial assistance issues that might limit the extent of guarantees and security by certain Vivacom Guarantors are set out in “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the _Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_ Moreover, certain transaction documents are governed by U.S. law. Judgments rendered by a U.S. court will generally not be directly enforceable in any of the jurisdictions in which the majority of the assets by which the bonds are secured are located. Instead, in many of these jurisdictions, as a pre-condition to enforcing a U.S. judgment, a local court will subject the judgment to a multi-factor test. Several of the factors the court will consider involve a considerable amount of discretion. Even if the court ultimately finds that the judgment is enforceable, the process may take a lengthy amount of time to complete. For all of these reasons, an investment in the New Notes involves unique risks that may not apply or apply differently in a more conventional secured ----- bond offering. If any of these risks materializes, your ability to collect payments of principal and interest under the New Notes may be materially adversely affected.

In addition, certain of our subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on the making of such distributions contained in their other financing arrangements, and such financing arrangements may actually prohibit the ability of these subsidiaries to move cash within the restricted group.

If an event of default occurs and the obligations under the New Notes are accelerated, the New Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral underlying their security interest at such time. The Issuer, the Company and its restricted subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future, which may also be secured by the relevant Collateral. If the value of the Collateral is less than the value of the claims of the holders of the New Notes together with the claims of the other secured creditors, those claims may not be satisfied in full. The Existing Notes and the Existing Revolving Credit Facility are secured, and the New Notes will be secured, with certain assets of the Company and the Company’s restricted subsidiaries. The Indenture allows the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to secure additional indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the Indenture (which may be structurally senior to the New Notes) with the property and assets of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries that do not secure the New Notes. The amount of indebtedness and the value of such assets and property could be significant. No appraisals of the Collateral have been prepared by us or on our behalf in connection with the offering of the New Notes. The fair market value of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, our ability to implement our business strategy, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, general economic conditions, the availability of buyers, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale and similar factors. The amount to be received upon a sale of any Collateral would be dependent on numerous factors, including but not limited to the actual fair market value of the Collateral at such time, general, market and economic conditions and the timing and the manner of the sale. There also can be no assurance that the Collateral will be saleable and, even if saleable, the timing of any liquidation or foreclosure is uncertain and there could be substantial delays. Industry regulations in certain jurisdictions in which we operate include restrictions on persons who may hold certain of our licenses, authorizations and consents that are necessary to operate our business. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of our business operations may be prohibited or only permitted to a limited group of investors eligible to hold such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, entry into the security documents, enforcement of the Collateral and any transfer of our operations may require, in certain jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings or might otherwise be ----- challenged. Such consents, approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result, enforcement may be delayed, and the value of the Collateral may be significantly decreased. To the extent that liens, rights or easements granted to third parties encumber assets located on property owned by us, such third parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to such liens that could adversely affect the value of the security and the ability of the relevant Security Agent to realize or foreclose on the security. By the nature of our business, some or all of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. In the event that a bankruptcy case is commenced by or against us, if the value of the Collateral is less than the amount of principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the New Notes and other obligations secured by the same Collateral, interest may cease to accrue on such New Notes from and after the date the bankruptcy petition is filed. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, we cannot assure you that the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the Collateral will be sufficient to pay the obligations due under such New Notes. With respect to any shares pledged to secure the New Notes, including the shares of the Issuer and certain Guarantors, such shares may also have limited value in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of this Collateral may decline over time. If the proceeds of the relevant Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the New Notes, the holders of such New Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) generally would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the remaining assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors. The Indenture also permits the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of the New Notes on the relevant Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness or third parties enjoy liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Indenture or the security documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the New Notes. Moreover, if we issue additional notes under the Indenture, holders of such additional notes would benefit from the same collateral as the holders of the New Notes being offered hereby, thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on the Collateral. The security interests in the Collateral and any additional security interests granted in the future are subject to certain agreed security principles applicable to such Collateral and the Existing Intercreditor Agreement. These agreed security principles set forth limitations on the requirement to grant security interests in favor of the New Notes in certain circumstances and may result in recoveries from security interests being limited or security not being granted at all over particular types or classes of assets. Furthermore, the Existing Intercreditor Agreement provides that proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral will be applied to repay claims of the lenders under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and creditors of other priority indebtedness in priority to the holders of the New Notes and other secured obligations. Holders of the New Notes may therefore receive less from the proceeds of the Collateral in an enforcement or insolvency scenario than if they were not required to share the proceeds.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

We can incur significant additional indebtedness and other obligations that may be secured by the same Collateral under the terms of the Indenture. The Existing Intercreditor Agreement provides that the agent of the creditor class who wishes to deliver an enforcement instruction must first consult with every agent or representative of the other creditor classes, certain creditors and the Security Agent for a period of not less than 30 days. After an initial consultation period, the Security Agent may act upon the instructions of an instructing group, which may be holders of 66[2]∕3% of the aggregate principal amount of the New Notes outstanding or creditors of 66[2]∕3% of the aggregate principal amount of super senior indebtedness (which includes drawn and undrawn commitments under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility). To the extent there are conflicting instructions, those on behalf of holders of the New Notes will prevail. However, in certain circumstances the creditors under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and any future counterparties to certain hedging arrangements and other ----- indebtedness secured by the Collateral in priority to the New Notes will have control over enforcement of the Collateral, including if (i) such creditors have not been fully repaid within six months of the end of the first 30 day consultation period, (ii) the Security Agent has not commenced any enforcement action within three-months of the end of the first 30 day consultation period or (iii) an insolvency event has occurred and the Security Agent has not commenced any enforcement action. These arrangements could result in the enforcement of the Collateral in a manner that results in lower recoveries by holders of the New Notes. Furthermore, other creditors not subject to the Existing Intercreditor Agreement could have interests that differ from the interests of holders of the New Notes and may elect to commence enforcement action against the Company or its subsidiaries at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the New Notes to do so. In addition, the Company or one or more of its subsidiaries could seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws, or the value of certain Collateral could otherwise be impaired, reduced or eliminated in value due to delays in enforcement.

The applicable hardening or voidance period for these new security interests may run from the moment such security interests are extended and perfected with respect to the New Notes or, if later, the issuance of such New Notes. At each time, if the security interest granted, perfected, extended or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the applicable hardening or voidance period, it may be declared void and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. In addition, the granting of shared security interests to secure existing and new indebtedness or future indebtedness, as the case may be, may restart or reopen hardening periods in certain jurisdictions in particular because the Indenture permits the release and retaking of security granted in favor of the New Notes in certain circumstances including in connection with the incurrence of future debt. If the grantor of such security interests were to become subject to a bankruptcy or winding up proceeding after the Issue Date, any mortgage or security interest in the Collateral delivered after the Issue Date would face a greater risk than security interests in place as of the Issue Date of being avoided by the grantor or by its trustee, receiver, liquidator, administrator or similar authority, or otherwise set aside by a court, as a preference under insolvency law.

Moreover, such multijurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly for creditors and often result in substantial uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors’rights.

The Indenture provides, and the Existing Intercreditor Agreement provides, that only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the Security Documents. As a consequence, holders of the New Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the New Notes, except through the Trustee, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the Collateral. In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests in the Collateral is subject to mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral are taken. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for an appropriation of certain pledged assets, but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the New Notes that are not identified as registered holders in a security document will be validly secured and/or can be enforced. This area of law is untested in the courts of certain of the relevant jurisdictions. In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests (and in particular, the requirements of accessority where the validity, extent and enforceability of security is linked to (i.e., is accessory to) the secured claim) and the enforceability of such security interests, the security agent and/or trustee is not able to hold the benefit of security on behalf of a group of creditors. Under Dutch law, and laws of certain other jurisdictions (including Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina), it is uncertain as to whether security interests can be granted to a party other than the creditor of the claim which is purported to be secured by such security interests. As a consequence, the Existing Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of parallel debt (“Parallel Debt”) obligations in favor of the Security Agent mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and Guarantors towards the holders of the New Notes under or in connection with the Existing Intercreditor Agreement (the “Principal Obligations”). The Dutch law security interests are granted to the Security Agent as security for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the Principal Obligations. As a result, the holders of the New Notes will bear some risks associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. In relation to the security interests located in other jurisdictions, the Security Agent might be appointed as joint and several creditor of secured obligations, including the Parallel Debt claim. The parallel debt construct has not been tested under laws of certain of the Guarantors’ jurisdictions, including (without limitation) Dutch law and Slovenian law and, to the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to secure the Parallel Debt are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the New Notes will not be entitled to demand performance as holders of the secured claim and will not (directly) receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the relevant Collateral.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to: - void or invalidate all or a portion of an Guarantor’s obligations under its guarantee or the security interests provided by the Issuer or such Guarantor; - direct that the Issuer and/or the holders of the New Notes return any amounts paid under a guarantee or any security document to the relevant Guarantor or to the respective Collateral provider or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors or the Collateral provider; and - take other action that is detrimental to holders of the New Notes. If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the New Notes and any Guarantee or security interest is found to be a preference, transaction at an undervalue, invalid charge, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure the holders of the New Notes that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the New Notes. In addition, the liability of each Guarantor under its guarantee of the New Notes and the liability of each Collateral provider will be limited to the amount that will result in such guarantee or security interest not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. The amount recoverable from a Guarantor or a Collateral provider under the security documents will also be limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what methodology a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor or each Collateral provider and whether a court would give effect to such attempted limitation. Also, there is a possibility that the entire guarantee or security interest may be set aside, in which case, the Guarantor’s or Collateral provider’s entire liability may be extinguished. In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts would likely, for example, need to find that, at the time the security interests were created, the Collateral provider: - issued such security interest with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or created such security after its insolvency; ----- - created such security interest in a situation where a prudent business person as a shareholder of such Collateral provider would have contributed equity to such Collateral provider or where the relevant beneficiary of the security interest knew or should have known that the Collateral provider was insolvent or a filing for insolvency had been made; or - received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the security interest on the basis that the security interest were incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly the Collateral provider’s benefit, or on some other basis and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the creation of the security interest, or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons, (ii) was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business transaction for which the Collateral provider’s assets were unreasonably small or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as and when they would become due. Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor or Collateral provider generally may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a guarantee or created any security if: - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets; - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due (and it is unable to get further credit); or - the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute. We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor or a Collateral provider was “insolvent” as of the date the Guarantees were issued or security was created or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that the Issuer, a Collateral provider or a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor, the Issuer or a Collateral provider was insolvent on the date the respective guarantee was issued or security interest was created, that payments to holders of the New Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds. For an overview of certain insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the Guarantees and the security interests, see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Our shareholders have and will continue to have, directly or indirectly, the power to affect our legal and capital structure, as well as the ability to elect and change our management and to approve other changes to our operations and to control the outcome of matters requiring action by shareholders. The interests of our shareholders may conflict with the interests of holders of the New Notes, particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. Investment funds advised by BC Partners are in the business of making investments in companies and may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestiture (including one or more divestitures of all or part of our business or sales of our shares which would result in changes to our shareholding structure), dividend distributions, financing or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to you as holders of the New Notes. In addition, our majority shareholder may pursue acquisition opportunities that are complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. Conversely, our shareholders may have an interest in not pursuing acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that could enhance our cash flow and be beneficial to you. Moreover, investment funds advised by BC Partners may, from time to time, acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly, or indirectly, with us.

Subject to certain restrictions, further series of additional notes may be issued under the Indenture which have different terms in respect of currency, interest rate and certain other matters. Such additional notes will also generally vote as a single class with other series of notes issued under the Indenture but may have interests that differ from the interests of holders of other series of notes issued ----- under the Indenture, including the New Notes. The New Notes and the Existing Fixed Rate Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, and the Existing Floating Rate Notes bear interest at a floating rate, and such notes have, or will have, among other things, different interest rates, different maturities, call schedules and call protection from each other and other features that may differ from additional notes issued under the Indenture in the future. As a result of these differences, the interests of holders of the New Notes and the interests of holders of additional notes could conflict. In addition, the holders of New Notes may be in a position to agree to certain terms in a consent solicitation that would be beneficial to such series of New Notes but adverse to the economic interest of the other series of notes issued under the Indenture; however, to the extent the relevant amendment or waiver is approved by the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the New Notes then outstanding under the Indenture (subject to the limited exceptions), all holders of Notes under the Indenture will be bound by such amendment.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

All of the directors and executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors are non-residents of the United States and substantially all of their assets are located outside of the United States. Although the Issuer and the Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on our directors and executive officers located outside the United States. In addition, as the assets of the Issuer and certain of the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries and those of their directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in the U.S. courts against them. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuer and the Guarantors may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. Additionally, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of foreign jurisdictions would enforce (i) judgments of United States courts obtained against the Issuer and the Issuer’s managing directors who are not residents of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the United States federal and state securities laws or (ii) in original actions brought in such foreign jurisdictions against us or such persons predicated upon the United States federal and state securities laws.

The SEC would not permit such limiting language to be included in a registration statement or a prospectus used in connection with an offering of securities registered under the Securities Act, or in a report filed under the Exchange Act. If a U.S. court (or any other court) were to give effect to such language, the recourse that investors in the New Notes may have against the independent auditors based on their reports or the consolidated financial statements to which they relate could be limited. The extent to which auditors have responsibility or liability to third parties is unclear under the laws of many jurisdictions, and the legal effect of these statements in their reports may be untested in the context of an offering of securities.

Unless and until definitive New Notes (each a “Definitive Registered Note”) are issued in exchange for bookentry interests in the Global Notes (which will only occur in very limited circumstances), owners of the bookentry interests will not be considered owners or holders of New Notes. The common depositary (or its nominee) for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the Global Notes representing the New Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the Global Notes will be made to the Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the Global Notes. After payment to Euroclear and Clearstream, the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee and the Paying Agent will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest, you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and if you are not a participant in Euroclear or Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder under the relevant indenture. See “Book-entry; Delivery and Form.” Unlike registered holders of the New Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon our solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from registered holders of the New Notes. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear or Clearstream or, if applicable, from a participant. We cannot assure you that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any requested actions on a timely basis. Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until Definitive Registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be restricted to acting through Euroclear or Clearstream.

Accordingly, we cannot assure you as to: - the liquidity of any market in the New Notes; - your ability to sell your New Notes; or - the prices at which you would be able to sell your New Notes. Future trading prices for the New Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the New Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the New Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. The trading market for the New Notes may attract different investors and this may affect the extent to which the New Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for the New Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the New Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. As a result, there is no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the New Notes.

In addition, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may have the right to purchase all outstanding Notes in connection with a tender offer, even if certain holders do not consent to the tender.","Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a “change of control” under the Indenture, the Issuer will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but not including) the date of repurchase. If a change of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in our Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Existing Intercreditor Agreement or our other existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A change of control may result in an event of default under, or require the repayment of or result in an acceleration of, our Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and other indebtedness. The repurchase of the New Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from its subsidiaries to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the New Notes following the occurrence of a change of control may be limited by our then existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a change of control occurs at a time when we are prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the New Notes, we may seek the consent of the holders or lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the New Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the New Notes upon the occurrence of a change of control, and we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such financing or that such financing would be on acceptable terms. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to repurchase any of the New Notes if so required would constitute a default under the Indenture, which could, in turn, constitute a default under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the PIK Indenture and certain other indebtedness.

Furthermore, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of control under the Indenture will be deemed not to be a change of control if the consolidated leverage ratio is less than a certain specified level. See “Description of the New Notes—Certain Definitions—Specified Change of Control Event.” In addition, in connection with certain tender offers for the New Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third-party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases, all of the relevant Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third-party will have the right to redeem the New Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to other holders of Notes.

Financial information for the seven months ended July 31, 2020 is derived by taking the financial data for nine months ended September 30, 2020, and subtracting the financial information for the two months ended September 30, 2020 (which has not been reviewed or audited). The financial information is prepared in Bulgarian levs (BGN). (b) Amounts were converted using the BGN/EUR exchange rate of BGN 1.9558 to EUR 1.00, the pegged rate for the period. (c) The adjustments presented have been made to reclassify Vivacom line items to conform to the Company’s basis of preparation. Such adjustments have no effect on profit for the period reported. (d) The purpose of the adjustment is to illustrate the effects of: (i) eliminating the effect of transactions between Vivacom and Viva Telecom Bulgaria EOOD The Group acquired Viva Telecom Bulgaria EOOD (formerly, Viva Telecom Bulgaria OOD) in the Vivacom Acquisition. Viva Telecom Bulgaria EOOD is a holding company of the Vivacom Group but does not itself prepare consolidated financial information. The pro forma financial information of Vivacom included herein is based on the Vivacom Unaudited Interim Financial Statements and therefore certain adjustments are made to eliminate the effect of transactions between Vivacom and Viva Telecom Bulgaria EOOD. An adjustment was made to eliminate intercompany transactions, comprising an interest income amounting to €6,262 thousand and reversal of impairment cost amounting to €303 thousand and related tax effects. (ii) purchase price allocation The purchase price allocation was finalized as of December 31, 2020 and therefore the Company Audited Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, include the fair value adjustments that have been made to acquired assets and liabilities (including any associated deferred tax effects), and differences between total consideration paid for the acquisition and the estimated fair values of the net assets of Vivacom were recorded as goodwill. The Company identified and measured significant identifiable assets such as: trade name, customer base—fixed services, customer base—mobile services, licenses, software and distribution network. The value of the items of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets increased significantly. As a result of the newly identified intangible assets and the significant increase to the value of the existing items of property, plant and equipment, additional amortization and depreciation charges were estimated and added as adjustments to the of Vivacom financial data for the seven months ended July 31, 2020. The amount of additional amortization and depreciation was estimated based on the value allocated to specific assets and the remaining useful life of ----- those assets. The adjustments for the additional amortization and depreciation charges are amounting to €44,382 thousand and related tax benefit amounting to €4,438 thousand. (e) The adjustments presented have been made to align Vivacom’s accounting policies with IFRS as adopted and applied by the Company under its currently applied accounting policies. Vivacom (i) capitalizes subscriber acquisition costs for contracts below one year and (ii) capitalizes portability costs, while such costs are expensed as incurred by the Company and (iii) for related tax effects of the foregoing.

382_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1127,THE COMPANY’S MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,1127.1,Our Business Overview,1127.1.1,,"We are the leading cable and media player in Southeastern Europe, providing services to approximately 3.7 million homes as of March 31, 2021. We are the leading distributor of Pay-TV in our core markets of Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and the number two distributor in Montenegro. As of March 31, 2021, we provided services to approximately 10.9 million RGUs and analog and digital cable Pay-TV services to approximately 1.9 million unique subscribers. United Group’s revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was €439.4 million and UG Adjusted EBITDA was €179.2 million. The Group had Run-Rate Revenue for the annualized last two quarters ended March 31, 2021 of €1,916.4 million and Run-Rate Last Two Quarter Annualized Adjusted EBITDA for March 31, 2021 was €706.3 million. The Combined Group is the clear multi-play leader in its footprint, with market leading positions in Pay-TV, broadband internet and fixed-line and mobile-telephony in Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Bulgaria, Croatia and, following the Forthnet Acquisition, Greece. The Combined Group’s addressable market comprised 13.4 million households as of December 31, 2020. We have grown rapidly through both acquisitions and organic growth. In July 2020, we acquired Vivacom, the market leading integrated telecommunications operator in Bulgaria, based on total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, which is the leading operator in fixed-line telephony services and broadband services, the number three provider of mobile-telephony services and the number three provider of Pay-TV, in each case, by number of subscribers as of March 31, 2021. The Vivacom Acquisition increased our addressable market by approximately 35% in terms of population, and the addition of Vivacom’s subscriber base more than doubled our existing subscriber base. In March 2020, we also acquired Tele2 Croatia, the third largest telecommunications operator in Croatia, based on mobile revenues as of March 31, 2021, through which we offer mobile services in Croatia. In November 2020, we completed the acquisition of a controlling interest in Forthnet S.A., a prominent telecom operator and Pay-TV provider in Greece, which marked our entry into the Greek market and will strengthen our position as an industry leader in Southeastern Europe. In January 2021, we acquired Bulgaria’s largest multi-platform media company, Nova Broadcasting Group EOOD, from Advance Media Group EAD, providing a strong base for our content offering in Bulgaria. In July 2021, we signed an agreement to acquire a majority interest in Optima Telekom, a Croatian telecom operator offering a broad range of fixed internet and pay-TV services. Subject to its completion, the Optima Telekom Acquisition will allow us to further expand our presence in the Croatian market and offer a full range of telecommunication services, including pay-TV, through our existing infrastructure in the country. We offer a diverse and differentiated line of products and services. We are the leading distributor of satellite (“DTH”) Pay-TV across Southeastern Europe, with Pay-TV product and service offerings in each of Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia and Montenegro, where we use our Total TV platform to serve subscribers both inside and outside of our cable footprint to deliver content across the entire region, including rural areas. Following the Vivacom Acquisition, we also provide Pay-TV services in Bulgaria and are the leading IPTV provider in Bulgaria, while the Nova Broadcasting Group Acquisition strengthened our content offering in Bulgaria. Following the Forthnet Acquisition, we also provide cable and DTH services in Greece. In addition to our cable-based and satellite-based services, we offer mobile-telephony services in Slovenia, Bulgaria and Croatia. We provide 4G LTE coverage to almost the entire population in each of these countries, and we are rolling out 5G networks across our mobile-telephony footprint. On September 21, 2020, we announced the commercial launch of our 5G network in Bulgaria, and to that end in May 2021, we secured a 20-year license for 100 MHz spectrum frequencies in the 3.6 GHz band. We also in April 2021 ----- secured 15-year spectrum licenses in Slovenia for 5G frequencies, and commenced deployment and commercial launch of 5G 3600 MHz in Slovenia in June 2021. We are participating in a 5G spectrum auction in Croatia this year. Our core telecommunications business is also complemented by our two OTT distribution platforms that customers can access through internet based streaming: EON, our regional OTT platform, which enables customers connected to our competitors’ broadband internet connections outside of our cable footprint to access our attractive portfolio of Pay-TV channels, and NetTV Plus, our international OTT platform, which delivers ethnic and local language content to the ex-Yugoslav diaspora around the world. In July 2020, we launched Shoppster, our regional e-commerce online-shopping platform, which offers more than 20 popular product categories, including electronics, home and gardening, tools, fashion, items for children and kitchen appliances. Shoppster is available as an integrated online and TV shopping platform in Serbia and Slovenia. Through our in-house content business, we produce distinctive and attractive in-house media content for our Pay-TV channels across multiple key genres that have historically driven Pay-TV subscriptions. These channels include Southeastern Europe’s most popular family of branded Pay-TV sports channels, as well as popular movie channels, children’s channels, a 24/7 news channel, music channels and other specialized channels, which we continue to expand both organically and through acquisitions. We currently produce over 40% of the total content in our national (terrestrial) and cable operations, and our programs typically receive ratings of between 30% to 60% in the markets in which they are available. The Group also has in-house media and content production in Greece. We believe that our market leading content portfolio differentiates us from our competitors, has enabled strong growth in our business and provides us with predictable third-party carriage fees. As part of our media business, we also provide advertising services and digital production and distribution. Our Nova TV Croatia channel has strong local content production and profitability, with an audience share of 40% and market share by advertising revenue of 50%. Nova BH and Nova M have appealing content, such as popular national team football events until 2022, such as the Euro Cup qualifiers, Euro Cup, World Cup qualifiers and League of Nations. In March 2019, we launched Nova S in Serbia. Nova S is a channel offering high-quality local production series, sports, talk shows with well-known national presenters and high-quality international productions, fully exclusive to SBB, Total TV and EON. The Nova Broadcasting Group Acquisition makes us a major content player in Bulgaria by adding Nova BG’s media platform comprising ten television channels, including NOVA TV, which broadcasts throughout Bulgaria, Bulgaria’s largest online platform, Net Info, which reaches on average 80% of the Bulgarian population each month, and four radio stations. In addition to our own content, as a result of our pan regional presence and well established distribution network, we are a distribution partner of choice for premium regional and international content owners, such as Discovery/Eurosport, Viacom, AXN, CNN, HBO, Fox and Universal, and sports rights owners, such as the English Premier League, Spanish Football League LaLiga, 2020 UEFA European Championship qualifiers, 2020 UEFA European Championship, 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, UEFA League of Nations, ATP, Formula 1, Euroleague, and Moto GP, which we believe allows us to consistently obtain high-quality content and attractive payment terms. Nova BG holds licenses to offer compelling content in Bulgaria through distributors such as CBS Intenrational, the Walt Disney Company, Columbia Pictures and Paramount Pictures, as well as popular sports content such as the English Premier League football, Euro Cup qualifiers and the Euro Cup and Formula One racing. We believe these providers partner with us because of our well-known brands, large network and our focus on Southeastern Europe. We operate most of our business across eight countries in Southeastern Europe: Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Greece. These countries have a combined population of approximately 40 million, distributed across approximately 13.4 million households as of December 31, 2020, and represent the second-largest CEE market after Poland. Despite economic differences, many of these countries share a joint history and form a single market in which small local differences are overshadowed by the influence of similarities in cultural preferences and language across the region and are characterized by growing Pay-TV and broadband markets that are currently underpenetrated relative to some other CEE and Western European markets. We are the leading multi-play provider in Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Bulgaria, where we combine our services into packages, or bundles, which offer subscribers the convenience of being able to purchase television, broadband internet and telephony services from a single provider, and provides us with significant opportunities to cross-sell our products. ----- We believe that we are well-positioned to maintain our market leading positions in the Pay-TV and cable broadband internet markets in Slovenia, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to further increase our market shares, as we differentiate our product offerings through one of the highest download speeds in our broadband markets, access to desirable media content, a well invested network and high-quality customer service, which has led to relatively low churn rates which we believe demonstrate customer loyalty. We also believe that we are well-positioned to continue to grow in our region, and build on our expansion into Bulgaria and Greece. Our customers view the telecommunications products and services that we offer as part of their everyday lives, which results in recurring, high demand for our products and makes our business more resilient to macro-economic disruptions when compared to other discretionary products and services. For example, during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic our products and services have been instrumental in providing connectivity and entertainment, as an increasing number of people began to work or study remotely and spent significant amounts of time at home, which resulted in a significant increase in our voice and data traffic between March and May 2020. In particular, over this period, our fixed data traffic increased at rates between 50% and 70%, while fixed voice traffic increased at rates between 50% and 85%, depending on the country. In addition, our mobile data and voice traffic increased at rates between 30% and 40%, depending on the country. Traffic levels decreased during the summer months and started increasing again as new lockdowns were implemented in various countries. To accommodate such higher customer demand, we increased capacity on network elements and interconnections. In this recurring, high demand environment, we believe we offer superior products, faster broadband speeds and higher quality content than many of our competitors.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

We continually evaluate the suite of products and services we provide to our subscribers to ensure that we remain competitive with other providers in our markets and have an opportunity to increase our subscriber base and the number of products we sell to our subscribers. We accomplish this through product innovation, investments in technology and acquisitions of complementary businesses. For example, we have expanded our product offering by introducing fixed-line services to offer multi-play packages in Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro, including pay television, broadband internet access, fixed-line telephony, as well as mobiletelephony services in Slovenia and following the completion of the acquisition of Tele2 Croatia in March 2020, in Croatia. Following completion of the Vivacom Acquisition in July 2020, we also offer pay television, broadband internet access, fixed-line telephony, and mobile-telephony services in Bulgaria. Following the Forthnet Acquisition in November 2020, we also offer telecommunications and Pay-TV services in Greece. We believe that media and communications services customers will increasingly choose bundled products because of the convenience and enhanced value resulting from obtaining TV, broadband internet and telephony services from a single provider for one price. As of March 31, 2021, 85% of our customer base in Slovenia, 79% of our customer base in Serbia, 87% of our customer base in Bosnia and Herzegovina and 54% of our customer base in Bulgaria subscribed for one of our multi-play packages (our customer base is calculated based on unique cable subscribers by bundle). We seek to be the leader in our markets in pay television content and have entered into long-term strategic partnerships with key international and regional content owners. We have also acquired leading regional content owners in key television sub-segments (sports, lifestyle, children and films), such as providers of the Sport Klub family of channels (which includes Sport Klub, Golf Klub and our fishing and hunting channels), N1, Fight Channel, Pikaboo and Cinemania. Our ability to maintain the quality of our content impacts our ability to sell our pay television offerings, as well as bundled packages. Our product mix can also impact our margins. For example, our mobile-telephony business and our content business generally have lower margins compared to our cable-based business. Our success in growing these businesses may impact our product mix and therefore may affect UG Adjusted EBITDA margins.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

We regularly review the prices of ----- our products and services, however, and in the past have adjusted our subscription fees as necessary in line with inflation, changes in foreign exchange rates or in response to market conditions and content costs. Changes in the pricing of our products and services will impact the revenues and margins that we generate from these products and services and impact our ability to attract new customers. For example, our multi-play bundles offer subscribers higher value in terms of channels, speeds functionality and add on features. The pricing of all our services, including our multi-play bundles, is dependent on market conditions, pricing by competitors with similar offerings and the perceived quality of our products versus other products. In relation to our Basic TV package, we were also subject to price regulation in Serbia until January 2017. From January 2017, the price of our Basic TV package in Serbia is no longer subject to price regulation. However, such price regulation might be reinstated in the future, and we regularly monitor the media market in Serbia to stay aware of market conditions which may lead to price regulation.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

In addition to competitive alternatives, churn levels may be affected by changes in our prices or our competitors’ prices, our level of subscriber satisfaction, subscriber mortality and the relocation of subscribers, as well as from the termination of agreements. An increase in churn may lead to increased costs and reduced revenues when subscribers cancel our services as we incur additional marketing and advertising costs to find new subscribers. Increasing demand for attractive content and higher broadband speeds allows us to increase the prices at which we provide these services while maintaining relatively low churn rates. We believe our relatively low churn rates provide us with recurring cash flows and visibility with respect to future revenues. We have historically experienced low churn rates in our television, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony businesses, and the churn we have experienced in these businesses has primarily been driven by customers moving outside of our current geographic area of services as well as termination of services due to their inability to pay, with only a limited amount of churn driven by competition. We believe that launching telephony in our markets, further driving digitization, providing our subscribers with multi-play packages (including quad-play in Slovenia, as described in more detail below), expanding our cable footprint to broaden our geographic reach and benefiting from increasing disposable incomes in the region (reducing the likelihood of customers’ bad debt), will allow us to maintain low churn rates for cable Pay-TV. In addition, we believe that as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our churn rates will likely decrease as customers are unlikely or unable to easily migrate to another provider during the pandemic. The churn rates for our mobile post-paid subscribers are higher than the churn rates for our fixed-line telephony services, as it is easier for mobile subscribers to switch to our competitors as there are no infrastructure limitations. Similarly, the churn rate of mobile prepaid subscribers is relatively higher because of the non-contractual nature of the relationship with such subscribers. We believe, however, that we have developed an attractive suite of fixed mobile convergence services in Slovenia which, among other things, has had the effect of reducing the churn of our mobile post-paid subscribers in Slovenia. Following the consummation of the acquisition of Tele2 Croatia in March 2020, we are leveraging on our experience and the lessons learned from integrating Tušmobil to guide our integration of Tele2 Croatia. Since our acquisition of Tušmobil, our number of quad-play subscribers in Slovenia has increased to 38% of our subscribers in Slovenia as of March 31, 2021, from 1% of our subscribers in Slovenia prior to the acquisition. The blended annual churn rate of Telemach Slovenia’s mobile post-paid subscribers as of March 31, 2021, was 11.5%, compared to 11.2% as of January 31, 2017. We define blended annual churn as net lost subscribers (the number of customers that either on a voluntary or involuntary basis no longer subscribe for a certain service) divided by the number of all unique cable subscribers at the beginning of period, which result is then annualized. We have been using the principles learned through our acquisition of Tušmobil and our experience providing mobile services in Slovenia to inform the operation of our mobile-telephony business in Bulgaria following the completion of the Vivacom Acquisition in July 2020 and in Croatia following the Tele2 Croatia Acquisition completed in March 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Most of our costs, such as a portion of our network operations, customer care, billing and administration costs, are relatively fixed, while a portion of our marketing and customer services cost is variable. Our content acquisition costs are mostly fixed and a decreasing portion of these costs are subscriber based. Where possible, we aim to negotiate fixed rate content costs. This approach allows us to anticipate the input price of our content and price our products accordingly. The costs associated with the growth of our business, such as RGU acquisition costs, which are primarily comprised of campaign costs and sales costs for attracting new subscribers, are variable costs. A large portion of our costs is content costs, accounting for 18% of our operating expenses (not including depreciation and amortization of intangible assets) for the three months ended March 31, 2021. While we own a portion of our content, we are dependent on broadcasters and other content owners for most of our programming. We pay license fees to several regional and international broadcasters in order to broadcast their programs. For on demand content purchased by our subscribers, we generally pay a revenue share of the retail price, subject, for certain on demand content, to fixed minimum guarantees. For packaged on demand content (subscription video on demand), we pay on a per subscriber basis, sometimes with minimum guarantees. We generally expect that our content costs (above the minimum amounts) will increase in line with increased revenues from digital Pay-TV and on demand content. In the past we have successfully obtained rebates and discounts for our content, but these may not continue in the future. We pay fees to satellite operators to uplink and transmit our content to our DTH subscribers, and we also use other network operators to connect telephone calls of our customers to customers of their respective networks (interconnection). Generally, the amount we pay in interconnection fees in any period will depend on the level of usage of our services. Our staff cost is impacted by the number of personnel we employ, the experience levels at which such persons are employed and increases in salaries and bonuses due to performance factors. Labor costs of technicians, spent on the construction and upgrade of our network and acquisition of subscribers, are capitalized as tangible and intangible assets. RGU acquisition costs include campaign costs and sales costs. We aim to recover RGU acquisition costs over the duration of the service contract. Factors that contribute to successful recovery of RGU acquisition costs include our operational efficiency, the density of our subscriber base and our direct relationships with our subscribers, which enables us not to rely on intermediaries to interact with our customers.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

We incur capital expenditure charges in periods over which these upgrades are made, with the aim of recouping these investments through increased revenues and profitability. In particular, we expect certain communications technologies that are currently under development, 5G technology in particular, to become increasingly important in our markets. We successfully tested and are rolling out our next generation 5G networks across our mobile-telephony footprint. In Slovenia, 5G 3600 MHz deployment and commercial launch began in June 2021, following a successful frequency auction result in April 2021. In Bulgaria, 5G has been launched commercially using 4G 1900 MHz spectrum in September 2020, which was the first available 5G service in the market, and in May 2021, Vivacom has secured a 20-year license for 100 MHz spectrum frequencies in the 3.6 GHz band. In Croatia, the first deployment of the 5G C-Band is expected during the third or fourth quarters of 2021, and Telemach Croatia is participating in the 5G spectrum auction in Croatia. We believe that significant investments in 5G technology will be critical to remain competitive in the mobile market and meet our customers’ needs. Our ability to compete effectively and maintain or increase our customer base depends on our ability to anticipate and react quickly to technological developments and evolving industry standards and develop successful new and enhanced products and services to adapt to changes in our market. We invest in new or enhanced technologies, products or services in periods over which industry standards change, or to upgrade our technologies proactively. Additionally, we incur capital expenditure costs relating to the replacement of existing equipment. We expect to incur substantial capital expenditure costs in the future relating to new 4G and 5G frequencies and the installation of new equipment.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Our revenues in Slovenia, Montenegro and Greece are generated in euro. ----- SBB Serbia and Telemach BH record their financial results in the Serbian dinar and the Bosnian and Herzegovinian mark, respectively, which are then translated into euros in preparing our consolidated financial statements. In the three months ended March 31, 2021, 72% of our revenue was generated in euros or currencies pegged to the euro, with 15% of our revenue generated in Serbian dinars and 13% of revenue generated in Croatian kuna. While the Bosnian and Herzegovinian mark is pegged against the euro at a fixed exchange rate of BAM 1.9558 per €1.00 and the Bulgarian lev is pegged against the euro at a fixed exchange rate of BGN 1.9558 per €1.00, the Serbian dinar freely fluctuates against the euro. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the value of the Serbian dinar remained stable relative to the euro. However, due to the historic indexation of the Serbian dinar against the German mark, which was replaced by the euro in 2002, we believe the Serbian consumer price index closely tracks the depreciation of the Serbian dinar against the euro which has historically allowed us to “pass through”a portion of the impact of the depreciation of the dinar to our customers. We believe that our pricing strategy reflects this “pass through” principle. In the three months ended March 31, 2021, the value of the Croatian kuna increased approximately 1% relative to the euro compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020. We present our consolidated financial statements in euro. As a result, we must translate the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses of all of our operations with a functional currency other than the euro into euros at then applicable exchange rates. Consequently, increases or decreases in the value of these currencies against the euro may affect the value of our assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses with respect to our non-euro businesses in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. These translations could significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods and result in significant changes to the carrying value of our assets, liabilities and stockholders’ equity. Additionally, certain of our expenses, primarily content and satellite costs, are denominated in euros and U.S. dollars. Where we are unable to match sales received in foreign currencies with costs paid in the same currency, our results of operations are impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations. A substantial portion of our indebtedness is denominated in euros. Based on our lack of any material change in exposure to the U.S. dollar in the three months ended March 31, 2021, we did not enter into any additional currency hedge agreements during the three months ended March 31, 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

As a result, growth in our markets has been higher than in certain CEE and Western Europe jurisdictions. We believe this is primarily due to the increasing importance of high-quality broadband internet and an increasing convergence of our regions with the EU. Slovenia is a more mature market, with subscriber rates similar to the CEE region, and as a result, growth in that market will depend more on our ability to effectively compete with other market participants and to continue to offer high-quality customer propositions. Following the completion of the Tele2 Croatia Acquisition in March 2020, we also have operations in Croatia. As a member of the EU with relatively high GDP per capita and growth rates, Croatia is an attractive market for our continued expansion. The Croatian mobile market is characterized by high market stability, as it has a low level of fragmentation and disruption, with only three MNOs in the market (including Telemach Croatia), and the country’s telecommunications infrastructure is highly dependent on mobile access, with one of the highest mobile ARPU among CEE countries. We believe that our growth in this market will depend on several factors, such as the ability to expand our territorial coverage as well as improve the quality of our network and customer support services, including through investments to increase our capacity and quality levels and through the continued development of our digital and sales channels. In addition, following the completion of the Vivacom Acquisition in July 2020, we also have operations in Bulgaria. Bulgaria experienced relatively strong GDP growth at an average rate of 3.3% per year between 2017 and 2019 (according to the BNSI), but faces economic and political challenges in sustaining this growth. Following the Forthnet Acquisition, we also have operations in Greece. The Greek telecommunications market is characterized by intense competition. The market is concentrated among four main operators with a focus on fixed-mobile convergent offerings. The total fixed-line market, comprised of approximately 4.8 million subscribers, has stable with limited fixed-to-mobile substitution, while the broadband market, comprised of approximately 4.2 million subscribers continues to grow at the expense of voice-only lines. NGA subscribers (those with broadband speeds of greater than 30 Mbps) comprise approximately one-third of total broadband subscribers, but this level remains low compared with the EU average of over 60%. Pay-TV penetration is also ----- low compared to EU averages, with 26% of Greek households subscribing to Pay-TV. In Greece, the majority of Pay-TV subscribers are served through DTH technology, while the remainder is served through IPTV. In each of the aforementioned markets, a number of factors will impact the rate of growth of pay television, broadband internet and telephony industries, including economic conditions, political stability, increases in infrastructure and an increased distribution of wealth. Furthermore, these industries may not grow at the same rate as they have in the past.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

We are generally free from retail price regulation other than, prior to January 2017, with respect to our Basic TV package in Serbia, due to SBB Serbia’s prior SMP in the Serbian Pay-TV market. Since January 2017, we are no longer considered a significant market participant in the Pay-TV market in Serbia, thus our Basic TV package is no longer subject to price regulation, although this may change in the future, and we regularly monitor the market to stay aware of market conditions which may lead to price regulation. In Croatia, we are currently subject to price regulation only with respect to fixed and mobile termination rates charged by operators to each other for interconnection services, which are regulated in the whole European Union. In addition, in Serbia we are subject to price regulation only to the extent we are required to provide access to our wholesale network. SBB Serbia is, however, currently deemed to have SMP on the wholesale market for call termination in public telephone networks and the wholesale market of central access at a fixed location for mass market products, which imposes certain regulatory obligations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and _Industry—We may become subject to more extensive regulation due to our scale.” We also implemented price_ increases in January 2018, which the Serbian Commission for Protection of Competition investigated, but ultimately accepted. In addition, we may be subject to conditions imposed in connection with competition authority clearances as we continue to expand our business through bolt on, value accretive acquisitions and we may be subject to market power analysis from the relevant regulators, which could force us to adjust our prices or sell various parts of our businesses.

For instance, in Serbia, taxable income can be reduced in the same proportion as capital expenditure for the year in Serbia divided by the carrying amount of assets in Serbia. Due to our significant capital expenditure in Serbia in 2016, we believe we have satisfied the requirements to be granted a ten year tax beneficial status, expiring in 2025, and we recorded beneficial tax treatment for our SBB Serbia segment for the years ending December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and the three months ended March 31, 2021. Additionally, under thin capitalization rules in Serbia, interest and related costs under intercompany loans are recognized as deductible expenses to the extent the intercompany loans do not exceed four times the borrower’s equity. In 2017 and 2018, SBB Serbia did not capitalize any intercompany loans. On December 27, 2018, the Serbian Tax Authority notified United Group that it had begun a tax investigation of SBB Serbia for the year ended December 31, 2012. The Serbian Tax Authority issued a decision in March 2019 that it had recharacterized interest payments made by SBB Serbia under an intragroup loan agreement (and certain debt and equity conversions) as dividends, which would have been subject to a 5% withholding tax, and found a total contingent liability in respect of this decision amounting to €21 million, including late interest. On October 12, 2020, the Serbian Ministry of Finance annulled the Serbian Tax Authority’s decision and instructed the Serbian Tax Authority to restart the procedure, taking into account the arguments provided in SSB Serbia’s appeal. The Serbian Tax Authority has also informed SBB Serbia that it is opening a tax review for the years 2013 through 2016. SBB Serbia intends to continue contesting the Serbian Tax Authority’s findings. For more information, see “Our Business—Legal Proceedings—Investigation by the Serbian Tax Authority.” Furthermore, in Slovenia, Telemach Slovenia may use a tax allowance for investment in equipment and intangible assets (available for investments made after January 1, 2008), whereby the tax allowance is limited to 40% of the value of the assets, up to the amount of the tax base. In 2018, 2019 and 2020, Telemach Slovenia used the tax allowance for investments in the amount of €11.5 million, €10.5 million and €9.3 million, respectively. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, a taxpayer who invests more than BAM 20.0 million (€10.2 million) in production assets (property, plant and equipment) within the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina for five ----- consecutive years is relieved from 50% of taxation on such investments for a period of five years, starting from the first year in which it has invested at least BAM 4 million (€2.0 million). Pursuant to this provision, in 2018, 2019 and 2020, Telemach BH received a tax allowance for investments in the amount of BAM 6.1 million (€3.1 million), BAM 6.8 million (€3.5 million) and BAM 2.7 million (€1.4 million), respectively. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, a taxpayer receives a tax allowance when it employs certain types of employees, and in 2018, 2019 and 2020, Telemach BH received a tax allowance for certain new employees in the amount of BAM 1.3 million (€0.7 million), BAM 2.0 million (€1.0 million) and BAM 2.9 million (€1.5 million), respectively. In Greece, the corporate income tax rate was set at 24% in 2019. From January 1, 2020, withholding taxes on dividends were reduced from 10% to 5%, and on July 1, 2020, Greece implemented a participation exemption for capital gains from the sale of Greek and EU subsidiaries. For internet services, customers are charged a 5% tax on top of internet subscriptions (in addition to VAT of 24%). In addition, a 10% tax on top of Pay-TV subscriptions for Greek operators (in addition to VAT of 24%) has been imposed, although this has been suspended until September 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

While IFRS 15 became effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted, we commenced the recognition of revenue broadly in line with IFRS 15 for periods starting January 1, 2016 as debundling of services was applied beginning on January 1, 2016. Other standards in compliance with IFRS 15 were applied from January 1, 2018. There were two primary changes that we implemented in accordance with IFRS 15. First, with respect to handset sales that are subsidized by ongoing service fees, we used to recognize revenue only in the amount of cash received for such mobile phones. However, under the new standard, we allocate a contract’s transaction price based on the relative stand-alone selling price of the mobile phone. More revenue is recognized upfront as a result. As a result of implementing this policy in 2016, we have not seen a material impact on our reported financial results for periods that commenced after January 1, 2018 when IFRS 15 was fully implemented. Concurrently, we corrected an accounting policy regarding discounts to contracts. Contracts where a customer pays for equipment, such as handsets, in installments over a period of more than one year (in addition to ongoing services) may be deemed to have a significant financing component, particularly in the case of discounts during the first few months of a contract. The majority of new or renewed contracts provide for discounts during the first few months of a contract. Under IFRS, such a discount during the first few months is ignored, and the total price of the contract is spread out over the entire contract period. Furthermore, revenue is adjusted to reflect the time value of money. Second, we charge non-refundable service activation fees to all new customers at the beginning of their contract. These fees do not transfer goods or services to the customer, but are more administrative in nature and do not render a service or provide a benefit to the customer. Under IFRS 15, such fees should be spread over the entire contract period as they are related to the performance obligation of providing a mobile service, which results in a contractual liability at the beginning of the contract on the balance sheet. _IFRS 9 Financial Instruments_ IFRS 9 replaces the existing guidance in IAS 39 (Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement) that relates to the recognition, classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, derecognition of financial instruments, impairment of financial assets and hedge accounting. IFRS 9 also includes revised guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments, including a new expected credit loss model for calculating impairment on financial assets and the new general hedge accounting requirements. Most IAS 39 requirements concerning classification and measurement of financial liabilities and de recognition of financial instruments were transferred to IFRS 9 unchanged. The standard introduces the following categories of financial assets: measured at amortized cost, measured at fair value through profit and loss and measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. Classification is performed on initial recognition and depends on the business model for managing of financial assets adopted by the Group and on the characteristics of the contractual cash flows from such instruments. ----- The adoption of IFRS 9 from January 1, 2018 resulted in changes in accounting policies and adjustments to the amounts recognized in our accumulated loss. _IFRS 16 Leases_ IFRS 16 introduced for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 a single, on balance sheet lease accounting model for lessees. A lessee recognizes a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. There are recognition exemptions for short-term leases and leases of low value items available on a voluntary basis. Lessor accounting remains similar to the previous standard—i.e., lessors continue to classify leases as finance or operating leases. Under IFRS 16, we recognize new assets and liabilities for our operating leases of satellite capacity, office facilities, parts of our infrastructure and base stations and the right-of-use of water and land. The nature of expenses related to those leases changed because we recognized a depreciation charge for right-of-use assets and interest expense on lease liabilities. Previously, we recognized operating lease expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, and recognized assets and liabilities only to the extent that there was a timing difference between actual lease payments and the expense recognized. There has been no significant impact for our finance leases in which we are the lessor. We applied the simplified transition approach and did not restate comparative amounts for the year prior to first adoption. Right-of-use assets for property leases were measured on transition as if the new rules had always been applied. All other right-of-use assets have been measured at the amount of the lease liability on adoption (adjusted for any prepaid or accrued lease expenses). _IFRIC 23_ In June 2017, the IFRS Interpretation Committee issued IFRIC 23, which clarifies the accounting treatment of uncertainties in income taxes, specifically in relation to taxable profit or loss, tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates, when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments under IAS 12. IFRIC 23 states that an entity should assume that the applicable taxation authority will have full knowledge of all relevant information when examining amounts reported to it. An entity therefore has to consider whether it is probable that the applicable authority will accept a certain tax treatment in the entity’s income tax filing and either adopt an approach consistent with the tax treatment in its income tax filings or use the expected value of the tax treatment when determining taxable profit or loss, tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates. IFRIC 23 is applicable for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 with early adoption permitted. In adopting IFRIC 23, we applied a modified retrospective approach whereby the cumulative effect of initially applying IFRIC 23, if any, should be recognized in opening equity at the date of initial application. As part of our adoption of IFRIC 23, we have not identified any additional material income tax uncertainties for which we would be required to recognize a related tax liability. In the three months ended March 31, 2021, we have also applied certain other amendments to existing accounting standards that did not have any impact on the amounts recognized in prior periods and that are not expected to significantly affect current or future periods.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

The transaction closed in December 2017. In 2018, we acquired: - Nova TV d.d., a provider of full format, general entertainment flagship stations geared towards mainstream audiences as well as a range of thematic channels, from CME B.V. in the Nova TV Croatia Acquisition, which acquisition completed on July 31, 2018, for a total consideration of €86.4 million (including net working capital adjustments); and - 100% of the outstanding shares (excluding treasury shares) in Direct Media, a leading media buying agency in Serbia, which acquisition completed on September 4, 2018. The transaction included Direct Media’s operations in Serbia, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Albania, as well as the company’s terrestrial TV stations Pink BiH and Pink Montenegro (which we have rebranded Nova BH and Nova M, respectively). Direct Media is a full service media agency, offering integrated communication, advertising and media services to local and international partners. In 2018, we sold our Total TV operations in Croatia in connection with the Nova TV Croatia Acquisition. The total consideration was €3 million, and the transaction closed on January 12, 2018. In connection with the sale, we entered into a one year transitional support agreement. In 2019, we acquired: - Netlogic d.o.o. Beograd, a Serbian IT services company, for a total consideration of €2.0 million.

The transaction closed on November 1, 2019; and - FMC Datacenter d.o.o., a Slovenian web hosting company, for a total consideration of €0.6 million. The transaction closed on December 31, 2019. In 2020, we acquired: - Tele2 Croatia, the third largest MNO in Croatia, for cash consideration of €126.0 million. We financed the acquisition through the issuance of €207.0 million in aggregate principal amount of additional Existing 2024 SSNs. The acquisition closed on March 3, 2020. - Vivacom, the largest telecommunications operator in Bulgaria by revenue, for cash consideration of €937.8 million. We financed the acquisition of Vivacom through the issuance of the Existing 2026 SSNs, the Existing 2026 FRNs and additional Existing PIK Notes. Following approval by the European Commission in April 2020, the acquisition was consummated on July 31, 2020. Expansion in Bulgaria increased our addressable market by approximately 35% in terms of population, and the addition of Vivacom’s subscriber base more than doubled our existing subscriber base and included three million mobile subscribers, 541 thousand fixed-telephony subscribers, 472 thousand fixed broadband subscribers and 508 thousand fixed Pay-TV subscribers. Following the completion of the Vivacom Acquisition, we increased our commitments in respect of our Existing Revolving Credit Facility to €250 million. In September 2020, we completed the acquisition of a significant minority interest in Forthnet, a prominent telecom operator and Pay-TV provider in Greece for a cash consideration of €44 million. Forthnet provides ----- home entertainment and communications services to nearly 1.4 million RGUs. In November 2020, we acquired a controlling interest in Forthnet. Our acquisition of Forthnet marked our entry into the Greek market and is expected to strengthen our position as an industry leader in Southeastern Europe. In July 2020, we agreed to acquire the remaining 49% of Grand Production, and in addition, during the course of 2020, we acquired, or signed binding offers to acquire, stakes in several companies in Serbia and Slovenia for a total preliminary consideration of approximately €23 million. These transactions were completed in March 2021. In January 2021, we acquired Bulgaria’s largest multi-platform media company, Nova BG, from Advance Media Group EAD for a consideration of €290.6 million. Nova BG’s operations comprise 10 television channels, including NOVA TV which broadcasts throughout Bulgaria, Bulgaria’s largest online platform, Net Info, that reaches on average 80% of the Bulgarian population each month, and four radio stations. Nova BG had estimated last two quarters annualized revenue and adjusted EBITDA for March 31, 2021, of approximately €152 million and €57 million, respectively. In March 2021, we acquired Serbian newspaper Dan Graf (operating under the brand Danas) in order to increase our footprint in print and digital media in the Serbian market. Between April and June 2021, we signed agreements to acquire, or completed the acquisition of, the entire share capital or stakes in various other companies, including local internet and TV operators Net 1 EOOD and ComNet Sofia EAD, Digital Cable Television EOOD (N3), Serbian distribution company D Express, local internet and TV operators Networx-Bulgaria EOOD, TVN Distribution Bulgaria EOOD and Telco Infrastructures EOOD in Bulgaria, as well as Mainstream in Serbia. On July 9, 2021, we announced that we reached an agreement to acquire a majority interest of 54.31% in Croatian telecom operation Optima Telekom, based on an enterprise value of HRK 639 million. Optima Telekom offers a broad range of fixed broadband internet services to approximately 117 thousand subscribers and pay-TV services to approximately 57 thousand subscribers in Croatia. Completion of the Optima Telekom Acquisition is expected for the end of 2021 and is subject to customary conditions as well as the implementation of certain changes in the current Croatian telecommunication legislation relating to vertical integration between pay-TV broadcasters and distributors, and thus there can be no assurance that the acquisition will be completed by such expected date or at all. Once completed, the acquisition of Optima Telekom will allow us to further expand our presence in the Croatian market enabling Telemach Croatia to offer a full range of telecommunication services, including pay-TV, through its existing infrastructure. Optima Telekom had estimated last two quarters annualized revenue and adjusted EBITDA for March 31, 2021 of €60.1 million and €16.8 million, respectively. Following completion of the Optima Telekom Acquisition, we expect to be required to undertake a tender offer for the remaining shares of Optima Telekom not yet acquired. Acquisitions affect our results of operations in a variety of ways. Our results for the period during which an acquisition takes place are affected by the inclusion or exclusion of the results of the acquired or disposed of business in our consolidated results. In addition, the results of the acquired businesses after their acquisition may be impacted positively by synergies. Additionally, we may experience an increase in operating expenses, including staff cost, as we integrate the acquired business into our network. Acquisitions may also result in higher levels of depreciation and amortization expense. Also, because acquired entities are consolidated from the date of their acquisition and disposed of entities are no longer consolidated from the date of their disposition, the full impact of an acquisition or disposition is only reflected in our financial statements in the subsequent periods. As a result, the historical results of operations for the periods presented in this offering memorandum may not be comparable with each other.

Our business has grown substantially in terms of scale, geographic reach and service offering during the period under review through both organic growth and acquisitions. In addition, the corporate organization of our business has changed during this period as our business has grown and been integrated. As a consequence of these changes, our Group-level financial reporting has evolved during the last several years. In order to provide a meaningful analysis of our results of operations during the period under review, in addition to a discussion of our Group-level consolidated results of operations based on IFRS measures, we ----- also present a discussion of revenues, UG Adjusted EBITDA and UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure of our business segments for the three months ended March 31, 2021, the three months ended March 31, 2020 and the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020. Under IFRS 8 “Operating Segments,” we present our segment data in the notes to the Company Audited Financial Statements. In Note 7 to the 2020 Company Audited Financial Statements, we separately report segment results for nine business segments: - Serbia Group. This segment includes the results of cable services in Serbia and DTH operations in Serbia and North Macedonia, including the results of Ikom (acquired in April 2017). This segment also includes the results of Absolut Solutions, (although these results are not reflected in the statutory consolidated results of SBB Serbia); - Slovenia Group. This segment includes the results of our cable and mobile services and DTH operations in Slovenia; - Bosnia Group. This segment includes the results of our cable and DTH operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina; - Montenegro Group. This segment includes the results of our cable and DTH business in Montenegro; - Media Group.

This segment includes the results of Telemach Croatia from March 3, 2020; - Bulgaria Group. This segment includes the results of Vivacom from July 31, 2020; - Greece Group. This segment includes the results of Forthnet’s telecommunications operations from November 12, 2020; - Other segments. This includes our other operating business, Solford Trading Ltd.

Revenue reported under “Other” is mainly generated by Solford Trading Ltd. Our Media Group segment presents results for Nova BG (acquired on January 21, 2021) and Dan Graf (acquired on March 10, 2021) from the respective date of consolidation with the Group’s results for the three months ended March 31, 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure is prepared based on management accounts and not IFRS. Intragroup adjustments relate to unrealized profit on the intragroup sale of end-user equipment by SBB Serbia. When SBB Serbia sells this equipment to other Group companies in compliance with applicable transfer pricing requirements, it makes an unrealized profit on the sale. These unrealized profits are eliminated for the purposes of preparing our accounts in accordance with IFRS, but are not eliminated for the purpose of our management accounts. The application of IFRS 15 for acquisition costs in SBB Serbia reflects the additional effect of harmonizing our accounting policy with respect to the capitalization of subscriber acquisition costs for rebinding, upselling and cross-selling (which in the past were not eligible to be capitalized, but under IFRS 15 qualify for capitalization), which were determined subsequent to the preparation of our management accounts. Assets held for sale relate to programming rights acquired by Media Group for other Group Segments which were recognized under IFRS as intangible assets and were invoiced to other Group segments after March 31, 2021. Overflow between periods relates to the fact that our management accounts are closed prior to the closing of our accounts prepared in accordance with IFRS. Overflow between periods in any given period reflects the additional capital expenditure incurred between the preparation of our management accounts and our accounts prepared in accordance with IFRS for such period. ----- In this offering memorandum, we present UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure for the Company and for each of the Company’s business segments for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, and for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2021. See “Summary of Company and Group Run-Rate, Vivacom, _Unaudited Pro Forma and Certain Other Financial Data” and “Reconciliation of Certain Financial Data Presented Herein.” A reconciliation between the Company’s capital expenditure and UG Adjusted Capital_ Expenditure for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, and the three months ended March 31, 2021 is included elsewhere in this offering memorandum, under “Reconciliation of Certain Financial Data _Presented Herein.” In addition, for informational purposes only, we describe our anticipated UG Adjusted_ Capital Expenditure for the year ended December 31, 2021 based on management estimates, which may vary from our actual Group level capital expenditure data when it is prepared in accordance with IFRS. UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure and future UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure estimates are prepared based on management accounts rather than IFRS. One example of a difference in methodology used in preparing the management account financial data (as compared to IFRS financial data) is that when determining UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure relating to set-top boxes purchased by group companies, the expenditure is treated as inventory until such set-top box is activated by the end-user, at which time it is treated as a fixed asset. Under IFRS, however, this expenditure is required to be accounted for as a fixed asset from the moment such set-top box is purchased. As a result, when presenting our segment level UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure and our anticipated UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure for the periods presented in this offering memorandum, we classify our expenditures relating to set-top boxes as inventory until such set-top boxes are activated by the end-user.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

In all of our cable markets, cable Pay-TV is the basic service that a cable unique subscriber is typically required to subscribe to in order to receive the Group’s other services such as broadband internet access and telephony, with the exception of Bulgaria. A unique cable subscriber may subscribe to several different services, thereby accounting for only one unique cable subscriber, but several RGUs. DTH subscribers represent the number of individuals across the six Southeastern European markets (Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Montenegro and North Macedonia) who have subscribed to our DTH Pay-TV services. We believe that most of these subscribers are outside of our cable footprint. Typically, DTH subscribers are only able to subscribe to DTH based Pay-TV services and represent a single RGU. However, we are re selling ADSL services purchased from our competitors in the respective markets to DTH subscribers. Average monthly revenue per user, or ARPU, is a measure we use to evaluate how effectively we are realizing potential revenues from subscribers. ARPU is calculated by adding together, for each month in a given period, the total subscription related revenues for that particular month divided by the average number of subscribers for that month and then dividing that sum by the total number of months in the period. The following table sets forth certain of our key operating measures as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, and as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2021:",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

(2) Unique cable subscribers represent the number of individual end-users who have subscribed to one or more of our cable-based services. In all of our cable markets, cable Pay-TV is the basic service that a cable unique subscriber is typically required to subscribe to in order to receive the Group’s other services such as broadband internet access and telephony, with the exception of Bulgaria. A unique cable subscriber may subscribe to several different services, thereby accounting for only one unique cable subscriber, but several RGUs. (3) Cable Pay-TV RGUs includes (i) the sum of our analog and digital cable Pay-TV RGUs in Slovenia, (ii) our total analog cable Pay-TV RGUs (without separately counting analog cable RGUs that have purchased digital top ups) in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro and (iii) our analog and digital cable Pay-TV RGUs in Bulgaria. (4) OTT consists of our NetTV Plus and out of footprint EON subscribers. (5) Broadband internet RGUs represents residential broadband internet provided within our network footprint. (6) Fixed-line telephony RGUs represents residential fixed-line telephony provided within our network footprint. (7) Mobile RGUs represents mobile-telephony services provided to customers in Slovenia, where we have operated as an MNO since our acquisition of Tušmobil in April 2015. Following completion of the acquisition of Tele2 Croatia in March 2020, we also provide mobile-telephony services in Croatia, and following the completion of the acquisition of Vivacom in July 2020, we also provide mobile-telephony services in Bulgaria. (8) Other services include multichannel multipoint distribution service-based services, ADSL internet services and B2B services. (9) RGU Penetration represents for cable Pay-TV the number of unique cable subscribers at the end of the relevant period as a percentage of the number of homes passed by our network, and for broadband internet the number of RGUs at the end of the relevant period as a percentage of the number of unique cable subscribers. (10) Blended Cable ARPU is calculated by adding together, for each month in a given period, the total cable Pay-TV, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony revenues (including fixed-line telephony usage revenues and excluding minor installation fees) for that particular month divided by the average number of unique cable subscribers for that month and then dividing that sum by the total number of months in the period. Blended Cable ARPU does not include mobile ARPU, which was €10.9 for the year ended December 31, 2018, €10.8 for the year ended December 31, 2019, €9.5 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and €8.8 for the three months ended March 31, 2021. We calculate mobile ARPU by adding together, for each month in a given period, the total mobile-telephony revenues (excluding revenues generated by customers of other networks roaming on our network and excluding wholesale revenues) for that particular month divided by the average number of mobile RGUs for that month and then dividing that sum by the total number of months in the period. In addition, following the Vivacom Acquisition, we amended the definition of certain key operating measures (Homes Passed, Unique Cable Subscribers and Blended Cable ARPU) in order to align the calculation methodology across the Group. As a result, Bended Cable ARPU figures were restated for the periods starting from January 1, 2018 onwards. (11) As of January 1, 2019, we changed our reporting methodology in regards to certain key operating measures, which has resulted in immaterial differences as compared to previous periods. For the year ended December 31, 2018, OTT users on our network have been reclassified to Cable and Cable services users on other networks have been reclassified to Other Services from Cable.

(2) Homes passed represents all homes (households) ready to be connected directly to our fixed-line network. (3) Unique cable subscribers represent the number of individual end-users who have subscribed to one or more of our cable-based services. In all of our cable markets, cable Pay-TV is the basic service that a cable unique subscriber is typically required to subscribe to in order to receive the Group’s other services such as broadband internet access and telephony, with the exception of Bulgaria. A unique cable subscriber may subscribe to several different services, thereby accounting for only one unique cable subscriber, but several RGUs. (4) RGUs, or revenue generating units. Total RGUs are not equal to the total number of subscribers. For example, one subscriber who receives cable Pay-TV and telephony services over our network is counted as two RGUs, and our subscriber who receives cable Pay-TV, broadband internet and telephony services over our network is counted as three RGUs. (5) Mobile RGUs represents mobile-telephony services provided to customers in Slovenia, where we have operated as an MNO since our acquisition of Tušmobil in April 2015. Following completion of the acquisition of Tele2 Croatia in March 2020, we also provide mobile-telephony services in Croatia, and following completion of the acquisition of Vivacom in July 2020, we also provide mobile-telephony services in Bulgaria.

The total number of DTH Pay-TV RGUs amounted to 991 thousand as of March 31, 2021, a 121% increase year-on-year, primarily due to the acquisitions of Vivacom and Forthnet. As of March 31, 2021, we had 1,396 thousand broadband internet RGUs, representing an increase of 60%, compared to 871 thousand as of March 31, 2020. This is primarily attributable to the acquisition of Vivacom, an increase in multi-play subscriptions over this period and organic subscriber growth. The total number of fixed-telephony RGUs increased to 1,269 thousand as of March 31, 2021, an increase of 80% compared to 704 thousand as of March 31, 2020.

Our total RGUs increased by 122%, from 4,902 thousand as of March 31, 2020 to 10,890 thousand as of March 31, 2021. RGUs added over this period were mainly the result of the acquisition of Vivacom (4,461 thousand total RGUs) and Forthnet (1,375 thousand RGUs), as well as organic growth of cable Pay-TV and mobile services and a growing proportion of multi-play subscribers. _Group—Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019_ Homes passed increased by 1,834 thousand, or 99%, from 1,852 thousand as of December 31, 2019 to 3,686 thousand as of December 31, 2020, primarily due to the acquisition of Vivacom (1,750 thousand) and organic network expansion.

Our mobile service RGUs increased from 550 thousand as of December 31, 2019 to 4,483 thousand as of December 31, 2020. This is an increase of 3,933 thousand, or 715%, driven by the acquisition of Vivacom and Telemach Croatia (2,938 thousand and 937 thousand mobile RGUs, respectively) and organic growth in Slovenia. Our total RGUs increased by 178%, from 3,917 thousand as of December 31, 2019 to 10,897 thousand as of December 31, 2020. RGUs added over this period were mainly the result of the acquisitions of Vivacom (4,461 thousand RGUs), Telemach Croatia (937 thousand mobile RGUs) and Forthnet (1,375 thousand RGUs), as well as organic growth of cable Pay-TV and mobile services and a growing proportion of multiplay subscribers. _Group—Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018_ Homes passed increased by 19 thousand, or 1%, from 1,833 thousand as of December 31, 2018 to 1,852 thousand as of December 31, 2019, primarily due to organic network expansion.

The total number of DTH Pay-TV RGUs amounted to 446 thousand as of December 31, 2019, a 4% decrease as compared to 463 as of December 31, 2018, primarily due to increased competition, migration from DTH to our cable services (due to expansion of our network) and subscriber base cleaning. As of December 31, 2019, we had 856 thousand broadband internet RGUs, representing an increase of 4%, compared to 822 thousand at December 31, 2018. This is primarily attributable to an increase in multi-play subscriptions and organic subscriber growth. The total number of fixed-telephony RGUs increased to 695 thousand as of December 31, 2019, an increase of 8%, compared to 644 thousand as of December 31, 2018. This positive trend is primarily due to an increase in multi-play subscriptions and organic subscriber growth. Our fixed-line telephony RGUs as of December 31, 2018 have been restated by 17 thousand RGUs, from 661 thousand RGUs to 644 thousand RGUs, due to the ----- reclassification of fixed-line telephony RGUs outside our network footprint to Other services. This reclassification mainly involved Telemach Slovenia, affecting 14 thousand fixed-line telephony RGUs. Our OTT RGUs as of December 31, 2019 increased by 2% to 124 thousand, compared to 122 thousand as of December 31, 2018, primarily due to new content offered to customers. This figure includes 13 thousand OTT RGUs in Serbia and Slovenia. Our mobile service RGUs increased from 512 thousand as of December 31, 2018 to 550 thousand as of December 31, 2019.

(2) Our ARPU is presented in euro per month (excluding VAT) for the periods indicated. ARPU from broadband internet includes value added services subscriptions, including online backup, internet security and anti-virus services. (3) In August 2019, mobile interconnection revenues (€40 thousand) were reclassified as telephony interconnection revenues. (4) Blended Cable ARPU is calculated by adding together, for each month in a given period, the total cable Pay-TV, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony revenues (including fixed-line telephony usage revenues and excluding minor installation fees) for that particular month divided by the average number of unique cable subscribers for that month and then dividing that sum by the total number of months in the period. Blended Cable ARPU does not include mobile ARPU, which was €10.9 for the year ended December 31, 2018, €10.8 for the year ended December 31, 2019, €9.5 for the year ended December 31, 2020, €11.0 for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and €8.8 for the three months ended March 31, 2021. We calculate mobile ARPU by adding together, for each month in a given period, the total mobile-telephony revenues (excluding revenues generated by customers of other networks roaming on our network and excluding wholesale revenues) for that particular month divided by the average number of mobile RGUs for that month and then dividing that sum by the total number of months in the period. In addition, following the acquisition of Vivacom, we amended the definition of certain key operating measures (Homes Passed, Unique Cable Subscribers and Blended Cable ARPU) in order to align the calculation methodology across the Group. As a result, Bended Cable ARPU figures were restated for the periods starting from January 1, 2018 onwards. (5) The figures for Vivacom’s blended cable ARPU included in the table above are calculated in line with our methodology. Therefore, such amounts can differ from Vivacom’s standalone figures calculated as per their own methodology. _Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 Compared to the Three Months Ended March 31, 2020_ Slovenia segment._ Blended cable ARPU for Telemach Slovenia and mobile ARPU for the Slovenia segment remained stable for the three months ended March 31, 2021, at €35.4 and €10.9, respectively.

Serbia segment._ Blended cable ARPU for SBB Serbia in the three months ended March 31, 2021 amounted to €20.2. The 1% period on period decrease was primarily the result of the negative accounting impact of ----- IFRS 15. DTH ARPU for SBB Serbia decreased to €9.5 in the three months ended March 31, 2021, from €10.3 in the three months ended March 31, 2020, as the result of the same negative accounting impact from the implementation of IFRS 15.

DTH ARPU at Telemach of €1.5 million, Bosnia in the three months ended March 31, 2021 decreased to €8.7 million, compared to €10.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2020, as the negative accounting impact from the implementation of IFRS 15 offset the positive impact of a price increase in March 2020. Montenegro segment._ Blended cable ARPU for Telemach MNE in the three months ended March 31, 2021 increased by 1% period on period to €19.0, mainly as a result of growth in the number of subscribers for the multi-play offering. DTH ARPU at Telemach MNE decreased to €10.7 in the three months ended March 31, 2021, from €11.3 in the three months ended March 31, 2020, mainly due to the higher number of subscribers with expired discounts in the contract period as reported under IFRS 15.

This increase was due to higher mobile revenues as a result of an increased number of subscribers, price increases in March and October 2020, higher internet revenues (successful upselling and migration from legacy EON packages with higher internet ARPU) and higher mobile handset revenues. Serbia Group segment._ Revenue for our Serbia Group segment decreased by €689 thousand, or 1%, to €56,052 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from €56,741 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to the negative accounting impact from the implementation of IFRS 15 on video and internet services. Bosnia Group segment._ Revenue for our Bosnia Group segment decreased by €736 thousand, or 4%, to €18,052 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from €18,788 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to the negative accounting impact from the implementation of IFRS 15 on video and internet services of €989 thousand, partially offset by higher DTH video and internet subscription revenues. Montenegro Group segment._ Revenue for our Montenegro Group segment decreased by €171 thousand, or 5%, to €3,194 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from €3,365 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to a continued decline in the number DTH subscribers. Croatia Group segment._ Revenue for our Croatia Group segment was €43,770 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Tele2 Croatia was acquired and consolidated into United Group as of March 2020. _Bulgaria Group segment.

Total revenues of the Media Group segment (including intercompany revenues) increased by 36% year-on-year, to €84,646 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Other._ Revenue from our Other segment increased €4,024 thousand, or 88%, to €8,603 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from €4,579 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the launch of the Shoppster e-commerce platform during 2020. Other income._ Other income increased by €73 thousand, or 4%, to €1,796 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from €1,723 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2020. Content costs._ Content costs increased by €19,615 thousand, or 69%, to €48,166 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from €28,551 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the content costs of newly acquired channels. Link and interconnection costs._ Link and interconnection costs increased by €33,226 thousand, or 291%, to €44,660 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from €11,434 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of Vivacom, Forthnet and Tele2 Croatia. Cost of end-user equipment and other material costs._ Cost of end-user equipment and other material costs increased by €31,010 thousand, or 183%, to €47,974 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from €16,964 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to higher cost of sales for mobile handsets (mainly due to the acquisitions of Vivacom and Tele2 Croatia), the higher cost of end-user equipment, higher energy and fuel costs mainly as a result of acquisitions, as well as higher costs of goods sold (mainly relating to goods sold by Shoppster, which started operations in 2020). Staff cost._ Staff cost increased by €33,805 thousand, or 157%, to €55,342 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from €21,537 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This increase was mainly the result of the increase in staff cost due to the higher number of employees resulting from acquisitions in 2020 and 2021. ----- Media buying._ Media buying costs increased by €473 thousand, or 6%, to €8,417 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from €7,944 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This increase was mainly a result of the Nova Broadcasting Group Acquisition, which offset the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic (that is, which led to lower media buying volumes by Direct Media due to decreased overall advertising spend). Depreciation._ Depreciation increased by €30,448 thousand, or 112%, to €57,574 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from €27,126 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the addition of tangible assets as a result of the acquisitions in 2020 and 2021. Depreciation (right-of-use assets)._ Depreciation (rights of use assets) increased by €10,249 thousand, or 185%, to €15,799 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from €5,550 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This increase was due to the acquisitions completed in 2020 and 2021. Amortization of intangible assets._ Amortization of intangible assets increased by €43,893 thousand, or 197%, to €66,147 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from €22,254 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the addition of intangible assets through the acquisitions completed in 2020 and 2021. Other operating expenses._ Other operating expenses increased by €32,480 thousand, or 106%, to €63,110 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from €30,630 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2020. While all cost categories saw an increase, the largest increases were in maintenance, license fee and marketing and promotion costs. Net finance costs._ Net finance costs increased by €4,189 thousand, or 13%, to €37,562 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from €33,373 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to higher interest expense related to new bond issuances. Loss before tax._ Loss before tax decreased by €4,712 thousand, or 39%, to €7,233 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from €11,945 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This change was primarily due to increased operating profit, which partially offset the higher net finance costs. Income tax expense._ Income tax expense increased by €1,254 thousand, or 88%, to €2,687 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from €1,433 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2020. UG Adjusted EBITDA and UG Adjusted EBITDA Margin._ UG Adjusted EBITDA increased by €94,570 thousand, or 112%, to €179,164 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from €84,594 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the impact of the acquisitions of Tele2 Croatia, Vivacom and Forthnet, which were completed in March 2020, July 2020 and November 2020, respectively, as well as due to the organic growth of our subscriber base, price increases, continued successful cross-selling, migration of subscribers to multiplay packages and effective cost discipline. UG Adjusted EBITDA Margin decreased to 41% for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from 44% for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to the contribution of Telemach Croatia and Vivacom which had lower UG Adjusted EBITDA Margin as compared to our other segments, as well as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We discuss below UG Adjusted EBITDA by segment for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020. Slovenia Group segment._ UG Adjusted EBITDA increased by €1,284 thousand, or 6%, to €23,114 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from €21,830 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the organic growth of fixed and mobile RGUs, price increases in March 2020 (of mobile services) and October 2020 (of both mobile and fixed services) as well as the acquisition of 12 thousand unique video subscribers in the year ended December 31, 2020. Serbia Group segment._ UG Adjusted EBITDA decreased by €1,509 thousand, or 5%, to €31,041 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from €32,550 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to the negative accounting impact on our revenues from the implementation of IFRS 15. Bosnia Group segment._ UG Adjusted EBITDA increased by €645 thousand, or 10%, to €7,123 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from €6,478 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to lower programming costs resulting from the non-renewal of our contract ----- with Arenasport, which generated estimated cost savings of €1,299 thousand. This increase was partly offset by the negative accounting impact on our revenues from the implementation of IFRS 15. Montenegro Group segment._ UG Adjusted EBITDA increased by €73 thousand, or 10%, to €809 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from €736 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to 13 lower direct costs and lower operational costs, which more than offset the 5% decrease in revenues due to the negative accounting impact from the implementation of IFRS 15. Media Group segment._ UG Adjusted EBITDA increased by €6,567 thousand, or 36%, to €24,928 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from €18,361 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the integration of Nova BG in the Media Group segment, following its acquisition in February 2021, which was partially offset by a decrease in revenues due to the non-extension of certain carriage fee arrangements in Slovenia and Bosnia and increased costs relating to the enhancement of our content offering in those markets. Croatia Group segment._ UG Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was €15,089 thousand. Bulgaria Group segment._ UG Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was €61,488 thousand.

This increase was primarily due to an increase in internet revenues (a result of successful upselling and migration from legacy to EON packages with higher internet ARPU), higher mobile revenues as a result of an increased number of subscribers and price increases in March and October 2020 and higher mobile handset and other revenues (taking into account the effects of IFRS 15 and COVID-19-related government subsidies). Serbia Group segment._ Revenue for our Serbia Group segment increased by €3,698 thousand, or 2%, to €223,697 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €219,999 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to growth in the number of subscribers and and multiplay packages (particularly through successful cross-selling). Bosnia Group segment._ Revenue for our Bosnia Group segment decreased by €115 thousand, to €72,537 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €72,652 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to the accounting impact from the implementation of IFRS 15 (primarily in relation to video and internet services). Montenegro Group segment._ Revenue for our Montenegro Group segment decreased by €992 thousand, or 7%, to €13,307 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €14,299 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was mainly due to a lower number of DTH subscribers in 2020. Media Group segment._ External revenue for our Media Group decreased by €26,206 thousand, or 14%, to €158,886 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €185,092 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was due to the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily in the advertising and media selling businesses. Total revenues of the Media Group segment (including intercompany revenues) decreased by 5.3% year-on-year to €267,187 thousand in the year ended December 31, 2020. Other income._ Other income decreased by €1,508 thousand, or 17%, to €7,406 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €8,914 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019. Content costs._ Content costs increased by €6,321 thousand, or 5%, to €130,533 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €124,212 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the content costs of newly acquired channels. Link and interconnection costs._ Link and interconnection costs increased by €53,406 thousand, or 140%, to €91,557 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €38,151 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to higher mobile link and interconnection costs due to acquisitions in the period. Cost of end-user equipment and other material cost._ Material costs increased by €95,512 thousand, or 190%, to €145,781 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €50,269 thousand for the year ended ----- December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the higher cost of sales for mobile handsets (mainly due to the acquisitions of Vivacom and Tele2 Croatia), higher cost of goods sold (mainly in relation to goods sold by Shoppster, which started operations in 2020) and higher energy and fuel costs mainly as a result of acquisitions. Staff cost._ Staff cost increased by €32,712 thousand, or 32%, to €134,820 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €102,108 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the impact of additional staff costs from acquired companies. Staff costs in 2019 were impacted by a one-time non-charge of €21,659 thousand resulting from the application of IFRS 2 in relation to a long-term incentive scheme (LTIS). Media buying._ Media buying costs decreased by €1,513 thousand, or 4%, to €38,168 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €39,681 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to generally lower advertising expenditures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Depreciation._ Depreciation increased by €54,891 thousand, or 51%, to €161,719 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €106,828 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of new tangible assets as a result of the acquisitions of Vivacom, Forthnet and Tele2 Croatia. Depreciation (right-of-use assets)._ Depreciation (right-of-use assets) was €42,793 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to €17,972 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of €24,821, or 138%. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of Vivacom, Forthnet and Tele2 Croatia. _Amortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets increased by €60,998 thousand, or 74%,_ to €143,278 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €82,280 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the addition of intangible assets of acquired companies. Other operating expenses._ Other operating expenses increased by €79,819 thousand, or 67%, to €199,221 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €119,402 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to higher legal and advisory fees (including related to acquisition-related activities) and higher maintenance and license fee costs which mainly resulted from the acquisitions of Vivacom, Forthnet and Tele2 Croatia. Net finance costs._ Net finance costs increased by €28,736 thousand, or 28%, to €133,005 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €104,269 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to higher interest expense related to new bond issuances . Loss before tax._ Loss before tax increased by €11,914 thousand, or 23%, to €64,536 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €52,622 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to increased net finance costs, which more than offset the operating profit increase of €16,822 thousand. Income tax expense._ Income tax expense increased by €476 thousand, or 6%, to €7,890 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €7,414 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019. UG Adjusted EBITDA and UG Adjusted EBITDA Margin._ UG Adjusted EBITDA increased by €185,944 thousand, or 63%, to €481,338 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €295,394 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to an increase in revenues as a result of acquisitions completed in 2020, the organic growth of our subscribers, price increases, continued cross-selling as well as effective cost discipline. UG Adjusted EBITDA Margin increased to 41% for the year ended December 31, 2020, from 40% for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the impact of the Media Group segment which had lower UG Adjusted EBITDA Margin in 2019 as compared to 2018, largely as a result of Telemach Croatia and Vivacom which had lower UG Adjusted EBITDA Margin as compared to our other segments, as well as the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We discuss below UG Adjusted EBITDA by segment for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Slovenia Group segment._ UG Adjusted EBITDA increased by €15,295 thousand, or 21%, to €89,399 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €74,104 thousand for the year ended ----- December 31, 2019, primarily due to the organic growth of fixed and mobile RGUs and the price increase of mobile services in March and October 2020 and fixed services in October 2020. Serbia Group segment._ UG Adjusted EBITDA increased by €10,064 thousand, or 9%, to €127,007 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €116,943 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to higher revenues from the organic growth of our subscriber base through cross-selling and strict cost control, which was partially offset by increased programming costs. Bosnia Group segment._ UG Adjusted EBITDA decreased by €2,420 thousand, or 9%, to €23,993 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €26,413 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to higher programming costs resulting from the introduction of the new channel Nova BH, with an annual cost of €2,474 thousand and increased costs for our Sportklub channels. The increase in programming costs was partly offset by savings achieved on other operating expenses. Montenegro Group segment._ UG Adjusted EBITDA decreased by €487 thousand, or 15%, to €2,732 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €3,219 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to a 7% decrease in revenues, which was only partially offset by decreased costs and operating expenses. Media Group segment._ UG Adjusted EBITDA decreased by €2,255 thousand, or 3%, to €77,874 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €80,129 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the decrease in total revenues as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily in the advertising and media selling businesses.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

This increase was primarily due to organic growth, an increase in the number of subscribers for our multi-play offering (digital TV, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony), and price increases in April 2019. Montenegro Group segment._ Revenue for our Montenegro Group segment increased by €597 thousand, or 4%, to €14,299 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €13,702 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of multi-play subscribers. Media Group segment._ Revenue for our Media Group increased by €76,083 thousand, or 70%, to €185,092 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €109,009 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of multi-play subscribers and organic growth in both carriage fees and advertising, and the contribution from the acquisitions of Direct Media in September 2018 and Nova TV. Other income._ Other income decreased by €6,415 thousand, or 42%, to €8,914 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €15,329 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to the divestment of Totalna TV Croatia in the first quarter of 2018. Content costs._ Content costs increased by €20,938 thousand, or 20%, to €124,212 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €103,274 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to United Media’s acquisitions of TV channels (Nova TV in Croatia, Bosnia & Herzegovina and Montenegro) and increased sports rights costs. Satellite capacity costs._ With effect from January 1, 2019, satellite capacity costs are presented under depreciation and finance costs due to the adoption of IFRS 16. ----- Link and interconnection costs._ Link and interconnection costs decreased by €2,903 thousand, or 7%, to €38,151 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €41,054 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to lower mobile link and interconnection costs. Cost of end-user equipment and other material cost._ Material costs increased by €4,646 thousand, or 10%, to €50,269 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €45,623 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to the higher cost of sales for mobile handsets as a result of increased sales volumes and higher energy and fuel costs. Staff cost._ Staff cost increased by €3,097 thousand, or 3%, to €102,108 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €99,011 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to the impact of additional staff costs from acquired companies. Out of the total amount of staff cost in the year ended December 31, 2019, €21,659 thousand related to the non-cash impact of the application of IFRS 2 in relation to an LTIS and was the main driver of increased staff costs, as compared to €32,809 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018. On May 16, 2018, the shareholders of our former ultimate holding company, Adria LuxCo S.à r.l. entered into the LTIS for the benefit of certain members of our current and future management team. The LTIS consisted of a payment by the shareholders of Adria LuxCo S.à r.l. following completion of an initial public offering or a sale of the Group. The amount of the payment was calculated as a percentage of the proceeds received by the shareholders of Adria LuxCo S.à r.l. and is based on the accumulated return on investment achieved by such shareholders. In addition, the increase was due in part to our continued expansion, both organic and through acquisitions, of the Group during 2018. Media buying._ Media buying costs increased by €19,661 thousand, or 98%, to €39,681 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €20,020 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to the full-year effect of the acquisition of Direct Media in September 2018. Depreciation._ Depreciation increased by €7,186 thousand, or 7%, to €106,828 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €99,642 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to the expansion of our cable and mobile networks, increased investment in own produced content and new assets from acquisitions. Depreciation (right-of-use assets)._ Depreciation (right-of-use assets) was €17,972 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to nil for the year ended December 31, 2018. This was due to the result of the implementation of IFRS 16 on January 1, 2019. Amortization of intangible assets._ Amortization of intangible assets increased by €13,797 thousand, or 20%, to €82,280 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €68,483 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to increased investments in programming rights and own production, as well as the addition of intangible assets of acquired companies. Other operating expenses._ Other operating expenses decreased by €4,639 thousand, or 4%, to €119,402 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €124,041 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to the implementation of IFRS 16 and lower legal and advisory fees related to M&A activities. Net finance costs._ Net finance costs increased by €40,607 thousand, or 64%, to €104,269 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €63,662 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to higher interest expenses and costs of an early redemption option that was exercised in the January 2020. Loss before tax._ Loss before tax increased by €9,669 thousand, or 23%, to €52,622 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €42,953 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to increased finance costs. Income tax expense._ Income tax expense increased by €4,368 thousand, or 143%, to €7,414 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €3,046 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to a decrease in deferred tax as a consequence of the merger of SBB with IKOM and a higher level of income tax expense. UG Adjusted EBITDA and UG Adjusted EBITDA Margin._ UG Adjusted EBITDA increased by €34,768 thousand, or 13%, to €295,394 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €260,626 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to an increase in revenues as a result of the organic growth of our subscribers, price increases, continued cross-selling, effective ----- cost discipline, and the impact of acquisitions of Nova TV (Croatia, Bosnia and Montenegro) and media selling companies (Serbia) in the second half of 2018. UG Adjusted EBITDA Margin decreased to 40% for the year ended December 31, 2019, from 41% for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the impact of the Media Group segment which had lower UG Adjusted EBITDA Margin in 2019 as compared to 2018, largely as a result of acquisitions. We discuss below UG Adjusted EBITDA by segment for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Slovenia Group segment._ UG Adjusted EBITDA increased by €2,674 thousand, or 4%, to €74,104 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €71,430 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the organic growth of mobile RGUs and the price increase of mobile services in December 2018 and fixed services in February 2019. Serbia Group segment._ UG Adjusted EBITDA increased by €3,919 thousand, or 3%, to €116,943 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €113,024 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to higher revenues from the organic growth of our subscriber base and a price increase in January 2019, which was partially offset by increased programming costs and strict cost control. Bosnia Group segment._ UG Adjusted EBITDA increased by €2,982 thousand, or 13%, to €26,413 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €23,431 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a revenue increase driven by price increases for subscriptions for the Bosnia Group’s cable platform in April 2018 and April 2019 and satellite platform in January 2019, and an increase in the number of subscribers with higher priced subscriptions. Montenegro Group segment._ UG Adjusted EBITDA decreased by €107 thousand, or 3%, to €3,219 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €3,326 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to an increase in direct costs and operational expenses which offset the revenue increase resulting from the organic growth of the subscriber base and the increase in the number of multi-play subscribers. Media Group segment._ UG Adjusted EBITDA increased by €28,710 thousand, or 56%, to €80,129 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €51,419 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the contribution of the acquisitions of Nova TV (Croatia, Bosnia, and Montenegro) and media selling companies in Serbia in the second half of 2018, offset by organic growth in 2019 due to increased carriage revenues.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Therefore, UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure is primarily driven by extending, upgrading and maintaining our cable and mobile networks, the installation and in home wiring for new subscribers, the cost of cable modems, including highspeed modems for subscribers to our high-speed broadband internet, and the acquisition of content. UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure has also historically included certain investments of a non-recurring nature, as well as costs to integrate acquired businesses. UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure also includes increases in intangible assets (except our customer list and brand names) and does not include financial assets. As part of our strategy to focus on UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure improving returns, we implemented measures to ensure a more efficient usage of capital investment.

Vivacom as of March 31, 2021, had 2,961 million mobile subscribers, 573 thousand fixed-line telephony subscribers, 464 thousand fixed broadband subscribers and 489 thousand Pay-TV subscribers. Vivacom operates a well invested, fully owned and integrated fiber backbone network and has an extensive fiber to the home / fiber to the business network in Bulgaria.

The quality of Vivacom’s network, implementation of operational efficiencies and consolidation of services under one brand have led to high customer satisfaction and decreasing churn rates. Bulgaria is a relatively large, economically stable and mostly urban nation of seven million people and three million households. Bulgaria presents an attractive market, with rational and growing mobile markets, with a high and growing share of the market consisting mostly of post-paid mobile subscriptions, with increasing broadband penetration and migration to IPTV.

Although the general economic climate in Bulgaria has also seen negative effects, the Bulgarian ----- economy has historically demonstrated economic growth and fiscal stability with low levels of government debt. According to the BNSI, Bulgaria’s real GDP grew at an average rate of 3.3% each year between 2017 and 2019. Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 13, 2020 the Bulgarian parliament declared a state of emergency in Bulgaria and on March 23, 2020, it adopted certain measures and actions aimed at mitigating the negative consequences of the pandemic on citizens and businesses. Subsequently, similar extraordinary measures were introduced, some of which are still in effect since May 14, 2020. The Bulgarian Minister of Healthcare and the Bulgarian parliament adopted several social distancing and other restrictive measures, particularly with respect to access to restaurants, shopping centers and other commercial facilities, aimed at managing the spread of the pandemic, which have had a material adverse impact on the overall economy of Bulgaria. As of the date of this offering memorandum, even though the most restrictive social distancing measures were lifted and the Bulgarian government has implemented economic recovery measures while new infections have decreased, certain restrictions and social distancing measures remain in place, and additional restrictions could be reinstated at any time and at different levels as new variants of the virus spread. Such existing and potential measures may continue to adversely affect the overall economy of Bulgaria and could have a material adverse impact on Vivacom’s results of operations, in particular on its ARPUs and roaming revenues. However, these effects have been partially offset by the decrease in interconnect and roaming expenses. A potential prolonged recession and a deepening economic crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic could impact Vivacom’s growth prospects, customer spending and collection, and may result in assumptions and estimates that could trigger material adjustments to the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the future. Vivacom operates in the telecommunications sector, for which underlying customer demand has in the past been less cyclical than a number of other areas of consumer spending. However, the general macroeconomic environment could still have an adverse effect on consumer spending. In poor economic conditions, consumers are likely to delay the replacement of their existing mobile phones or may be more likely to disconnect or cancel their services. Generally, weak economic conditions may weigh on the growth prospects of the telecommunications market in Bulgaria, which in turn may negatively impact Vivacom’s number of subscribers and ARPU.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Many of the small-scale operators are considered to operate in the “grey market”as they do not pay taxes or license fees and use illegal aerial cables to deliver their fixed broadband services, which gives them an anticompetitive advantage, as they are able to offer lower priced fixed broadband products. If the enforcement of regulations against “grey market”operators increases, as Vivacom management expects, its penetration rate is expected to increase. Vivacom’s primary competitors have pursued aggressive marketing and pricing strategies to retain and expand their respective market shares which, if further pursued in the future, could reduce Vivacom’s margins, cause Vivacom to increase its marketing and promotional expenses in response to such strategies and result in increased customer churn. In addition, the competitive nature of the market in which Vivacom operates may be exacerbated by new market entrants or the consolidation of some of its primary competitors. Vivacom tries to avoid direct price competition and believes that its revenues and profitability will be supported by continued growth in the number of its subscribers, cross-selling and up selling of services, the launch of innovative new services and the active management of its subscriber acquisition, maintenance and retention costs.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Vivacom’s mobile revenue is principally driven by its average number of subscribers and ARPU. For the year ended December 31, 2020, revenue generated by Vivacom’s mobile segment comprised 63% of its total revenue. The Bulgarian mobile market is characterized by high penetration rates and high levels of competition. As a result, Vivacom’s mobile subscriber base depends on a number of factors, including pricing, quality of service, availability of new services, overall market growth, the level of competition to obtain new subscribers, retaining existing subscribers, its ability to cause existing subscribers to use their Vivacom SIM card as their primary SIM card (rather than as an alternate SIM card) and general economic conditions in Bulgaria. As a result of more customer favorable tariffs, including minutes to other operators and high data consumption limits, Vivacom believes that mobile subscribers will gradually cease using multiple SIM cards but rather choose one mobile operator. Mobile services ARPU is driven primarily by recurring charges from post-paid subscribers, traffic volume, data services utilization, revenue from interconnection rates and its prices. Vivacom’s prices, in turn, are mainly driven by the level of competition and the increasing demand for mobile data. Ultimately, Vivacom management believes that the increasing demand for mobile data is leading to increasing ARPU due to the higher contributions from data ARPU. _Fixed-line_ Vivacom’s fixed-line segment comprises its fixed voice services, fixed data services, fixed Pay-TV services and other fixed business, which includes its wholesale duct rental business. For the year ended December 31, 2020, revenue generated by Vivacom’s fixed-line segment comprised 36% of its total revenue. Fixed-Voice: Fixed-telephony and Other Vivacom’s fixed voice services include fixed-telephony and other fixed voice services. For the year ended December 31, 2020, revenues generated by Vivacom’s fixed voice services comprised 7% of its total revenue. Fixed-telephony subscriber levels depend on a number of factors, including pricing, the availability of new services and technologies, Vivacom’s ability to retain existing subscribers and win subscribers from competitors as well as general economic conditions in Bulgaria. Vivacom’s fixed-telephony subscriber numbers are gradually declining due to fixed-to-mobile substitution by customers and mobile operators’ fixedtelephony offerings, which undercut its prices and attract price sensitive customers. Wholesale traffic consists primarily of international transit traffic passing through Vivacom’s network to other national or international operators. Vivacom’s wholesale traffic business has low margins and is susceptible to volume volatility depending on the transit prices it sets, which transit prices change based on its wholesale interconnect expenses. ----- Fixed-Data: Fixed Broadband and Other Fixed data revenue, which includes revenue from fixed broadband and other data services is principally affected by the average number of subscribers and ARPU, which in turn depend on Vivacom’s prices and the speed and quality of connections that it is able to provide to its customers. For the year ended December 31, 2020, revenue generated by Vivacom’s fixed data services comprised 9% of its total revenue. Vivacom’s fixed data services comprises its fixed broadband services provided over ADSL, VDSL and FTTx connections to both residential and business customers and other data services, which include complex IP based data solutions for large business customers (including VPN and MAN services) as well as its “legacy” leased lines services that are mainly used by its security conscious business customers, such as financial institutions, who are looking for dedicated data capacity. If the enforcement of regulations against “grey market” operators increases as expected, the penetration rate of fixed data services is likely to grow. Additionally, subscribers are seeking higher broadband speeds and better connection quality, which are priced at a premium. Revenue from other fixed data services is generated from Vivacom’s professional internet, IP VPN and MAN services and complex corporate data solutions offered to business customers, as well as the sale of CPEs. The provision of additional services, nationwide offerings and quality backed service level agreements contribute to Vivacom’s ARPU. Fixed pay-TV Vivacom launched its DTH television service in 2010 and IPTV service in 2012, and is currently positioned as a fully integrated “quadruple play”operator offering nationwide coverage in Bulgaria. Vivacom’s DTH service delivers television content directly to its customers’ homes via satellite while its IPTV service is a fully digitalized platform delivering television content via Internet connectivity, which provides a variety of television channels, video on demand and a range of interactive features, including its over-the-top TV solution, TV GO. Vivacom’s Pay-TV revenue is principally driven by the number of subscribers and the services that they select. Vivacom offers a variety of services through both DTH and IPTV, including packages with over 240 channels that include more than 75 HD channels, exclusive content and other interactive services on its IPTV platform. For the year ended December 31, 2020, revenue generated by Vivacom’s fixed Pay-TV services comprised 10% of its total revenue. Fixed-Other Vivacom’s other fixed businesses are comprised of various services. For the year ended December 31, 2020, revenues generated by Vivacom’s other fixed business accounted for 11% of its total revenue. These include wholesale services to other licensed telecommunications operations, such as duct rental and collocation of equipment. Various digital and cloud services, including cloud IaaS, managed cloud VPS, shared web and e-mail hosting, SSL certificates, collocation, fleet management platform and others are also offered to business customers. Vivacom’s specific projects under the “VIVA Smart” brand, including smart city, Internet of Things (“IoT”), video surveillance, electronic education and other innovative solutions are also areas of potential expansion.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Vivacom’s mobile subscriber base consists primarily of residential subscribers and, in line with the Bulgarian mobile telecommunications market, the vast majority of its subscribers are post-paid subscribers. As of December 31, 2020, 88% of Vivacom’s total mobile subscriber base consisted of post-paid subscribers. All of Vivacom’s business subscribers are post-paid subscribers. Vivacom’s mobile subscriber base has decreased from 2,985 thousand subscribers as of December 31, 2019 to 2,954 thousand subscribers as of December 31, 2020. The decrease was mainly attributable to the post-paid subscriber base as a result of the ongoing SIM card consolidation trend in the mobile market. Blended mobile ARPU increased by 8% to BGN 13.5 for the year ended December 31, 2020, from BGN 12.5 for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to increased data usage as a result of growing demand for data. Blended mobile ARPU increased by 9% to BGN 12.5 for the year ended December 31, 2019, from BGN 11.4 for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to an increase in data usage as a result of growing smartphone penetration and strong demand for data. According to the CRC, the total number of subscribers in Bulgaria has declined by a CAGR of 2% between December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2019, to 8.1 million subscribers, corresponding to a mobile penetration rate of 117% as of December 31, 2019.

The decrease in fixed-telephony subscribers was primarily due to the strong price competition surrounding fixed-telephony services, where such services are being offered at a low price addition to Vivacom’s competitors’ mobile, fixed broadband and Pay-TV services. Vivacom’s total fixed-telephony subscribers decreased by 14% to 593 thousand as of December 31, 2019, from 689 thousand as of December 31, 2018. Both decreases in fixed-telephony subscribers were primarily due to strong price competition for fixed-telephony services, where such services are being offered as a low price addition to Vivacom’s competitors’ mobile, fixed broadband and Pay-TV services. Total fixed-telephony ARPU increased by 1% to BGN 10.2 for the year ended December 31, 2020, from BGN 10.1 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in total fixed-telephony ARPU was primarily due to increased take-up of more generous tariffs with higher monthly recurring charges. Total fixed-telephony ARPU increased by 2% to BGN 10.1 for the year ended December 31, 2019, from BGN 9.9 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in total fixed-telephony ARPU was primarily due to the introduction of more generous tariffs with included minutes by destinations. Fixed Broadband Vivacom’s fixed broadband subscribers increased by 3% to 475 thousand as of December 31, 2020, from 459 thousand as of December 31, 2019. This increase was mainly due to higher FTTx connections driven by growing demand for high-speed bandwidth capacity and reliable broadband service. Vivacom’s total fixed broadband subscribers increased by 3% to 459 thousand as of December 31, 2019, from 444 thousand as at December 31, 2018. This increase was mainly due to higher FTTx connections driven by growing demand for high-speed bandwidth capacity and reliable broadband service. Vivacom’s fixed broadband ARPU decreased by 0.1% to BGN 10.1 for the year ended December 31, 2020, from BGN 10.2 for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to bundling discounts and price competition from other alternative operators, which were partially offset by a growing share of tariffs with high bandwidth capacity. Vivacom’s total fixed broadband ARPU increased by 7% to BGN 10.2 for the year ended December 31, 2019, from BGN 9.5 for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to a growing share of tariffs with high bandwidth capacity, despite bundling discounts and price competition from alternative operators. Fixed Pay-TV Vivacom’s total fixed Pay-TV subscribers increased by 5% to 516 thousand as of December 31, 2020, from 490 thousand as of December 31, 2019. This increase was mainly due to the increased demand for high-quality services with superior user experience, rich content and HD channels. Vivacom’s total fixed Pay-TV subscribers also increased 5% to 490 thousand as of December 31, 2019, from 468 thousand as of December 31, 2018.

The increase was mainly attributable to the increase in fixed Pay-TV revenues due to a growing share of tariffs with higher monthly recurring fees and additional packages with rich content and sports channels, which was partially offset by strong price competition in fixed-telephony and bundling discounts and price competition from other alternative operators in fixed data. Vivacom’s mobile revenue was BGN 650.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of BGN 24.2 million, or 4%, from BGN 626.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Historically, Vivacom’s principal sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operating activities, which include revenues generated by its mobile and fixed-line subscribers, periodically as supplemented by borrowings under certain debt facilities. Vivacom’s ability to generate cash from operations will depend on its future operating performance, which in turn is dependent on various factors, including but not limited to those described under “—Key Factors _Affecting Results of Operations,”many of which are beyond its control. If Vivacom’s cash flow from operating_ activities is lower than expected, or its capital expenditure requirements exceed its projections, Vivacom may be required to seek additional financing, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. On July 31, 2020, United Group Bulgaria EOOD granted a related party loan to Vivacom with a maturity of ten years and bullet repayment at maturity. With the funds received under such related party loan, Vivacom pre-paid all liabilities under a senior debt facility that was due in 2023. As a result, Vivacom reduced its exposure to long-term third-party financings, which improved the ability to manage its liquidity requirements going forward. Vivacom believes that its operating cash flows and borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet requirements and commitments for the foreseeable future. Vivacom’s actual financing requirements will depend on numerous factors, including general economic conditions, the availability of credit from banks, other financial institutions and capital markets, Vivacom’s liquidity situation, restrictions in the instruments governing its debt, and its general financial performance, the future projects it could undertake and the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic could have on any of such factors. In particular, any prolonged economic crisis or ----- recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively impact customer spending and collections and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on Vivacom’s liquidity position. Vivacom maintains cash and cash equivalents to fund the day-to-day requirements of its business. Vivacom holds cash primarily in Bulgarian levs and euros.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Vivacom manages its foreign currency exchange rate risk related to future supplies denominated in USD by hedging the exposure through forward contracts. All forward contracts are entered into with credible counterparties. When a significant exposure to foreign currency arises, Vivacom takes into account the following factors: - future outlook on the volatility of financial market variables, which are modeled by Vivacom’s treasury department and are in accordance with best practice analytical techniques and economic models; - effect of the given foreign exchange exposure on Vivacom’s financial results; and - the cost of foreign exposure hedging. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Credit risk includes both the direct risk of default and the risk of a deterioration of creditworthiness, as well as concentration risks. Vivacom believes it has appropriate credit policies, procedures and authorization guidelines in place to manage and monitor credit risk. Vivacom’s credit risk is principally associated with trade and other receivables. Vivacom seeks to minimize credit risk through the application of monthly subscription contracts, initial credit checks, credit limits and credit monitoring procedures. Vivacom also seeks to minimize credit risk by obtaining cash deposits from its retail customers and distributors where it perceives credit risk to exist. Vivacom believes that its implementation of the foregoing procedures has led to experiencing a limited amount of credit losses. Expenses for receivables written off are recognized in other operating expenses in the profit or loss for a given period. For 2018, 2019 and 2020, BGN 174 thousand, BGN 195 thousand and BGN 102 thousand, respectively, of receivables were written off. In addition, Vivacom’s allowance for impairment of receivables in the statement of financial position as of December 31, 2018, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020 amounted to BGN 105,512 thousand, BGN 97,547 thousand and BGN 40,864 thousand, respectively for all trade and other receivables not written off, including CCB. Furthermore, as a general rule, Vivacom’s has no significant level of credit concentration related to accounts receivable. Credit risk relating to cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments, financial deposits and money market funds arises from the risk that the counterparty becomes insolvent and accordingly is unable to return the deposited funds or execute the obligations under the derivative transactions as a result of the insolvency. To mitigate this risk, wherever possible Vivacom conducts transactions and deposit funds with investment grade rated financial institutions and monitor and limit the concentration of its transactions with any single party. Additionally, due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, net impairment losses on financial and contract assets increased as a result of delays in customer payments during the second quarter of 2020, resulting respectively in higher expected credit losses rates and an increase in the allowance for impairment of trade and lease receivables measured by applying the IFRS 9 simplified approach. However, on a full-year basis, in the year ended December 31, 2020 both net impairment losses on financial and contract assets and the allowance for impairment of trade and lease receivables decreased compared to 2019. We believe that during the first quarter of 2021, Vivacom’s ability to collect receivables improved and as of March 31, 2021, it has returned to close to pre-COVID-19 levels.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

This arises mostly in connection with the contractual maturity of Vivacom’s monetary assets and liabilities that result from business activities and from the possibility that its trade debtors may not be able to settle their payment obligations within the normal terms of trade. Vivacom monitors its liquidity requirements and aims to mitigate liquidity risk through monitoring cash flows, ensuring the availability of overdraft facilities and preparing daily liquidity reports. Short and medium term cash flow forecasting is performed by its treasury department. These forecasts are monitored to ensure Vivacom’s cash and liquidity requirements are sufficient to meet operational needs and to monitor compliance with borrowing limits and debt covenants on its borrowing facilities.

Following a resurgence of COVID-19 infections in late ----- 2020, the government-imposed lockdown measures in November 2020. Infections decreased and certain measures were lifted but most remained in force until the end of January 2021. Vivacom’s operations were not restricted by the lockdown, and the impact on its financial position and performance remained in line with the disclosure in the Vivacom Audited Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. Any prolonged economic crisis or recession due to the COVID-19 pandemic could impact Vivacom’s growth prospects, customer spending and collection, and may result in assumptions and estimates that could trigger material adjustments to the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the future. In particular, management expects the assumptions and estimates used in determining impairment of Trade and other receivables, Contract assets, Property, plant and equipment, Intangible assets, Right-of-use assets and valuation of Investment property, and the related Deferred tax assets and liabilities to be affected. Management is not able to reliably estimate these impact as events are unfolding day by day. The COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on Mobile services revenue due to lower roaming revenue, primarily as a result of the COVID-19 related travel restrictions. This was partially offset by a decrease in interconnection and roaming expenses. Further impacts on service revenues are limited by the increased demand for telecom services during the periods in which the COVID-19 related restrictions were implemented. The longer term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also affect trading volumes, cash flows and profitability. The COVID-19 pandemic did not have an impact on the other critical accounting estimates and judgements disclosed in the Vivacom Audited Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2020. The discussion and analysis of Vivacom’s results of operations and financial condition are based on the Vivacom Audited Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 disclosed in Note 4 thereof, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to apply accounting methods and policies that are based on difficult or subjective judgments, estimates based on past experience and assumptions determined to be reasonable and realistic based on the related circumstances. The application of these estimates and assumptions affects the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. The resulting accounting estimates could differ from the related actual results. All assumptions, expectations and forecasts used as a basis for certain estimates within the Vivacom Audited Financial Statements represent good faith assessments of Vivacom’s future performance for which management believes there is a reasonable basis. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

Taking into account the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Vivacom has performed new impairment testing of its assets as of December 31, 2020 and no need for impairment was identified.

A provision is recognized when Vivacom has a present obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Contingent liabilities are not recognized because their existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within Vivacom’s control. Contingent liabilities are assessed continually to determine whether an outflow of resource embodying economic benefits has become probable.

Extension options (or periods after termination options) are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated). If there are significant penalties to terminate (or not extend), or any leasehold improvements are expected to have a significant remaining value, Vivacom is typically reasonably certain to extend (or not terminate). Other factors including historical lease durations and the costs and business disruption required to replace the leased asset are also considered. For lease contracts with indefinite term or short-term technical site rentals the Vivacom estimates the length of the contract to be equal to the economic useful life of non-current assets located in the leased property. To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Vivacom uses a buildup approach that starts with a risk free interest rate adjusted for credit risk for the country and the company and makes adjustments specific to the lease, e.g. term, currency and security. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

As a result of such reforms, Slovenia and Croatia were admitted to the European Union in 2004 and 2013, respectively. Bulgaria joined the European Union in 2007 and Greece in 1981 (and adopted the euro in 2001). Serbia officially applied for European Union membership in 2009, received full candidate status in 2012 and in January 2014, the first accession negotiations took place. Negotiations are ongoing with several Chapters having been opened up for discussion and review. Montenegro was granted candidate status in 2010 and the accession negotiations started in June 2012. North Macedonia has been a candidate for accession to the European Union since 2005, and in 2009 the European Commission recommended that accession negotiations be opened. Bosnia and Herzegovina formally applied for EU membership in February 2016 and in December 2016 and has received the accession questionnaire from the European Commission. The macroeconomic environment is improving in our four core countries (Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia and Slovenia). Real GDP growth in our four core countries is and will continue to be the key driver of private consumption and disposable income growth. Bulgaria’s economy has experienced a slightly negative growth for the period from 2018 to 2020, with real GDP decreasing by 0.2% from 2018 to 2020. However, real GDP per capita from 2018 to 2020 increased by 0.5%. Furthermore, in 2020, unemployment rate increased by 0.9 percentage points, driven by COVID-19. From 2018 to 2020, the unemployment decreased by 0.6 percentage points. In Greece, positive growth in disposable personal income is expected to continue, supported by expanding employment, wage growth and a stable inflow of worker remittances. Unemployment rate dropped by 0.8 percentage points in 2020. From 2018 to 2020, the unemployment decreased by 2.9 percentage points. ----- In Serbia, the growth in real GDP per capita is expected to continue, driven by monetary policy relaxation, structural reforms and supported by expanding employment. Unemployment rate dropped by 1.5 percentage points in 2020. From 2018 to 2020, the unemployment decreased by 3.8 percentage points. Growth is further driven by solid expansion in household spending as well as a trade surplus. Capacity utilization levels in industry and services have reached their highest level since 2007 and conditions for investment (e.g. high profits and low interest rates) remain favorable, which could potentially drive capital spending growth. Higher than expected employment and rising disposable income has led to healthy private consumption growth. Strong fiscal performance could support gradual reduction of public debt as a share of GDP. Eurozone membership allows the country to benefit from the credibility of the European Central Bank’s monetary policy and access to the Economic and Monetary Union’s highly developed capital markets. In Slovenia, the economy has been significantly hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, with real GDP and real GDP per capita decreasing by 6.1 percentage points. However, the country has experienced an increase in disposable personal income (+5.7% YoY in 2020). Unemployment rate increased by 0.5 percentage points in 2020, while from 2018 to 2020, the unemployment decreased by 0.1 percentage points.

The Serbian dinar depreciated against the Euro. Historically, Serbian consumer price index (“CPI”) inflation has tended to more than offset depreciation of the Serbian dinar against the Euro, leading to a constant “pass through” of the impact of the depreciation of the dinar to the consumer. We believe that our pricing strategy reflects the “pass through” principle outlined above.

Population density is a key factor for cable operators when deciding whether to invest in extending their existing cable network. A higher population density reduces the overall cost associated with the deployment, operation and maintenance of cable infrastructure and allows for mass marketing. Cable operators that operate in urban areas with high population density benefit from easier access to customers and more cost effective network upgrades and maintenance expenditures. As a result, cable networks in South Eastern Europe are mainly concentrated across metropolitan regions in Bulgaria, Serbia and Slovenia. As of December 2020, approximately 26% of households in Bulgaria, approximately 56% in Serbia and approximately 39% in Slovenia received their Pay-TV content via cable. The popularity of cable Pay-TV in Serbia is a result of the attractive content available on cable television, the high service quality and the capability to deliver interactive services such as VoD and CatchUp TV. - IPTV As a consequence of improvements in broadband internet technology, IPTV is increasingly being used for the distribution of television services and has traditionally been the second most commonly used distribution medium for television services across South Eastern Europe. In Slovenia, IPTV has recently become the most used distribution medium (56% of all households as of December 2020), supported by EU investment in shared open fiber networks, which are accessible to all operators for a fee. However, as these shared open fiber networks have been built with the objective of making high quality services available in rural parts of Slovenia, these networks have traditionally had a limited impact on our cable footprint, which typically covers urban and high population density areas. The principal providers of IPTV are Telekom Slovenije and T2 in Slovenia, Telekom Srbija (who regularly offers IPTV at a significant discount to attract subscribers) in Serbia and Bulsatcom in Bulgaria. ----- - DTH-TV DTH has traditionally been the third most commonly used distribution network medium for television services in South Eastern Europe region after cable and IPTV. Pay-TV content owners can penetrate rural areas more cost efficiently through DTH than through fixed line cable networks which are economically unviable to develop because of low population density in rural areas. Satellite operators, such as our own Total TV and competitors, such as Digi and Max TV, distribute digital signals via satellite directly to television viewers. To receive DTH, viewers need a satellite dish and a set top box. Depending on the service provider, viewers may also require a smart card for the subscription based and premium television services distributed via satellite. As of December 2020, approximately 46% of households in Bulgaria that had subscribed to Pay-TV services received their content via DTH, compared to approximately 16% in Serbia and approximately 5% in Slovenia. We believe that the majority of DTH Pay-TV subscribers live in rural areas without access to a cable network, which limits the overlap between our cable Pay-TV and DTH Pay-TV offerings. - OTT Another emerging technology is the delivery of television content “over-the-top” of an existing broadband internet network, which allows Pay-TV distributors to reach customers through the internet. We operate two of our own OTT content platforms: our regional OTT platform (which operates under the EON brand of products and services) and our international OTT platform, NetTV Plus. Our regional OTT platform offers customers of our broadband internet competitors within the region access to our full digital Pay-TV channel offering. As a result, EON subscribers can watch all of our digital Pay-TV channels on their TV screens, computers, tablets, mobiles or other internet enabled devices. Through NetTV Plus, we deliver extensive local and regional content, to the entire former Yugoslav expatriate community worldwide. Like EON, our subscribers can watch Net TV Plus directly on their TV screens, computers, tablets, mobiles or other internet enabled devices. We are a leading provider of Pay-TV services across our three core markets. We mainly compete with local incumbents in our three core markets (Telekom Slovenije in Slovenia, Telekom Srbija in Serbia and Bulsatcom in Bulgaria), as well as with other local players (T2 in Slovenia, Telekom Srpske, HT Eronet and A1 Bulgaria in Bulgaria, among others). We have managed to maintain our leadership and grow our market shares across our three core markets due to high quality content offering, excellent customer care, positive brand perception and better value and product propositions.

DSL technology leverages the fact that copper wires used in telephone networks have a much higher bandwidth (7 MHz) than that required for normal voice conversation (0 3.4 KHz). DSL utilizes the extra bandwidth to provide broadband internet connections. The most commonly used variant of DSL is ADSL which assumes that internet users normally receive or download significant more information than they would send or upload. Hence, ADSL connections normally have three to four times more bandwidth for downloading. However, as copper is a distance sensitive medium, access speeds for DSL technology decrease substantially as the distance from DSL hubs increases. The maximum download speed of DSL networks has to be shared between all services: television, broadband internet and telephony. Under currently available technology, DSL based multi-play providers can therefore not provide broadband internet and television services of comparable quality to those provided over cable networks. Another variant of DSL is VDSL, a DSL technology that provides a faster data transfer rate than ADSL technologies. It is an access technology that exploits the existing infrastructure of copper wires that were originally deployed for traditional telephone service as a way of delivering very high speed internet access. ----- Historically, DSL has been distribution platform and accounted for approximately 6% of all internet connections in Bulgaria, 37% in Serbia and 28% in Slovenia at the end of 2020. However, its market share has been consistently eroded by upgraded cable networks which offer higher quality service and higher speed as well as by the steady development of fiber based networks. - Cable Cable networks have been designed for the transmission of large amounts of analogue TV and radio signals and are able to deliver consistent speeds irrespective of the distance to the customer, unlike DSL. United Group companies are leading cable providers in the region with fully bi directional network, largely EuroDOCSIS 3.0 enabled and offering up to 220 Mbps download speeds, with the upgrade path up to 1.2 Gbps. Furthermore, the deployment of EuroDOCSIS 3.1 technology will allow cable operators to provide data download speeds as high as 10 Gbps and data upload speeds as high as 2 Gbps over existing hybrid fiber/coax (“HFC”) lines (with full duplex EuroDOCSIS 3.1, upstream capacity will also be as high as 10 Gbps). EuroDOCSIS 3.1 when deployed enables us to compete head on with fiber networks. In addition to faster download and upload speeds, EuroDOCSIS 3.1 also offers other tangible benefits, such as higher bandwidth capacity, better operational efficiencies, higher quality control, real time performance analysis and lower costs. All these other tangible benefits should be available without necessarily upgrading existing HFC networks or adding more fiber lines. EuroDOCSIS 3.1 is also backward compatible with Euro DOCSIS 3.0, which allows us to roll out the new specifications seamlessly, on an incremental basis. In 2020, cable distribution accounted for 14%, 50% and 30% of all broadband infrastructure in Bulgaria, Serbia and Slovenia, respectively. - FttH FttH is based on optical fiber cables and is the only infrastructure that offers similar speeds. Currently, FttH broadband internet connections play a very limited role in Serbia. FttH had a broadband market share in Slovenia of approximately 41% as of December 31, 2020, compared to approximately 35% in 2018. The main providers of FttH in Slovenia are Telekom Slovenije and T2. The increase in the FttH broadband market share is primarily due to extensive fiber roll out by Telekom Slovenije and T2 in 2009, as well as EU investment in municipally owned open fiber networks. As fiber roll out is more expensive than cable and the open fiber networks have traditionally been built with the objective of making high speed broadband internet and IPTV services accessible in rural areas, we believe that any competitive impact on cable operators will be limited, as these operators traditionally provide services in more urban and high density areas (i.e. no overlap). FttH is the technology of choice by United Group for greenfield expansion and new buildings in adjacent areas. - Other Broadband Internet We also compete with service providers that use other alternative technologies for broadband internet access, such as satellite technologies or mobile standards such as WiMax, universal mobile telecommunications system (“UMTS”) and high speed packet access (“HSPA”). These mobile broadband internet access technologies may allow both incumbent and new broadband internet access providers the ability to provide high speed connection services for voice, data, video and television. We estimate that only a small portion of households were using UMTS/HSPA for primary broadband internet access via laptops or PCs in 2014. We believe that the majority of mobile broadband internet users presently use mobile internet services to complement, rather than to replace, fixed line broadband internet. ----- _Competition_ We are the leading provider of broadband services within our footprint with 22%, 33% and 29% of the market share in Bulgaria, Serbia and Slovenia, respectively, as of 2020:",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Fixed broadband internet household penetration rates in Bulgaria grew from approximately 65% in 2018 to 72% in 2020, in Serbia from approximately 59% in 2018 to 66% in 2020 and in Slovenia from approximately 73% in 2018 to 75% in 2020. This translated into substantial growth in the number of subscribers at CAGRs of 5.3% (from 1,904 thousand to 2,113 thousand) in Bulgaria, 5.6% (from 1,447 thousand to 1,613 thousand) in Serbia and 2.2% (from 607 thousand to 634 thousand) in Slovenia during the same period. At the same time, fixed broadband penetration rates lag behind the penetration rates of more developed European markets, such as France, UK and the Netherlands. We believe that the positive growth in the broadband internet market in our three core markets also stems from the overall increasing importance of the internet as the primary communication medium of choice as well as from a decrease in end user equipment costs, leading to increasing usage of personal computers and smartphones. By 2024, broadband internet penetration rates are expected to reach 82%, or 2,351 thousand, of households in Bulgaria, 73%, or 1,765 thousand, of households in Serbia and 84%, or 722 thousand, of households in Slovenia. As data consumption demand grows in households, the penetration rate of high speed broadband (lines capable of providing at least 30 Mbps) is expected to increase rapidly in Slovenia and Serbia in the coming years. The Serbian “Strategy for the Development of Broadband and Networks and Service,” adopted in 2014, established a target of 100% coverage with 30 Mbps by 2020 and 50% coverage for 100 Mpbs in an effort to align with EU targets. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

MTR asymmetry in the Slovenian market was eliminated as of January 1, 2013, when MTR for all operators became €0.0324 per minute. In July 2014, the Slovenian regulator, AKOS, announced a significant reduction in MTRs to €0.0114 per minute and implemented this rate for all Slovenian operators with effect from September 1, 2014. Following this reduction, Slovenian MTR was brought closer in line with the target EU benchmark of €0.01 per minute, indicating limited further downside. _Licenses_ - Spectrum Licenses The first ever spectrum auction in Slovenia was completed in April 2014 with the award of several frequency bands to three mobile operators: Telekom Slovenije, Si.mobil (now A1) and Tušmobil (Telemach Slovenia). Three of the four MNOs (T 2 did not participate) acquired the following bands: A1 acquired total of 90 MHz on paired 800, 900, 1800 and 2600 MHz and a total of 45 MHz on unpaired 2100 and 2600 MHz; Telekom Slovenije acquired a total of 85 MHz on paired 800, 900, 1800 MHz and a total of 25 MHz on unpaired 2600 MHz band, Telemach Slovenia acquired a paired spectrum of 5 MHz on 900, 10 MHz on 1800 as well as 10 ----- MHz in the 800 MHz band which is widely recognized as the most efficient band for 4G LTE roll out. The licenses were awarded for a long term tenure of 15 years which we believe represents a significant barrier to entry for a potential fifth MNO. In July 2016, AKOS announced its decision to conduct an auction for various mobile spectrum bands in Slovenia that remained unallocated. These included frequencies in the 1800 MHz band and the 2100 MHz band. AKOS set the reserve price at €2.6 million for each block of 2x5 MHz in the 1800 MHz frequency band, two blocks of which were available for auction, and €1.3 million for the block of 2x5MHz in the 2100 MHz band, one block of which was available for auction. On August 5, 2016, we submitted our tender for these frequencies. On August 29, 2016, AKOS issued a decision in our favor on the allocation of two blocks of 2x5 MHz in the 1800 MHz frequency band and one block of 2x5 MHz in the 2100 MHz frequency band for an aggregate amount of €6.6 million. Telemach Slovenia’s license for the frequencies in the 1800 MHz band is valid through January 2031, and for the frequencies in the 2100 MHz band is valid through September 2021. Telemach Slovenia currently possesses 60% less spectrum compared to its main two competitors. In April 2021, we secured 15-year spectrum licenses in Slovenia for 5G frequencies, and commenced deployment and commercial launch of 5G 3600 MHz in Slovenia in June 2021. We believe additional frequencies will be needed to be able to address our growing mobile business, especially in the domain of mobile broadband. On September 2020, we announced the commercial launch of our 5G network in Bulgaria and, to that end, in May 2021, we secured a 20-year license for 100 MHz spectrum frequencies in the 3.6 GHz band. _Competition_ Telekom Slovenije is the largest mobile operator in the market, with a market share of 40% as of December 31, 2020. Telemach Slovenia had a market share of 24% as of December 31, 2020. The mobile markets in Bulgaria and Serbia are led by incumbents as well as mobile players that are part of international groups.

As of December 31, 2018, SBB Serbia and Telemach BH had bundle penetration of 80% and 74% respectively. While such convergence has occurred at a relatively fast pace in a number of Western and Eastern European markets, notably in Slovenia, a series of regulations, including those limiting alternative operators other than the incumbent service providers from providing telephony services in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, have historically prevented such convergence to occur in our three core markets. However, the relatively recent liberalization of the Serbian and Bosnian fixed line telephony markets is accelerating the convergence in our three core markets.

In Serbia, we believe that cable overbuild is relatively low and largely concentrated in Belgrade. The Serbian cable market remains relatively fragmented and we believe that due to our scale in the market as well as our acquisition history, we are well positioned to continue consolidating the Serbian cable market and thereby increasing our overall market share. Similar to Serbia, cable overbuild is relatively low in Bosnia and Herzegovina (mainly in the Sarajevo region) and our primary competitors are the incumbents in the ethnic regions in which we operate, BH Telecom, Telekom Srpske and HT Eronet, as well as regional cable operators, who all offer multi-play bundles at discounted prices. However, we believe we have a competitive advantage due to our attractive content offering and high broadband internet speed. The Bosnian cable market remains relatively fragmented and we also believe that we are well positioned in the market to continue consolidating the Bosnian cable market and thereby increasing our overall market share.

We offer attractive VoIP packages in Slovenia which include free calls to all fixed phone subscribers within our network, including to Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. We believe this offering is particularly attractive because a number of Slovenian residents have family in Serbia or Bosnia and Herzegovina who they can reach at no additional charge through our packages. Since late 2012, we have become the second largest provider of fixed line telephone services in Serbia, behind the incumbent Telekom Srbija. Moreover, largely due to the introduction of full telephone number portability in April 2014, we have significantly increased the number of our fixed line telephony subscribers in Serbia. We expect this trend to continue. Similarly, in Bosnia and Herzegovina we offer VoIP telephony services as part of our cable and television bundle. Residential Segment (Mobile) _Slovenian Mobile Market Overview_ Following our acquisition of Tušmobil in April 2015, we provide mobile telephony services in Slovenia as an MNO. There were approximately 2.5 million mobile subscribers in Slovenia as of December 31, 2018, which resulted in a penetration rate of 119%, below the average mobile penetration rate in Europe. The number of mobile subscribers in Slovenia grew at a CAGR of approximately 1.5% between 2014 and 2018. We believe mobile penetration in Slovenia is still below the penetration benchmarks provided by certain developed mobile markets in Western Europe, such as Germany and Sweden, supporting continued subscriber growth potential in the market.

VoIP technologies place and transmit telephone calls over the internet instead of using the traditional PSTN. Following the liberalization of fixed line telephony markets in Serbia, all telephony markets in our three core markets are now fully liberalized, providing us with significant growth opportunities. Slovenia is one of the few European telephony markets in which VoIP technology accounts for the majority of the fixed line telephony connections. We believe that this increase in VoIP market share was primarily driven by lower prices of VoIP connections compared to PSTN connections which are often offered as part of a competitively priced cable or FttH internet and television bundle. _Competition_ Historically, the respective incumbent (Telekom Slovenije in Slovenia, Telekom Srbija in Serbia) in two of our three core markets, has been the largest provider of fixed line telephony in each respective market. However, following the liberalization of the region’s telephony markets and the introduction of VoIP technologies, which allows customers to make traditional fixed line telephone calls using a standard telephone handset and provides comparable quality to PSTN at lower prices, the respective Bulgarian, Serbian and Slovenian incumbents have generally lost market share to us:",N/A,as_expected,2021,933
382_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1129,INDUSTRY AND MARKET OVERVIEW,1129.15,Media Overview,1129.15.1,Broadcasting,"_Overview and Technology_ Television in Slovenia was first introduced in 1958, with the launch of JRT RTV Ljubljana (now RTV Slovenija) as the first TV station. Following the independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, the Mass Media Act which was passed in 1994, laid out the specific model for the privatization of media in Slovenia. The Mass Media Act was revised in 2001 and 2006 to define clear rules for ensuring media pluralism. Today, TV market in Slovenia is operated by both state owned and for profit corporations and is mainly shared between public ----- service RTV Slovenia and private stations Kanal A and Pop TV. Kanal A was the first commercial TV station which launched in 1991, followed by Pop TV which launched in 1995. Television in Serbia was first introduced in 1958 with state owned Television Belgrade, now known as Radio Television of Serbia (“RTS”). The Serbian broadcasting system evolved from a public monopoly into a dual system of public and private stations. The switch over from analogue to digital terrestrial television in the country was completed in 2015. Television in Bosnia and Herzegovina was first introduced in 1956 and since then, it has now developed into a market with both private and public channels. Three public TV stations (BHT1, FTV and RTRS) are operating within the Public Service Broadcasting system and are financed from radio and television fees. Together with private stations, as well as regional public stations, they form the national TV market. The Pay-TV market is significantly fragmented with the majority of private TV stations being locally focused. However, there are a number of players that aim to capture a wider audience throughout the country (for example, N1 of Telemach BH). The process of TV digitalization is still ongoing in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Television in Croatia was first introduced in 1956 with Television Zagreb. Today there are four channels with nationwide coverage. Digital video broadcasting terrestrial signal broadcasting was introduced in 2002, with the full digital switchover being completed by 2010 via gradual ceasing of analogue TV throughout the country.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933
382_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1129,INDUSTRY AND MARKET OVERVIEW,1129.15,Media Overview,1129.15.2,Advertising,"Across our three core markets, television is the medium of choice for advertising, accounting for approximately 50% of total advertising spent. The internet, as a medium of choice for advertising, is expected to grow at higher rates than television, but will still remain below television in coming years. The average daily viewing time across the three core markets ranges from approximately 3.5 to 5.5 hours demonstrating the importance of TV as medium for information and entertainment. Most importantly, the demand for TV is relatively inelastic. TV continues to offer a unique proposition to advertisers: enormous scale, fast reach, very high quality advertisement inventory and an attractive contextual environment for brand building. As a result, TV advertising should continue to be resilient, with any gradual volume reductions more than offset by price inflation. Television broadcasting in each of our markets is regulated by a governmental authority or agency. For example, privately owned broadcasters in Slovenia are allowed to broadcast advertising for up to 12 minutes in any hour, whereas the public broadcaster, Radiotelevizija Slovenija, is allowed to broadcast advertising for up to 10 minutes per hour given the additional financing from TV licensing fees. Between the hours of 6:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m., the advertising time limit is reduced to seven minutes for the public broadcaster. In Serbia, advertising time is regulated on an hourly and daily basis, where commercial broadcasters are restricted to 20% of the daily broadcasts and to 20% per hour of broadcasting. Similarly to Slovenia, in Croatia the permitted advertising time per hour is 12 minutes with no daily limit and direct sales advertising must be at least 15 minutes. The advertising markets in South Eastern Europe have benefitted from robust macro-economic conditions. Advertising spend in our core three countries (Slovenia, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina) is expected to grow faster than real GDP, with TV channel advertising remaining resilient. The recent decline of advertising spend in Croatia resulted from bankruptcy of one of Croatia’s biggest company, Agrokor, which employed approximately 60 thousand total staff members and its revenues accounted for more than 15% of Croatia’s total GDP. The Direct Media/Pink Acquisition, completed in September 2018, focuses on targeted advertising and specialized Pay-TV and positions us at the forefront of digital advertising in the region. As a result, we acquired the know-how of more than 100 of the best professionals in the region who provide significant synergies with the broader operations of the Group. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

As of March 31, 2021, we provided services to approximately 10.9 million RGUs and analog and digital cable Pay-TV services to approximately 1.9 million unique subscribers. United Group’s revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was €439.4 million and UG Adjusted EBITDA was €179.2 million. The Group had Run-Rate Revenue for the annualized last two quarters ended March 31, 2021 of €1,916.4 million and Run-Rate Last Two Quarter Annualized Adjusted EBITDA for March 31, 2021 was €706.3 million. The Combined Group is the clear multi-play leader in its footprint, with market leading positions in Pay-TV, broadband internet and fixed-line and mobile-telephony in Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Bulgaria, Croatia and, following the Forthnet Acquisition, Greece. The Combined Group’s addressable market comprised 13.4 million households as of December 31, 2020. We have grown rapidly through both acquisitions and organic growth. In July 2020, we acquired Vivacom, the market leading integrated telecommunications operator in Bulgaria, based on total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, which is the leading operator in fixed-line telephony services and broadband services, the number three provider of mobile-telephony services and the number three provider of Pay-TV, in each case, by number of subscribers as of March 31, 2021. The Vivacom Acquisition increased our addressable market by approximately 35% in terms of population, and the addition of Vivacom’s subscriber base more than doubled our existing subscriber base. In March 2020, we also acquired Tele2 Croatia, the third largest telecommunications operator in Croatia, based on mobile revenues as of March 31, 2021, through which we offer mobile services in Croatia. In November 2020, we completed the acquisition of a controlling interest in Forthnet S.A., a prominent telecom operator and Pay-TV provider in Greece, which marked our entry into the Greek market and will strengthen our position as an industry leader in Southeastern Europe. In January 2021, we acquired Bulgaria’s largest multi-platform media company, Nova Broadcasting Group EOOD, from Advance Media Group EAD, providing a strong base for our content offering in Bulgaria. In July 2021, we signed an agreement to acquire a majority interest in Optima Telekom, a Croatian telecom operator offering a broad range of fixed internet and pay-TV services. Subject to its completion, the Optima Telekom Acquisition will allow us to further expand our presence in the Croatian market and offer a full range of telecommunication services, including pay-TV, through our existing infrastructure in the country. We offer a diverse and differentiated line of products and services. We are the leading distributor of satellite (“DTH”) Pay-TV across Southeastern Europe, with Pay-TV product and service offerings in each of Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia and Montenegro, where we use our Total TV platform to serve subscribers both inside and outside of our cable footprint to deliver content across the entire region, including rural areas. Following the Vivacom Acquisition, we also provide Pay-TV services in Bulgaria and are the leading IPTV provider in Bulgaria, while the Nova Broadcasting Group Acquisition strengthened our content offering in Bulgaria. Following the Forthnet Acquisition, we also provide cable and DTH services in Greece. In addition to our cable-based and satellite-based services, we offer mobile-telephony services in Slovenia, Bulgaria and Croatia. We provide 4G LTE coverage to almost the entire population in each of these countries, and we are rolling out 5G networks across our mobile-telephony footprint. On September 21, 2020, we announced the commercial launch of our 5G network in Bulgaria, and to that end in May 2021, we secured a 20-year license for 100 MHz spectrum frequencies in the 3.6 GHz band. We also in April 2021 secured 15-year spectrum licenses in Slovenia for 5G frequencies, and commenced deployment and commercial launch of 5G 3600 MHz in Slovenia in June 2021. We are participating in a 5G spectrum auction in Croatia this year. Our core telecommunications business is also complemented by our two OTT distribution platforms that customers can access through internet based streaming: EON, our regional OTT platform, which enables customers connected to our competitors’ broadband internet connections outside of our cable footprint to access our attractive portfolio of Pay-TV channels, and NetTV Plus, our international OTT platform, which delivers ethnic and local language content to the ex-Yugoslav diaspora around the world. In July 2020, we launched Shoppster, our regional e-commerce online-shopping platform, which offers more than 20 popular product categories, including electronics, home and gardening, tools, fashion, items for children and kitchen appliances. Shoppster is available as an integrated online and TV shopping platform in Serbia and Slovenia. ----- Through our in-house content business, we produce distinctive and attractive in-house media content for our Pay-TV channels across multiple key genres that have historically driven Pay-TV subscriptions. These channels include Southeastern Europe’s most popular family of branded Pay-TV sports channels, as well as popular movie channels, children’s channels, a 24/7 news channel, music channels and other specialized channels, which we continue to expand both organically and through acquisitions. We currently produce over 40% of the total content in our national (terrestrial) and cable operations, and our programs typically receive ratings of between 30% to 60% in the markets in which they are available. The Group also has in-house media and content production in Greece. We believe that our market leading content portfolio differentiates us from our competitors, has enabled strong growth in our business and provides us with predictable third-party carriage fees. As part of our media business, we also provide advertising services and digital production and distribution. Our Nova TV Croatia channel has strong local content production and profitability, with an audience share of 40% and market share by advertising revenue of 50%. Nova BH and Nova M have appealing content, such as popular national team football events until 2022, such as the Euro Cup qualifiers, Euro Cup, World Cup qualifiers and League of Nations. In March 2019, we launched Nova S in Serbia. Nova S is a channel offering high-quality local production series, sports, talk shows with well-known national presenters and high-quality international productions, fully exclusive to SBB, Total TV and EON. The Nova Broadcasting Group Acquisition makes us a major content player in Bulgaria by adding Nova BG’s media platform comprising ten television channels, including NOVA TV, which broadcasts throughout Bulgaria, Bulgaria’s largest online platform, Net Info, which reaches on average 80% of the Bulgarian population each month, and four radio stations. In addition to our own content, as a result of our pan regional presence and well established distribution network, we are a distribution partner of choice for premium regional and international content owners, such as Discovery/Eurosport, Viacom, AXN, CNN, HBO, Fox and Universal, and sports rights owners, such as the English Premier League, Spanish Football League LaLiga, 2020 UEFA European Championship qualifiers, 2020 UEFA European Championship, 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, UEFA League of Nations, ATP, Formula 1, Euroleague, and Moto GP, which we believe allows us to consistently obtain high-quality content and attractive payment terms. Nova BG holds licenses to offer compelling content in Bulgaria through distributors such as CBS Intenrational, the Walt Disney Company, Columbia Pictures and Paramount Pictures, as well as popular sports content such as the English Premier League football, Euro Cup qualifiers and the Euro Cup and Formula One racing. We believe these providers partner with us because of our well-known brands, large network and our focus on Southeastern Europe. We operate most of our business across eight countries in Southeastern Europe: Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Greece. These countries have a combined population of approximately 40 million, distributed across approximately 13.4 million households as of December 31, 2020, and represent the second-largest CEE market after Poland. Despite economic differences, many of these countries share a joint history and form a single market in which small local differences are overshadowed by the influence of similarities in cultural preferences and language across the region and are characterized by growing Pay-TV and broadband markets that are currently underpenetrated relative to some other CEE and Western European markets. We are the leading multi-play provider in Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Bulgaria, where we combine our services into packages, or bundles, which offer subscribers the convenience of being able to purchase television, broadband internet and telephony services from a single provider, and provides us with significant opportunities to cross-sell our products. We believe that we are well-positioned to maintain our market leading positions in the Pay-TV and cable broadband internet markets in Slovenia, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to further increase our market shares, as we differentiate our product offerings through one of the highest download speeds in our broadband markets, access to desirable media content, a well invested network and high-quality customer service, which has led to relatively low churn rates which we believe demonstrate customer loyalty. We also believe that we are well-positioned to continue to grow in our region, and build on our expansion into Bulgaria and Greece. Our customers view the telecommunications products and services that we offer as part of their everyday lives, which results in recurring, high demand for our products and makes our business more resilient to macro-economic disruptions when compared to other discretionary products and services. For example, during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic our products and services have been instrumental in providing connectivity and entertainment, as an increasing number of people began to work or study remotely and spent significant amounts of time at home, which resulted in a significant increase in our voice and data traffic between March and May 2020. In particular, over this period, our fixed data traffic increased at rates ----- between 50% and 70%, while fixed voice traffic increased at rates between 50% and 85%, depending on the country. In addition, our mobile data and voice traffic increased at rates between 30% and 40%, depending on the country. Traffic levels decreased during the summer months and started increasing again as new lockdowns were implemented in various countries. To accommodate such higher customer demand, we increased capacity on network elements and interconnections. In this recurring, high demand environment, we believe we offer superior products, faster broadband speeds and higher quality content than many of our competitors.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

The acquisitions we have made have delivered significant geographic expansion and diversification of our business into Bulgaria and Greece. The Vivacom Acquisition, for example, increased our addressable market by 35% in terms of population, and doubled our existing customer base. Furthermore, our scale and presence across Southeastern Europe and across our product portfolios allows us to cross-sell our services and expand the number of multi-play packages we provide, creating opportunities to expand our customer base.

See “Risk _Factors—Risks Related to the New Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—Each Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.” and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.” For a description of the Existing Intercreditor Agreement, see_ “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Existing Intercreditor Agreement.” The Security Documents will be governed by the laws of the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Bulgaria. The Liens on the Collateral, and the ability of the Security Agent to realize upon the Collateral, will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to ----- fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations, see “Limitations on _Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.” In addition, the enforcement of the_ Collateral will be limited to the maximum amount required under the Agreed Security Principles to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. As a result of these limitations, the enforceable amount of the SSN Issuer’s obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and a SSN Guarantor’s obligation under its SSN Guarantee could be significantly less than the total amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, or a SSN Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under the SSN Guarantee. See “Risk _Factors—Risks Related to the New Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—Each Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.”_ Subject to the terms of the Security Documents, the SSN Issuer, the SSN Guarantors and any other Collateral provider will have the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes (other than as set forth in the Security Documents), to freely operate the Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom. Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain _Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the pledgors_ of the Collateral will be permitted to pledge the Collateral in connection with future issuances of Indebtedness of the Company or the Restricted Subsidiaries, including any Additional Senior Secured Notes, not prohibited by the SSN Indenture. No appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the SSN Issuer in connection with the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes. There can be no assurance that the proceeds from the sale of the Collateral, in whole or in part, pursuant to the SSN Indenture and the Security Documents following an Event of Default, would be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders and the obligations owed under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Existing Senior Secured Notes, any Operating Facilities and any Hedging Obligations. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period of time or at all. In addition, the Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances, including the issuance of Additional Senior Secured Notes and the disposition of assets comprising the Collateral, subject to the terms of the SSN Indenture. Please see the section entitled “Risk _Factors—Risks Related to the New Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The New Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that has been granted as security for such Notes and future secured indebtedness may be secured by certain assets that do not secure such Notes; in the event that the Collateral is enforced, the lenders under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, counterparties of certain hedging obligations and creditors for other super priority indebtedness will be paid with the proceeds from the enforcement of Collateral in priority to the holders of the New Notes.”_ In addition, the Existing Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will place limitations on the ability of the Security Agent to cause the sale of some or all of the Collateral. These limitations may include requirements that some or all of the Collateral be disposed of only pursuant to public auctions or only at a price confirmed by a valuation in certain circumstances. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements— _Existing Intercreditor Agreement.”_ The Trustee for the Senior Secured Notes has, and by accepting a Senior Secured Note, each Holder will be deemed to have: - irrevocably appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent under the Existing Intercreditor Agreement and the other relevant documents to which it is a party (including, without limitation, the Security Documents); - irrevocably authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Existing Intercreditor Agreement or other documents to which it is a party (including, without limitation, the Security Documents), together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each document, waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Security Agent on its behalf; and - accepted the terms and conditions of the Existing Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and authorized the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement. ----- The SSN Indenture provides that the Security Documents may be enforced only upon an acceleration of the amounts due under the Senior Secured Notes following an Event of Default. The Indenture also provides that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, only the Security Agent will have the right to enforce the Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee, the Holders and any other secured parties. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, Holders will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes, except through the Trustee under the SSN Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the SSN Indenture, the Existing Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security Documents) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the Collateral. Neither the Trustee nor the Holders may, individually or collectively, take any direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Security Documents. The Trustee and the Holders may only act through the Security Agent. The Trustee and the Security Agent will agree to any release of the security interests created by the Security Documents that is in accordance with the SSN Indenture and the Existing Intercreditor Agreement without requiring any consent of the Holders. The SSN Indenture provides that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Existing Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, the Senior Secured Notes and the SSN Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by security interests in the Collateral until all obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the SSN Indenture have been discharged. However, the Security Interests with respect to the Senior Secured Notes and the SSN Indenture may be released under certain circumstances as provided under “—Release of Liens.”",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Prior to the delivery or mailing of any notice of redemption of the Senior Secured Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the SSN Issuer or a SSN Guarantor or a successor to either, where applicable, will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the SSN Issuer or a SSN Guarantor or a successor to either, where applicable, is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied and (b) an opinion of an independent ----- tax counsel of recognized standing to the effect that the SSN Issuer or a SSN Guarantor or a successor to either, where applicable, has or have been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee and the Paying Agent will accept such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders. The foregoing provisions will apply mutatis mutandis to the laws and official positions of any jurisdiction in which any successor to the SSN Issuer is incorporated or organized or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or through which such successor makes any payment on the Senior Secured Notes or any SSN Guarantees, and any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein. The foregoing provisions will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the SSN Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of: (1) the Netherlands or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or therein having power to tax; (2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Senior Secured Note is made by the Payor or its agents, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax; or (3) any other jurisdiction in which the Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes, or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1), (2) and (3), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”), will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by a Payor or the Paying Agent with respect to any Senior Secured Note or SSN Guarantee, including payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by each Holder in respect of such payments, after such withholding, or deduction (including any such deduction or withholding from such Additional Amounts), will equal the amounts which would have been received by such Holder in respect of such payments on any such Senior Secured Note or SSN Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of: (1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any actual or deemed present or former connection between the relevant Holder or the beneficial owner of a Senior Secured Note (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder or beneficial owner, if the relevant Holder or beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or resident or national or domiciliary of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Senior Secured Note or the receipt of any payment in respect thereof; (2) any Tax that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Note to comply with a written request of the Payor addressed to the Holder or beneficial owner after reasonable notice, (at least 30 days before any such withholding or deduction would be made), to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part of such Tax but, only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation; ----- (3) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment on or with respect to the Senior Secured Notes or any SSN Guarantee; (4) any estate, inheritance, value added, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other governmental charge; (5) any Taxes imposed pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, any current or future regulations or official interpretations thereof, any agreements entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b) of the Code and any intergovernmental agreements (and related legislation or official administrative guidance) implemented with respect to the foregoing; or (6) any combination of the items (1) through (5) above. Such Additional Amounts will also not be payable (x) if the payment could have been made without such deduction or withholding if the beneficiary of the payment had presented the Senior Secured Note for payment (where presentation is permitted or required for payment) within 15-days after the relevant payment was first made available for payment to the Holder or (y) where, had the beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Note been the Holder, such beneficial owner would not have been entitled to payment of Additional Amounts by reason of any of clauses (1) to (6) inclusive above. In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to any payment to any Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or any person other than the beneficial owner of such Senior Secured Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner of such Senior Secured Notes would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner held such Senior Secured Notes directly. The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant taxing authority in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, in such form as provided in the ordinary course by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and as is reasonably available to the Payor and will provide such certified copies, or if, notwithstanding the Payor’s reasonable efforts to obtain such tax receipts, such certified copies are not available, certified copies of other reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee. Such certified copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent. If any Payor will be obliged to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any Senior Secured Note or any SSN Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee (copying the Paying Agent) an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee and the Paying Agent will be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary. Wherever in either the SSN Indenture or this “Description of the New Notes” there are mentioned, in any context: (1) the payment of principal; (2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Senior Secured Notes; (3) interest; or (4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Senior Secured Notes, such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof. The SSN Issuer will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary Taxes, or any other property or similar taxes, charges or levies that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, delivery, registration or enforcement of any Senior Secured Notes, the SSN Indenture, the Security Documents or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than, in each case, in connection with a transfer or ----- exchange of the Senior Secured Notes) and the SSN Issuer agrees to indemnify the Holders for any such Taxes paid by such Holders.

382_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1130,DESCRIPTION OF THE NEW NOTES,1130.17,Change of Control,1130.17.1,,"If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms hereof, each Holder will have the right to require the SSN Issuer to repurchase all of such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes (equal to € 100,000 aggregate principal amount, and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof; provided that Senior Secured Notes of €100,000 or less may only be purchased in whole and not in part) at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase; provided, however, that the SSN Issuer shall not be obligated to repurchase Senior Secured Notes as described under this “Change of Control” section in the event and to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of the Senior Secured Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived. Unless the SSN Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Senior Secured Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption”or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the SSN Issuer will mail a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder of any such Senior Secured Notes, with a copy to the Trustee: (1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require the SSN Issuer to purchase such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”); (2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed) and record date (the “Change of Control Payment Date”); (3) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control; (4) describing the procedures determined by the SSN Issuer, consistent with the SSN Indenture, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Senior Secured Notes repurchased; and (5) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control. On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the SSN Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Senior Secured Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Senior Secured Notes so tendered; (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the SSN Issuer in the Change of Control Offer; (4) in the case of Global Senior Secured Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent the Global Senior Secured Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the SSN Issuer; and (5) in the case of Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes accepted for purchase by the SSN Issuer. If any Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly wire to each Holder of Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Senior Secured Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate (or cause to be authenticated) and mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes a new Senior Secured Note equal in ----- aggregate principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Senior Secured Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Senior Secured Note will be in an aggregate principal amount that is at least €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. If and for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules of the Authority so require, the SSN Issuer will notify the Authority of any Change of Control Offer. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the SSN Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the SSN Issuer repurchase or redeem the Senior Secured Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the SSN Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third-party from seeking to consummate a transaction (including the acquisition of the Company and its Subsidiaries or the SSN Issuer and its Subsidiaries) that would constitute a Change of Control. The SSN Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third-party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth under this “Change of Control” section applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the SSN Issuer and purchases all Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. The SSN Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations (or rules of any exchange on which the Senior Secured Notes are then listed) in connection with the repurchase of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with provisions of the SSN Indenture, the SSN Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations (or exchange rules) and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations, or require a repurchase of the Senior Secured Notes, under the Change of Control provisions of the SSN Indenture by virtue of the conflict. The SSN Issuer may rely on any no action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. The SSN Issuer’s ability to repurchase Senior Secured Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. For example, the SSN Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by the SSN Issuer’s then existing financial resources. Under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the occurrence of a change of control of the Company would require the repayment of such debt, and under the Existing Indentures and the PIK Indenture, the occurrence of a change of control of the Company would require the SSN Issuer to make an offer to purchase the Existing Senior Secured Notes. As a result, there can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make the required repurchase of the Senior Secured Notes and the PIK Notes. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under other indebtedness of the Company or its Subsidiaries and require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under such agreements may not constitute a Change of Control under the SSN Indenture. Certain indebtedness of the Company or its Subsidiaries may prohibit the SSN Issuer from purchasing Senior Secured Notes in the event of a Change of Control or provide that a Change of Control is a default or requires repurchase upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the SSN Issuer to purchase the Senior Secured Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, other debt, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of the purchase on the SSN Issuer. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to _the New Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the New Notes upon the occurrence of a change of control as required by the Indenture and the change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may have the right to purchase all outstanding Notes in connection with a tender offer, even if certain holders do not consent to the tender.”_ Subject to the limitations discussed below, the SSN Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the SSN Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the SSN Issuer’s capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on the SSN Issuer’s ability to Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain ----- _Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions_ in the SSN Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the SSN Indenture does not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Specified Change of Control Event feature is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes and the Issuer. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of such phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and the decision whether to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as described above will in such circumstance be made in the good faith judgment of the SSN Issuer. The provisions of the SSN Indenture relating to the SSN Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

On the 366th day after an Asset Disposition, or at such earlier date that_ the SSN Issuer elects, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds under the SSN Indenture exceeds €30 million and has not been committed in accordance with clause (3)(b) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the SSN Issuer will be required to make an offer (“Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders and, to the extent the SSN Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and any such Pari passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Senior Secured Notes in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes and, in the case of any Pari passu Indebtedness, at an offer price of no more than 100% of the principal amount of such Pari passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the SSN Indenture or the agreements governing such Pari passu Indebtedness, as applicable, and, in the case of the Senior Secured Notes, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. To the extent that the aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and Pari passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the SSN Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to the other covenants contained in the SSN Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Senior Secured Notes and Pari passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Senior Secured Notes and Pari passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such aggregate principal amounts into their Euro Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the SSN Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Senior Secured Notes is denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the relevant Senior Secured Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of such Senior Secured Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Senior Secured Notes are denominated that is actually received by the SSN Issuer upon converting such portion into such currency. The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Senior Secured Notes, will remain open for a period of not less than five Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”).

The SSN Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the SSN Issuer in accordance with the terms of this covenant. The SSN Issuer or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five Business Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase price of the Senior Secured Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the SSN Issuer for purchase, and the SSN Issuer will promptly issue a new Senior Secured Note (or amend the Global Senior Secured Note), and the Trustee (or its authenticating agent), upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from the SSN Issuer, will authenticate and ----- mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) such new Senior Secured Note to such Holder, in an aggregate principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Senior Secured Note surrendered; provided that each such new Senior Secured Note will be in an aggregate principal amount with a minimum denomination of €100,000. Any Senior Secured Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book-entry) by the SSN Issuer to the Holder thereof. For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be cash: (1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness or other liabilities (other than contingent liabilities) of the Company (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company) or Indebtedness or other liabilities (other than contingent liabilities) of a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the SSN Issuer or a SSN Guarantor) and the release of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition; (2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary from the transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition; (3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Company and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition; (4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the SSN Issuer (other than Subordinated Indebtedness) received after the Original Issue Date from Persons who are not the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; and (5) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of €75 million and 2.0% of Total Assets (with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value). The SSN Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations (or rules of any exchange on which the Senior Secured Notes are then listed) in connection with the repurchase of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to the SSN Indenture.

Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and no action taken prior to the Reversion Date will constitute a Default or Event of Default. The “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of such Indenture except that no Default will be deemed to have occurred solely by reason of a Restricted Payment made during the continuance of the Suspension Event.

or (b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its Stated Maturity (the “cross acceleration _provision”),_ and, in each case, the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the aggregate principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates the greater of €70 million and 12% of Consolidated EBITDA; (6) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the SSN Issuer, the Company, a Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements of the Company), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”); (7) failure by the SSN Issuer, the Company, any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements of the Company), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of the greater of €70 million and 12% of Consolidated EBITDA (exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability for), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the judgment becomes final and due (the “judgment default provision”); (8) any security interest under the Security Documents on any Collateral having a fair market value in excess of the greater of €35 million and 6% of Consolidated EBITDA shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Existing Intercreditor Agreement and the SSN Indenture) for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the SSN Indenture or the release or amendment of any such security interest in accordance with the terms of the SSN Indenture, the Existing Intercreditor Agreement or such Security Document or any such security interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the SSN Issuer, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in writing that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Default continues for ten days (the “security default _provisions”); and_ (9) any SSN Guarantee of the Company or a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of such SSN Guarantee or the SSN Indenture) or is declared ----- invalid or unenforceable in a judicial proceeding or any SSN Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations under its SSN Guarantee and any such Default continues for ten days (the “guarantee _provisions”)._ However, a default under clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes notify the SSN Issuer of the default and, with respect to clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7), the SSN Issuer does not cure such default within the time specified in clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7), as applicable, of this paragraph after receipt of such notice. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (6) above) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the SSN Issuer or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes by written notice to the SSN Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Senior Secured Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (5) under “Events of Default”has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (5) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes, have been cured or waived. If an Event of Default described in clause (6) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Senior Secured Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes under the SSN Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium or interest, or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Senior Secured Note held by a non-consenting Holder, which may only be waived with the consent of Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Senior Secured Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of the SSN Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon. Subject to the provisions of the SSN Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the SSN Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability, fees or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the SSN Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holders have offered in writing the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability, fees or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and the offer of security and/or indemnity; and (5) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have not given the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60 day period. ----- Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture provides that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has written notice, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the SSN Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the SSN Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to security and/or indemnification satisfactory to it against all losses, liabilities, fees and expenses caused or incurred by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture provides that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the SSN Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the SSN Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Senior Secured Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The SSN Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The SSN Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the SSN Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Indenture provides for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is secured and/or indemnified to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Senior Secured Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of security or indemnification to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly. Holders may not enforce the SSN Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes except as provided in the SSN Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Existing Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. The Indenture provides that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”), then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) if any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the SSN Indenture, such Default or Event of Default, shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the SSN Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

We will not be required to register the transfer or exchange of Definitive Registered Notes for a period of 15 calendar days preceding (i) the record date for any payment of interest on the New Notes, (ii) any date fixed for redemption of the New Notes or (iii) any date fixed for selection of the New Notes to be redeemed in part. Also, we are not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Notes selected for redemption or which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a change of control offer or asset disposition offer. In the event of the transfer of any Definitive Registered Note, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar may require a holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents as described in the Indenture. We may require a holder to pay any taxes and fees required by law and permitted by the Indenture and the New Notes. If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Note has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Note is mutilated and is surrendered to the Registrar or at the office of the Transfer Agent, we will issue and the Trustee (or an authentication agent appointed by it) will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and our requirements are met. The Issuer or the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both to protect themselves, the Trustee or the Paying Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. The Issuer may charge for any expenses incurred by us in replacing a Definitive Registered Note. In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by the Issuer, pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer in its discretion, may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be. Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-entry Interests in the Global Notes only after the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such notes. Please see “Transfer Restrictions.” Payment of principal, any repurchase price, premium and interest on Definitive Registered Notes will be payable at the office of the Issuer’s paying agent in London. ----- To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar and their respective agents shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the New Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time at the registered office of the registrar, and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the New Notes. The Issuer will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the applicable series of Notes; however, owners of the Book-entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear and Clearstream.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar nor the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those operations or procedures. We understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

If the conditions above are satisfied, interest, including original issue discount, under the Notes will be subject to a Dutch withholding tax at a rate of 25%. An entity is considered a Related Entity if: (i) it has a Qualifying Interest in the Issuer; (ii) the Issuer has a Qualifying Interest in the Noteholder; or (iii) a third party has a Qualifying Interest in both the Issuer and the entity holding the Notes. The term Qualifying Interest means a direct or indirectly held interest—either by an entity individually or jointly if an entity is part of a collaborating group (samenwerkende groep)—that enables such entity or such collaborating group to exercise a definite influence over another entities' decisions, such as the Issuer or the Noteholder as the case may be, and allows it to determine the other entities' activities. A jurisdiction is considered low taxed if it is designated as such in an annually updated ministerial decree of the Dutch Ministry of Finance. At the date of this prospectus, the designated low taxed jurisdictions are the American Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Anguilla, the Bahamas, Bahrain, Barbados, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, Guernsey, Fiji, Guam, the Isle of Man, Jersey, the Cayman Islands, Palau, Panama, Samoa, Seychelles, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkmenistan, the Turks and Caicos Islands, Vanuatu and the United Arab Emirates.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Irrespective of the actual income or capital gains realized, the annual taxable benefit from_ a Dutch Resident Individual’s assets and liabilities taxed under this regime, including the New Notes, is set at a percentage of the positive balance of the fair market value of those assets, including the New Notes, and the fair market value of these liabilities. (i) from 1.8978% over the first €50,000 of such positive balance; (ii) to 4.5014% over any excess positive balance between €50,000.01 up to and including €950,000; and (iii) to a maximum of 5.69% over any excess positive balance of € 950,000.01 or higher. These percentages will be reassessed each year and the amounts under (i) to (iii) will be adjusted for inflation each year. No taxation occurs if this positive balance does not exceed a certain threshold (heffingvrij vermogen). The fair market value of assets, including the New Notes, and liabilities that are taxed under this regime is measured once in each calendar year on January 1. For 2021, the tax rate under the regime for savings and investments is a flat rate of 31%. _Dutch Resident Corporate Entities_ Dutch Resident Corporate Entities are generally subject to corporate income tax at statutory rates up to 25% on any benefits derived or deemed to be derived from the New Notes, including any capital gains realized on their disposal. _Non-Residents of the Netherlands_ The description of certain Dutch tax consequences in this paragraph is only intended for the following Noteholders: (i) individuals who are not resident and not deemed to be resident in the Netherlands (“Non-Dutch Resident Individuals”); and (ii) entities that are not resident and not deemed to be resident in the Netherlands (“Non-Dutch Resident Corporate Entities”). _Non-Dutch Resident Individuals_ A Non-Dutch Resident Individual will not be subject to any Dutch taxes on income or capital gains derived from the purchase, ownership and disposal or transfer of the New Notes, other than withholding tax as described above, unless: (i) the Non-Dutch Resident Individual derives profits from an enterprise, whether as entrepreneur or pursuant to a co-entitlement to the net worth of this enterprise other than as an entrepreneur or shareholder, and this enterprise is fully or partly carried on through a permanent establishment (vaste inrichting) or a permanent representative (vaste vertegenwoordiger) in the Netherlands, to which the New Notes are attributable; (ii) the Non-Dutch Resident Individual derives benefits from miscellaneous activities carried on in the Netherlands in respect of the New Notes, including activities which are beyond the scope of active portfolio investment activities; or (iii) the Non-Dutch Resident Individual is entitled to a share—other than by way of securities—in the profits of an enterprise, which is effectively managed in the Netherlands and to which the New Notes are attributable. ----- _Non-Dutch Resident Corporate Entities_ A Non-Dutch Resident Corporate Entity will not be subject to any Dutch taxes on income or capital gains derived from the purchase, ownership and disposal or transfer of the New Notes, other than withholding tax as described above, unless: (i) the Non-Dutch Resident Corporate Entity derives profits from an enterprise, which is fully or partly carried on through a permanent establishment or a permanent representative in the Netherlands to which the New Notes are attributable; or (ii) the Non-Dutch Resident Corporate Entity is entitled to a share—other than by way of securities—in the profits of an enterprise or a co-entitlement to the net worth of an enterprise, which is effectively managed in the Netherlands and to which the New Notes are attributable.

It does not present a comprehensive or complete description of all aspects of Dutch tax law which could be relevant to a holder of Notes (a “Noteholder”). For Dutch tax purposes, a Noteholder may include an individual or entity that does not hold the legal title of the New Notes, but to whom or to which, the New Notes are, or income from the New Notes is, nevertheless attributed based either on this individual or entity owning a beneficial interest in the New Notes or on specific statutory provisions. These include statutory provisions attributing Notes to an individual who is, or who has directly or indirectly inherited from a person who was, the settlor, grantor or similar originator of a trust, foundation or similar entity that holds the New Notes. This section is intended as general information only. Prospective Noteholders should consult their own tax adviser regarding the tax consequences of any acquisition, holding or disposal of Notes. This section is based on Dutch tax law as applied and interpreted by Dutch tax courts and as published and in effect on the date of this offering memorandum, including the tax rates applicable on that date, without prejudice to any amendments introduced at a later date and implemented with or without retroactive effect. Any reference in this section made to Dutch taxes, Dutch tax or Dutch tax law should be construed as a reference to any taxes of any nature levied by or on behalf of the Netherlands or any of its subdivisions or taxing authorities or to the law governing such taxes, respectively. The Netherlands means the part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands located in Europe. This section does not describe any Dutch tax considerations or consequences that may be relevant where a Noteholder: (i) is an individual and the Noteholder’s income or capital gains derived from the New Notes are attributable to employment activities, the income from which is taxable in the Netherlands; (ii) has a substantial interest (aanmerkelijk belang) or a fictitious substantial interest (fictief aanmerkelijk belang) in the Issuer within the meaning of chapter 4 of the Dutch Income Tax Act 2001 (Wet _inkomstenbelasting 2001). Generally, a Noteholder has a substantial interest in the Issuer if the_ Noteholder, alone or—in the case of an individual—together with a partner for Dutch tax purposes, or any relative by blood or by marriage in the ascending or descending line (including foster children) of the Noteholder or the partner, owns or holds, or is deemed to own or hold, certain rights to shares, including rights to directly or indirectly acquire shares, directly or indirectly representing 5% or more of the Issuer’s issued capital as a whole or for any class of shares or profit participating certificates (winstbewijzen) relating to 5% or more of the Issuer’s annual profits or 5% or more of the Issuer’s liquidation proceeds; (iii) is an entity that, although it is in principle subject to Dutch corporate income tax under the Dutch Corporate Income Tax Act 1969 (Wet op de vennootschapsbelasting 1969) (the “CITA”), is not subject to Dutch corporate income tax or is fully or partly exempt from Dutch corporate income tax (such as a qualifying pension fund as described in section 5 CITA and a tax exempt investment fund (vrijgestelde _beleggingsinstelling) as described in Section 6a CITA);_ (iv) is an investment institution (beleggingsinstelling) as described in Section 28 CITA; or (v) that is an entity which is a resident of Aruba, Curacao or St. Maarten and fully or partly conducts a business through a permanent establishment (vaste inrichting) or a permanent representative (vaste _vertegenwoordiger) in Bonaire, Sint Eustatius or Saba to which the New Notes are attributable._ -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

This summary does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects and deals only with New Notes that are held as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) by a U.S. Holder (as defined below) who acquires the New Notes upon their original issuance pursuant to the Offering at their “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of the New Notes of a series is sold to investors for cash, not including sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers). A “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of New Notes that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes any of the following: - an individual citizen or resident of the United States; - a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; - an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or ----- - a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations (“Treasury Regulations”) to be treated as a U.S. person. This summary is based upon the tax laws of the United States, including provisions of the Code, Treasury Regulations, rulings and judicial decisions, published administrative positions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and other applicable authorities, all as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be changed, perhaps retroactively, so as to result in United States federal income tax consequences different from those summarized below. We have not sought and will not seek any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will agree with our statements and conclusions or that a court would not sustain a challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation. A different tax treatment of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the New Notes from those discussed below could adversely affect the amount, timing and character of income, gain or loss in respect of an investment in the New Notes. This summary is general in nature and does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income tax or all tax considerations that may be relevant to U.S. Holders in light of their particular circumstances, and it does not address any state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences or any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws). In addition, it does not represent a detailed description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences applicable to U.S. Holders that are subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws. For example, this summary does not address: - tax consequences to holders who are dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities, banks, financial institutions, individual retirement and other tax-deferred accounts, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, S corporations, partnerships or other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes and investors in such entities, tax-exempt entities or insurance companies; - tax consequences to persons holding the New Notes as part of a hedging, integrated, constructive sale or conversion transaction or a straddle; - tax consequences to persons that have ceased to be U.S. citizens or permanent residents of the United States or entities covered by the anti-inversion rules; - tax consequences to U.S. Holders whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar; - persons who actually or constructively own more than 10% of our stock (by vote or value); - tax consequences of persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of gross income with respect to the New Notes being taken into account on an applicable financial statement; or - base erosion and anti-abuse tax under Section 59A of the Code, alternative minimum tax or Medicare contribution tax consequences, if any. If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the New Notes, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership. U.S. Holders that are partnerships, or partners of a partnership holding the New Notes, should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the New Notes. U.S. Holders considering the purchase of New Notes should consult their own tax advisors concerning the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences to them of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the New Notes, as well as the consequences to them arising under other U.S. federal tax laws and the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction. The following discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for careful tax planning and advice. If you are considering the purchase of New Notes, you should consult your own tax advisor concerning the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences to you of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the New Notes, as well as the consequences to you arising under any other tax laws, under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction or due to changes in tax law.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933
382_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1130,DESCRIPTION OF THE NEW NOTES,1130.46,Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations,1130.46.2,Characterization of the New Notes,"We may be required to pay additional amounts if certain taxes are withheld or deducted from payments on the New Notes (as described under “Description of the New Notes—Withholding Taxes”) or make additional payments in redemption of the New Notes in addition to their stated principal amount and accrued interest ----- (as described under “Description of the New Notes—Optional Redemption of the New Notes,” “Description of _the New Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the New Notes—Optional Redemption for Tax Reasons”). Although the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the payments of such_ additional amounts or additional payments in redemption of the New Notes does not result in the New Notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments under the applicable Treasury Regulations. This position will be based in part on our determination that, as of the Issue Date of the New Notes, the possibility that additional amounts will have to be paid is a remote or incidental contingency within the meaning of the applicable Treasury Regulations. Our determination that the New Notes are not contingent payment debt instruments is binding on a U.S. Holder, unless the U.S. Holder explicitly discloses to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) on its tax return for the year during which such U.S. Holder acquires the New Notes that it is taking a different position. However, our position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a contrary position to that described above, a U.S. Holder may be required to accrue interest income on its New Notes based upon a comparable yield, regardless of its method of accounting. The “comparable yield” is the yield at which we would issue a fixed rate debt instrument with no contingent payments, but with terms and conditions otherwise similar to those of the New Notes. In addition, any gain on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the New Notes generally would be recharacterized as ordinary income. Each U.S. Holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of the New Notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the New Notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933
382_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1130,DESCRIPTION OF THE NEW NOTES,1130.46,Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations,1130.46.3,Payments of Interest,"We expect, and this discussion assumes, that the New Notes will not be considered as issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The New Notes will be treated as issued without OID if the difference between their principal amount and their issue price is less than the product of onefourth of one percent (0.25 percent) of their principal amount multiplied by the number of full years to their maturity. In general, however, if the New Notes are issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. Holder will be required to include OID in gross income, as ordinary income, under a “constant-yield method”before the receipt of cash attributable to such income, regardless of the U.S. Holder’s regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, interest on a New Note generally will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary income at the time it is paid or accrued in accordance with the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition to interest on the New Notes, which includes any non-U.S. tax withheld from the interest payments received, a U.S. Holder will be required to include in income any additional amounts paid in respect of any such tax withheld and without reduction for any non-U.S. tax withheld from any such additional amounts. U.S. Holders may be entitled to deduct or credit non-U.S. withholding tax, subject to certain limitations (including that the election to deduct or credit non-U.S. taxes applies to all of the U.S. Holder’s applicable non-U.S. taxes for a particular tax year). Interest income (including any additional amounts) generally will be considered foreign source income and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credits, generally will be considered passive category income. The rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit under their particular circumstances. Interest on the New Notes will be payable in euros. A U.S. Holder who uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of the euro payment received, determined by translating the euros received at the spot rate on the date of receipt regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars. A cash basis U.S. Holder will not recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment, but such U.S. Holder may have exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the euros so received. A U.S. Holder who uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to such interest in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, the U.S. Holder will be required to include in income for each taxable year the U.S. dollar value of the interest that has accrued during such year, determined by translating such interest at the average rate of exchange for the period or periods during which such interest accrued or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. Holder, the part of the period within the taxable year. Under the second method, the U.S. Holder may elect to translate interest income at the spot rate on: - the last day of the accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years, the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the part of the period within each taxable year); or ----- - the date the interest payment is received if such date is within five business days of the end of the accrual period. If a U.S. Holder elects to use the second method, the election must be applied consistently to all debt obligations the U.S. Holder holds from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the advisability of making the above election. Whether or not such election is made, upon receipt of an interest payment on a New Note (including, upon the disposition of a New Note, the receipt of proceeds which include amounts attributable to accrued interest previously included in income), U.S. Holders who use the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognize exchange gain or loss (taxable as U.S. source ordinary income or loss) in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of such payment (determined by translating the euros received at the spot rate on the date of receipt) and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income the U.S. Holder previously included in income with respect to such payment, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars. Such gain or loss generally will constitute U.S. source gain or loss.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a New Note generally will be its U.S. dollar cost for that New Note decreased by the amount of any payments of principal previously made in respect of such Note. If a U.S. Holder sells or otherwise disposes of the New Notes in exchange for currency other than U.S. dollars, the amount realized generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the currency received. If the New Notes are traded on an established securities market when the U.S. Holder sells or otherwise disposes of the New Notes, the amount realized will be, in the case of cash basis and electing accrual basis U.S. Holders, determined using the spot rate on the settlement date. An accrual basis U.S. Holder that does not elect to determine the amount realized using the spot exchange rate on the settlement date will recognize foreign currency gain or loss equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the amount received based on the spot exchange rates in effect on the date of the sale or other disposition and the settlement date. A U.S. Holder will have a tax basis in the currency received equal to the U.S. dollar value of the currency received at the spot rate on the settlement date. Any foreign currency gain or loss realized on the settlement date or the subsequent sale or other disposition of the non-U.S. currency received for a different dollar amount generally will be U.S.-source ordinary income or loss, and will not be eligible for the reduced tax rate applicable to long-term capital gains. If an accrual basis U.S. Holder makes the election previously described, it must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be revoked without the consent of the IRS. Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, any gain or loss realized by a U.S. Holder from the sale, exchange redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a New Note generally will be capital gain or loss and will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder has held the New Note for more than one year at the time of the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the New Note. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. Holders (including individuals) generally are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Gain or loss realized by U.S. Holders on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a New Note generally will be treated as U.S. source gain or loss. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors about how to account for proceeds received on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a New Note that are not paid in U.S. dollars. Upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a New Note, a U.S. Holder may recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to the principal amount of the New Note. Exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss and generally will be U.S. source gain or loss. For these purposes, the principal amount of the New Note is a U.S. Holder’s purchase price for the New Note calculated in euros on the date of purchase, and the amount of exchange gain or loss recognized is equal to the difference between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined on the date of the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the New Note and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined on the date the U.S. Holder purchased the New Note. In addition, upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a New Note, an accrual basis U.S. Holder may recognize foreign ----- currency exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued interest which will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of Interest.” The amount of exchange gain or loss realized on the disposition of the New Note (with respect to both principal and accrued interest) will be limited to the amount of overall gain or loss realized on the disposition of the New Note.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Upon consummation of the IPO Pushdown references to the Company and_ the Restricted Subsidiaries (and all related provisions) in the Indenture shall apply only to the IPO Pushdown Entity and its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time, although the Issuer shall remain the same entity. In such event, each holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity would be released from its obligations under the Indenture. Such a modification to the terms of the New Notes could be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a deemed exchange of (i) the New Notes as in place prior to such modifications for (ii) modified New Notes as in place after such modifications (“Modified Notes”). If such modifications resulted in a deemed exchange, such a deemed exchange could be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes in which certain beneficial owners of the New Notes could be required to recognize gain or loss. The amount of any gain or loss recognized upon such a deemed exchange of a New Note for a Modified Note would be determined by reference to the “issue price” of the Modified Note. The issue price of a Modified Note will equal the fair market value of such New Note or such Modified Note at the time of the deemed exchange if, as seems likely, such New Note or such Modified Note were considered “publicly traded”for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the IPO Pushdown is treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. Holder’s holding period in a Modified Note treated as received in the IPO Pushdown generally will commence on the day after the IPO Pushdown, and tax basis in such Modified Note would generally equal the issue price of such Modified Note. Generally, any gain or loss recognized as a result of such deemed exchange will be taxed under the rules described below under “—Sale, Exchange, Redemption, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of New Notes.”If the issue price of such Modified Note is less than its stated redemption price at maturity by more than a de minimis amount, such Modified Note will be treated as issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such event, U.S. Holders would be required to include that original issue discount in their income as it accrues, in advance of the receipt of cash corresponding to such income. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to modification of the New Notes in connection with the IPO Pushdown, including the U.S. federal income tax considerations of a deemed exchange and resulting OID, if any.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

However, under proposed U.S. Treasury regulations issued in December 2018 (and upon which taxpayers may rely until final regulations are issued), such withholding does not apply to any “foreign passthru payment” that is made before the date that is two years after the date on which applicable final U.S. Treasury regulations defining “foreign passthru payments” are issued. Additionally, obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which applicable final Treasury Regulations defining “foreign passthru payments” are issued generally would be “grandfathered” unless such obligations are materially modified more than six months after such date. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, applicable final Treasury Regulations have not yet been filed. Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution, FATCA would apply to payments on the New Notes only if there is a significant modification of the New Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes after the expiration of this grandfathering period. Non-U.S. governments have entered into, and others are expected to enter into, intergovernmental agreements with the United States to implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules described herein. Investors should consult their own tax advisors on how these rules may apply to their investment in the New Notes.

Generally, any such payments to a foreign person that qualify as the payment of interest will be subject to withholding tax in Slovenia. No withholding tax is payable on the payment of principal. After a Slovenian Guarantor has settled an obligation on or under the New Notes or the Notes Guarantees, the Guarantor must establish a receivable towards the Issuer in the amount of the settled obligation. If a Slovenian Guarantor does not establish a receivable towards the Issuer, the payment made by the Guarantor on or under the New Notes or the Notes Guarantees might be characterized as a hidden distribution of profit (i.e., a payment of dividend to the Issuer). In this case, withholding tax would be due on the entire amount of the payment (and not only on the portion representing the payment of interest). According to Article 70 of the Slovenian Corporate Income Tax Act, withholding tax is imposed on certain income of non-residents from a Slovenian source, including dividends and income similar to dividends, interest (subject to certain exceptions), royalties, rent for Slovenian real estate, income from sports or art performances (through an intermediate entity) or from consulting, marketing, legal and certain other services when payments for such services are made to entities established in black listed countries (tax havens). The standard withholding tax rate is 15% and in certain situations in more detail regulated in the Tax Procedure Act it can, with effect from January 1, 2020, be 27.5%. It is the responsibility of the Slovenian payer (e.g., a legal entity, a sole entrepreneur, a business unit of a non-resident, for example, a Slovenian branch of a foreign company or an agent) to withhold the tax at the relevant rate at the time of payment of Slovenian sourced income. In certain cases it is, however, possible to apply for a reduced withholding tax rate or even an exemption from withholding tax. Such benefits may be available under double taxation agreements Slovenia has entered into with foreign countries. Moreover, Slovenia has fully transposed the EU Parent Subsidiary Directive (2011/96/EU) and the EU Interest and Royalty Directive (2003/49/EC) into its national law, which exempt transactions between certain types of companies from withholding tax, if the parties meet the requirements on the volume and the duration of shareholding.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

The general withholding tax rate is 10%, except for income generated from dividends, which is taxable at the rate of 5%, in each case unless a double taxation treaty, if any, provides otherwise.

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) no. 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the European Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings (the “E.U. Insolvency Regulation”), which applies within the European Union, other than Denmark, the courts of the Member State in which a company’s “centre of main interests” (which according to Article 3(1) of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation is “the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties”) is situated have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings. The determination of where a company has its “centre of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation the “centre of main interests” of a company is presumed to be in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. This presumption only applies if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Furthermore, preamble 30 of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation states that “it should be possible to rebut this presumption where the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State.” In that assessment factors such as where board meetings are held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the company’s creditors are established may all be relevant. A company’s “centre of main interests”may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition unless (as set forth above) the registered office has been moved within the three-month period prior to the filing of the insolvency petition. The E.U. Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings which are collective insolvency proceedings of the types referred to in Annex A to the E.U. Insolvency Regulation. If the “centre of main interests” of a company is in one Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open territorial insolvency proceedings against that company only if such company has an “establishment” in the territory of such other Member State. An “establishment” is defined to mean a place of operations where the company carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. The effects of those insolvency proceedings opened in that other Member State are restricted to the assets of the company situated in such other Member State. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the company has its centre of main interests have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can be opened in another Member State where the company has an establishment only where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the Member State in which the company’s centre of main interests is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of the establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where ----- the opening of territorial proceedings is requested or (ii) a public authority which, under the law of the Member State within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court opening the main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary proceedings have been opened there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in a Member State which has jurisdiction to open main proceedings (because the company’s center of main interests is there) may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of the company from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations so long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other Member State or any preservation measure taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the company has assets.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Accordingly, where the Issuer and the Dutch Guarantors have their “centre of main interests” or an “establishment in the Netherlands,” they may be subject to Dutch insolvency proceedings governed by Dutch insolvency laws, subject to certain exceptions as provided for in the E.U. Insolvency Regulation. In the event it was be determined by the court that the Issuer or any of the Dutch Guarantors has its centre of main interest outside of the EU, the Issuer or the relevant Dutch Guarantor may still be subjected to insolvency proceedings in the Netherlands due to the fact that the EU Insolvency Regulation would not apply. In that event the Dutch courts can claim jurisdiction based on the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet) because the Dutch Guarantor has its statutory seat in the Netherlands. There are two applicable corporate insolvency regimes under Dutch law in relation to corporations: (a) suspension of payments, which is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s debts and enable the debtor to continue as a going concern, and (b) bankruptcy (faillissement), which is primarily designed to liquidate and distribute the debtor’s assets to its creditors. Bankruptcy is the most commonly used insolvency regime and may result in the transfer of parts of the company as a going concern. A suspension of payments almost always results in the debtor’s bankruptcy. Both insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act. A general description of the principles of both insolvency regimes is set out below. This general description is subject to the proposals discussed under the heading “—Emergency Legislation to _Protect Enterprises in Financial Distress due to the COVID-19 Pandemic” below._ Only the debtor can make an application for a suspension of payments, and only if it foresees that it will be unable to continue to pay its debts as they fall due. Once the application has been filed, a court will immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional suspension of payments and appoint one or more administrators (bewindvoerders). A meeting of creditors is required to decide on the definitive suspension of payments, but it will generally be granted, unless a qualified minority (i.e., more than one quarter of the amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more than one third of the number of creditors of the ----- amount of claims held by creditors) of the unsecured, non-preferential, creditors declare against it or if there is a valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice the creditors during a suspension of payments or if there is no prospect that the debtor will be able to satisfy its creditors in the (near) future. The fact that the debtor must be able to satisfy its creditors does not mean that they must be paid in full. It suffices that creditors can be satisfied to some extent (for example, by receiving a percentage of their claims within the framework of a composition). Other than in the case of the ordering by a competent court of a statutory stay of execution of up to two months (extendable by another period of up to two months) imposed by court order, a suspension of payments will only affect unsecured, non-preferential creditors. During such stay of execution, a secured creditor may not, without the court’s consent (i) claim the asset subject to the security right if it is under the control of (in de macht van) the debtor subject to a suspension of payments or (ii) seek recourse against the asset. Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it has ceased to pay its debts. Bankruptcy can be requested by a creditor of the debtor or the holder of a security interest over a claim from such creditor, when there is at least one other creditor. At least one of the claims (of the creditor requesting bankruptcy or the other creditor) needs to be due and payable. Bankruptcy can also be declared in certain circumstances when a debtor is subject to a suspension of payments. The debtor can also request the application of bankruptcy proceedings itself, provided it has obtained prior approval of its general meeting to file an application for its bankruptcy. The articles of association of the debtor can preclude the necessity of such general meeting approval. Furthermore, the Public Prosecution Service (het Openbaar Ministerie) can request the application of bankruptcy proceedings for reasons of public interest (openbaar belang). In Dutch bankruptcy proceedings, a debtor’s assets are generally liquidated and the proceeds distributed to the debtor’s creditors according to the relative priority of those creditors’ claims and, to the extent certain creditors’ claims have equal priority, in proportion to the amount of such claims. Certain parties, such as secured creditors, will benefit from special rights. Secured creditors, such as pledgees and mortgagees, may enforce their rights separately from suspension of payments or bankruptcy and do not have to contribute to the liquidation costs; however, enforcement of the security interest might be subject to the following: (a) a statutory stay of execution of up to two months extendable by another period of up to two months imposed by court order pursuant to Article 63a of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (which may be a total period of eight months if the similar statutory stay of execution under Article 241a of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (referred to above) is first applied during suspension of payments), which has the same effects as set forth above for stays of execution in suspensions of payment; (b) a receiver (curator) can force a secured party to foreclose its security interest within a reasonable time (as determined by the receiver pursuant to Article 58(1) of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act), failing which the receiver will be entitled to sell the relevant rights or assets and distribute the proceeds to the secured party after a deduction of liquidation costs; and (c) excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned to the company’s receiver and may not be offset against an unsecured claim of the company’s secured creditor. Unlike Chapter 11 proceedings under U.S. bankruptcy law, where both secured and unsecured creditors are generally barred from seeking to recover on their claims, suspension of payment and bankruptcy proceedings against the Issuer and the Dutch Guarantors would allow secured creditors (and in case of suspension of payments also preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities)) to satisfy their claims by proceeding against the assets (that secure their claims) as if there were no bankruptcy or suspension of payments. However, a statutory stay of execution of up to two months, extendable by another period of up to two months, may be declared applicable. Furthermore, certain preferred creditors have a preference by virtue of law. Unlike secured creditors, preferred creditors are not entitled to foreclose on assets of the bankrupt. They do have priority in the distribution of the proceeds of the bankrupt’s assets. Restrictions on the enforcement of security interests may apply. For instance, higher ranking rights must be respected. These may include secured creditors and tax and social security authorities. A statutory stay of execution of security rights and other rights as described above may be imposed. Further, a receiver in bankruptcy can force a secured creditor to enforce its security interest within a reasonable period of time. If such time is not met, the receiver will be entitled to sell the secured assets, if any, and the secured creditor will have a preferred claim in respect of the proceeds, meaning that the secured creditor will have to share in the bankruptcy costs, which may be significant. Excess proceeds of any enforcement must be returned to the bankrupt estate; they may not be off set against an unsecured claim of the secured creditor. Such set-off may be allowed prior to the bankruptcy, although at that time it may be subject to clawback in the case of fraudulent conveyance or bad faith in obtaining the claim used for set-off. Any pending executions of judgments against the debtor will be suspended by operation of law when suspension of payments is granted and terminate by operation of law when bankruptcy is declared. In addition, all attachments on the debtor’s assets will cease to have effect upon the suspension of payments ----- having become definitive, a composition having been ratified by the court or the declaration of bankruptcy (as the case may be) subject to the ability of the court to set an earlier date for such termination. Litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically stayed. Under Dutch law, bankruptcy and suspension of payment generally take effect at 00.00 a.m. on the day of the judgment of the bankruptcy or the suspension of payments. Both in a definitive suspension of payments and bankruptcy, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to creditors. A composition will be binding for all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is: (i) approved by a simple majority (gewone meerderheid) of the number of creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% of the amount of the claims that are acknowledged and conditionally admitted, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Consequently, Dutch insolvency law could preclude or inhibit the ability of the holders of the New Notes to effect a restructuring and could reduce the recovery of a holder of Notes in a Dutch suspension of payments proceeding or bankruptcy. Interest accruing after the date on which a suspension of payments or bankruptcy is granted, cannot be claimed in a composition. All unsecured and non-preferential pre-bankruptcy claims will have to be verified in the insolvency proceedings in order to be entitled to vote and, in a bankruptcy liquidation, to be entitled to distributions. As a general rule, claims of unsecured and non-preferential creditors will have to be submitted to the receiver in bankruptcy to be verified. If the bankruptcy has ended with a composition, a claim that has not been submitted for verification within the deadline set therefore can no longer be enforced. Any remaining funds will be distributed to the company’s shareholders. “Verification” under Dutch law means, in the case of a suspension of payments, that the treatment of a disputed claim for voting purposes is determined and, in the case of a bankruptcy, the unsecured and non-preferential pre-bankruptcy claims are submitted to the receiver in bankruptcy for verification, and the receiver in bankruptcy then makes a determination as to the claim’s existence, ranking and value and whether and to what extent it should be admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings (for voting). In the situation of bankruptcy, creditors that wish to dispute the receiver’s verification of their claims will be referred to a claim validation proceeding (renvooiprocedure) in order to establish the amount and rank of the disputed claim, while in suspension of payments the court will decide how a disputed claim will be treated for voting purposes. These procedures could cause holders of Notes to recover less than the principal amount of their Notes or less than they could recover in a U.S. liquidation proceeding. The renvooi proceedings could also cause payments to the holders of Notes to be delayed. Interest on the New Notes accruing after the bankruptcy order date cannot be admitted unless secured by a pledge or mortgage, in which case interest will be admitted pro memoria. To the extent that an interest is not covered by the proceeds of the security, the creditor may not derive any rights from the admission. No interest is payable in respect of unsecured claims as of the date of a bankruptcy. Creditors of secured claims, such as the holders of the New Notes, and preferential creditors with respect to certain assets of a debtor, who expect that the proceeds of a future enforcement against the assets subject to the security or their preferred rights, as the case may be, will be insufficient to satisfy their claim in full, may request to receive the same rights as unsecured and non-preferential creditors with respect to the expected remainder of their claim, with preservation of their rights as a secured or preferential creditor in respect of the secured asset or the asset the relevant preferential right relates to. If a secured creditor enforces its security rights prior to the expiry of the period for submitting claims for verification, and the proceeds of such enforcement are insufficient to satisfy its claim in full, the remainder of that claim may be submitted to the receiver in bankruptcy in order to be verified. The Existing Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of Parallel Debt obligations in favor of the Security Agent. For any risks related to the Dutch law Parallel Debt structure, see “Risk Factors—Risks _Related to the New Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to you. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted by local law.”_ Under Dutch law, it is uncertain as to whether security interests can be granted to a party other than the creditor of the claim which is purported to be secured by such security interests. As a consequence, the Existing Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of parallel debt (Parallel Debt) obligations in favor of the Security Agent mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors towards the holders of the New Notes under or in connection with the Indenture (the Principal Obligations). The Dutch law security interests are, and will be, granted to the Security Agent as security for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the Principal Obligations. The Parallel Debt will be at all times in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations. Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the ----- corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the security interest granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the New Notes will not have direct security and will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security except through the Security Agent. As a result, the holders of the New Notes bear some risks associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt concept has not been tested under Dutch law and, to the extent that the security interests in the collateral created to secure the Parallel Debt are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the New Notes will not (directly) receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the collateral. However, the mechanism of Parallel Debt is commonly accepted and applied in the Dutch market. With the entry into force of the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans (Wet _homologatie onderhands akkoord) (“Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans”) on_ 1 January 2021, debtors now have the possibility to offer a composition outside of formal insolvency proceedings. The Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans is based on the UK Scheme of Arrangements and the US Chapter 11 procedure and it offers debtors additional possibilities to restructure their debt. Unlike a composition in suspension of payments and in bankruptcy, a composition under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans can be offered to secured creditors as well as shareholders. The Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans provides, inter alia, for cross class cramdown, the restructuring of group company obligations through either one or more aligned proceedings, the termination of onerous contracts with deactivation of ipso facto, and supporting court measures. Such composition may result in claims against the Dutch Guarantors being compromised if the relevant majority of creditors within a class or a more senior class vote in favor of such a composition. A composition plan under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans can extend to claims against entities that are not incorporated under Dutch law and/or are residing outside the Netherlands. Accordingly, the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans can affect the rights of the Trustee and/or the holders of the New Notes under the Indenture and therefore the New Notes. Under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans voting on a composition plan is done in classes. Approval by a class requires a decision adopted with a majority of two third of the claims of that class that have voted on the plan or, in the case of a class of shareholders, two thirds of the shares of that class that have voted on the plan. The Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans provides for the possibility for a composition plan to be binding on a non-consenting class (cross class cramdown). Under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans, the court will confirm a composition plan if at least one class of creditors (other than a class of shareholders) that can be expected to receive a distribution in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor approves the plan, unless there is a statutory ground for refusal. The court can, inter alia, refuse confirmation of a composition plan on the basis of (i) a request by an affected creditor of a consenting class if the value of the distribution that such creditor receives under the plan is lower than the distribution it can be expected to receive in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor or (ii) a request of an affected creditor of a non-consenting class, if the plan provides for a distribution of value that deviates from the statutory or contractual ranking and priority to the detriment of that class. Under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans, the court may grant a stay on enforcement of a maximum of 4 months, with a possible extension of 4 months. During such period, inter _alia, all enforcement action against the assets of (or in the possession of) the debtor is suspended, including_ action to enforce security over the assets of the debtor. Accordingly, during such stay a pledgee of claims may not collect nor notify the debtors of such pledged claims of its rights of pledge.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

The emergency legislation provides for a court ordered moratorium and several related_ protections which apply until at least August 1, 2021 and can, if and when necessary, be extended beyond that date for two month periods at a time. The measures of the legislation apply to enterprises (other than regulated entities) whose continuity is threatened due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to a request from creditors (other than the Tax authorities) to declare the enterprise bankrupt or initiate the execution or seizure of assets, the enterprise/ debtor can request the court to grant a moratorium vis à vis those creditors of two months (which may be extended twice at the request of the enterprise/debtor by two month periods at a time), and if such moratorium is granted by the court then during such period: ----- (i) the bankruptcy petition is stayed; (ii) payment obligations to those creditors are suspended, and any prior default does not, in and of itself, provide a legal basis to change the terms or suspend performance of, or terminate, an agreement with those creditors; and (iii) if the court so decides, conservatory and executory attachments by those creditors are suspended, and no other enforcement measures can (continue to) be taken by those creditors against the assets of their debtor without the prior approval of the court. The measures referred to in (iii) can also be requested in summary proceedings and attachments can be terminated as part of such proceedings. It is important to note that any measure of the court only affects those creditors who requested the bankruptcy or initiated the execution or seizure of assets of the debtor. However, any request by other creditors will most likely result in the court taking the same decisions. When considering the request to apply the measures discussed above, the court will need to establish that the enterprise/debtor has made it plausible that, solely or mainly due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the enterprise has not been able to continue its business as usual and as a result has temporarily become unable to pay its debts when they fall due. Creditors not covered by the moratorium retain these rights vis à vis their debtor. The enterprise/debtor is in any event presumed to be in this position if it can provide financial information that shows that prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic or the restrictive measures announced since March 15, 2020 (i) it had sufficient liquidity to satisfy its due and payable debts, and (ii) its revenue decreased by at least 20% compared to the average revenue in the preceding three-months. The court will further need to conclude that following the moratorium the enterprise/debtor will be able to satisfy its debts and that the creditor(s) that are affected are not significantly and unreasonably prejudiced as a result of the moratorium. When granting a moratorium, the court can take any measures it considers necessary to ensure the interests of the creditor(s) are not prejudiced.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933
382_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1131,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS,1131.2,The Netherlands,1131.2.3,,"Under Dutch law, the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors which are incorporated under Dutch law (the “Dutch Guarantors”) may be affected by (a) the standards of reasonableness and fairness (maatstaven _van redelijkheid en billijkheid); (b) force majeure (niet toerekenbare tekortkoming) and unforeseen circumstances_ (onvoorziene omstandigheden); and (c) the other general defenses available to debtors under Dutch law in respect of the validity, binding effect and enforceability of the New Notes. Other general defenses include claims that a security interest should be voided because it was entered into through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress (bedreiging) or error (dwaling). Other impeding factors include suspension of performance (opschorting), dissolution of contract (ontbinding) and set-off (verrekening). Furthermore, the courts of the Netherlands may change the effects of a contractual obligation on the basis of abuse of authority (misbruik van bevoegdheid). Moreover, enforcement of the Guarantees or security interests may be capable of being rescinded (vernietigd) as a result of lack of consensus ad idem (wilsgebreken) and the legal consequences thereof. The above only applies to obligations of the Issuer and the Dutch Guarantors that are governed by Dutch law. The validity and enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer and the Dutch Guarantors under the New Notes may be successfully contested by such Dutch company (or its administrator (bewindvoerder) in suspension of payments (surseance van betaling) or its receiver (curator) in bankruptcy) on the basis of an ultra vires claim, which will be successful if both (i) the obligations of the company do not fall within the scope of the objects clause as set out in the company’s articles of association (doeloverschrijding) and (ii) the company’s counterparty knew or ought to have known (without inquiry) of this fact. In determining whether a transaction is in furtherance of the objects and purposes of such Dutch company, a court will consider (i) the text of the objects clause in the company’s articles of association and (ii) all relevant circumstances including whether the granting of such security interest is in the company’s corporate interests (vennootschappelijk belang) and to its benefit and whether the company’s subsistence is jeopardized by the granting of such security interest. The mere fact that a certain legal act (rechtshandeling) is explicitly reflected in such Dutch company’s objects clause may not be conclusive evidence that such legal act is not ultra vires. In addition, it is relevant whether, as a consequence of the granting of the guarantee or security interest, the continuity of such Dutch company would foreseeably be endangered by the granting of such guarantee or security interest. It remains possible that even if a strong financial and commercial interdependence exists between contracting parties, the transaction may be declared void if it appears that the granting of the guarantee or security interest cannot serve the realization of the relevant Dutch company’s objects or where it is determined that there is a material imbalance to the disadvantage of the relevant Dutch company between the commercial benefit on the one hand and the risks on the other hand. A guarantee granted by a Dutch company and a security interest provided by a Dutch company may be suspended or avoided by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam (Ondernemingskamer _van het Gerechtshof te Amsterdam) on the motion of the holder or holders of 10% or more of the shares in_ such company or shares or depositary receipts issued therefor with a nominal value of €225,000 or more or such lesser amount as provided in the company’s articles of association. If the company has an issued share capital of at least €22.5 million, such motion may be made by a holder or holders of 1% or more of the shares in such company or, provided those are listed on a qualifying trading venue, shares or depositary receipts issued therefor with a value of €20 million or more or such lesser amount as provided in the company’s articles of association. A trade union, other entities or persons entitled thereto in the articles of association of, or in an agreement with, the relevant Dutch company as well as the company itself may also submit a motion to the Enterprise Chamber for this purpose. The guarantee or security itself may further be upheld by the Enterprise Chamber, yet actual payment under it may be suspended or avoided. ----- To the extent Dutch law applies, any creditor of any Issuer or Dutch Guarantor (or its administrator or receiver) may nullify any transaction or legal act entered into by any Issuer or Dutch Guarantor (or its administrator or receiver) in connection with the New Notes (which includes the issuance of the New Notes), under certain circumstances, if (i) any transaction or legal act entered into by any Issuer or Dutch Guarantor in connection with the New Notes was conducted without prior existing legal obligation to do so (onverplicht), (ii) the creditor(s) concerned or, in the case of its/their bankruptcy, any creditor was prejudiced as a consequence of such transactions or legal act (irrespective of whether a creditor’s claim arose prior to or after such transactions) and (iii) at the time of any transaction or legal act entered into by any Issuer or Dutch Guarantor in connection with the New Notes was conducted, such Issuer and/or Dutch Guarantors and, unless the transactions were conducted for no consideration (om niet), the counterparty knew or should have known that one or more of the entities’ creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced (actio pauliana). A receiver in bankruptcy may nullify a transaction on behalf of and for the benefit of the joint insolvent debtor’s creditors, and the burden of proof of the abovementioned elements of fraudulent conveyance in principle rests on the receiver. Knowledge of prejudice is however presumed by law for certain transactions performed within a “suspect period”of one year prior to an adjudication of bankruptcy. This is applicable for certain transactions only, the most important application being in cases where the obligations of the bankrupt materially exceed those of the other party, the satisfaction of existing obligations of the bankrupt which are not yet due, and acts between the bankrupt and its counterparty when the shares in both are held (indirectly) by the same shareholder or if the bankrupt and its counterparty are part of the same group of companies. The foregoing requirements for invoking fraudulent transfer provisions outside of a bankruptcy apply mutatis _mutandis when invoking fraudulent transfer provisions during a bankruptcy. In addition, the receiver may_ challenge a transaction if it was conducted on the basis of a prior existing legal obligation to do so (verplichte _rechtshandeling), if (i) the transaction was conducted at a time when the counterparty knew that a request for_ bankruptcy had been filed, or (ii) if such transaction was conducted as a result of deliberation between the debtor and the counterparty with a view to giving preference to the counterparty over the debtor’s other creditors. Consequently, the validity of any such transactions conducted by a Dutch legal entity may be challenged and it is possible that such a challenge would be successful. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the Dutch Guarantors or any of their subsidiaries experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations and the security of the Issuer and the Dutch Guarantors.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933
382_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1131,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS,1131.3,Slovenia,1131.3.1,Certain Slovenian Companies and Insolvency Law Considerations,"The granting of up-stream or cross-stream guarantees and security under Slovenian law is limited. According to the Slovenian Companies Act (Zakon o gospodarskih družbah—ZGD 1—Companies Act), as amended, joint stock companies are prohibited from providing funds to anyone for the purpose of acquiring the companies’ shares and from guaranteeing or otherwise securing the repayment of such funds. While the statutory restrictions of financial assistance expressly refer only to joint stock companies and the acquisition of their shares, it is possible that a court would also apply these rules to the acquisition of shares of a direct or indirect parent of the relevant joint stock company or for limited liability companies. Given the prohibition on financial assistance, it is not certain if a Slovenian joint stock company may provide upstream or cross stream guarantees. Setting aside the financial assistance prohibition, the amount of the guarantee should in any event not exceed whatever amounts the company receives in consideration for providing the guarantee. Guarantees and other types of security granted by a company for purposes other than the acquisition of its own shares are not covered by the financial assistance rules and instead must be analyzed in light of the capital maintenance provisions of the Companies Act, which apply to limited liability companies and joint stock companies. Such rules provide for (i) in respect of limited liability companies a prohibition of making payments to the shareholder or making a legal transaction with a similar legal effect (e.g. guarantee with its assets for any indebtedness of the shareholder) to the extent that this would prevent preservation of the company’s (1) minimal lawfully allowed share capital (najnižji znesek osnovnega kapitala) (being EUR 7,500), (2) actually registered share capital (osnovni kapital) and (3) tied up reserves (vezane rezerve), and (ii) in respect of joint stock companies a prohibition of return of equity (prepoved vračila vložkov) and a prohibition of concealed payment of profit (prepoved prikritega izplačila dobička). Pursuant to these rules, a shareholder is generally only entitled to participate in a company’s distributable profit but has no rights with respect to the company’s assets except in the case of the winding up of the company. Thus, any payment by a company to a shareholder, including any other transfer of economic benefits, that is not profit participation is generally prohibited. As the grant by a company of a guarantee or other type of security for the benefit of one of its shareholders to secure an obligation of such shareholder towards a third-party or to secure the obligation of another company forming part of the same group gives rise to a material benefit to the shareholder, the grant of such ----- guarantee or security is subject to the capital maintenance rules and thus permitted only if certain legal requirements are met. A limited liability company may not pay any portion of its share capital and tied up reserves to shareholders, either directly or indirectly. This means that the grant of a guarantee or other security by a company for the benefit of a shareholder is permitted only to the extent that the amount covered by the guarantee or security does not endanger the company’s share capital and tied up reserves. To the extent the amount in question does endanger the company’s share capital and tied up reserves, the guarantee or other security is permitted only if the grant of the security is commercially justified based on arm’s length principles. This is the case if the benefits to the company outweigh the risks involved and the grant does not affect the company’s liquidity, e.g., if adequate security for the potential liability is provided to the company or there are other benefits to the company. Under no circumstances, however, must a company grant a guarantee or other type of security if doing so could reasonably be expected to affect its liquidity or lead to its insolvency (e.g., because the beneficiary of the guarantee has a particularly low degree of creditworthiness)—even if the company receives a monetary equivalent from the shareholder, as in such case the grant of the guarantee or other security is never commercially justified. Similar rules apply in respect of a joint stock company, with the additional limitation that a joint stock company is prohibited from any payment which would represent a return of equity or a concealed payment of profit. If a company grants a guarantee or other type of security to a shareholder in contravention of the capital maintenance rules, the shareholder must pay-back the received benefit. If the shareholder was acting bona fide, the repayment may only be requested if it is needed for repayment of a company’s debt to its creditors. The liable shareholder may not be set free of its repayment obligations. The prescription period for the repayment starts to lapse with the day when the unjustified payment was made. In addition, any violation of the capital maintenance or financial assistance rules exposes the directors or managers of the Slovenian Guarantor to personal and criminal liability. In addition, the guarantee could itself be held null and void.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933
382_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1131,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS,1131.3,Slovenia,1131.3.2,Insolvency Law,"For Slovenian law purposes, insolvency is (in summary) defined as a situation where a debtor is unable to settle its obligations as they fall due for a certain period of time. Unless proven otherwise, a debtor is deemed insolvent if: - the debtor is more than two months late in paying one or more of its obligations that together exceed 20% of all of its obligations, as shown in the debtor’s latest published annual report; or - the monies standing to the credit of the debtor’s bank account are not sufficient to pay the whole amount enforceable under a writ of execution (sklep o izvršbi) or to pay the enforcement draft (izvršnica), and such status continues for 60 consecutive days or for more than 60 days within a period of 90 days, and still exists on the day preceding the filing of the bankruptcy petition; or - the debtor does not have an account with a payment services provider in Slovenia and in the 60 days following the finality of the writ of execution has not settled its obligations deriving therefrom, or - after the final confirmation of a compulsory settlement or simplified compulsory settlement over the debtor, if the debtor is more than two months late with the payment of its obligations under the (simplified) compulsory settlement or with the payment of obligations towards secured creditors that arose before the (simplified) compulsory settlement proceedings commenced or with any other financial restructuring measures stipulated in the financial restructuring plan; or - the value of the debtor’s obligations exceeds the value of its assets; or - the debtor’s current year loss together with any loss brought forward from previous years is equal to, or greater than, half of its subscribed capital, and that loss cannot be covered by the profit brought forward or reserves. Further, the debtor is deemed insolvent (and is not allowed to prove otherwise) if it is over two months late in paying its employees their salaries up to the amount of minimum salaries or taxes and contributions that are paid together with salaries, and that delay still exists on the day preceding submission of a petition for the filing of the insolvency petition. Additionally, it is possible that certain Slovenian laws regulating intervention measures in respect of the COVID-19 pandemic include additional non-rebuttable presumptions of ----- insolvency. For instance, until September 30, 2020, a debtor was also deemed insolvent (without the option to prove otherwise) if it was late in paying the salaries and salary related contributions for more than one month from the day it received certain reimbursements based on the intervention measures adopted with the aim of retaining employment in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Under Slovenian law, the following types of insolvency proceedings may be opened against a company having its centre of main interest in Slovenia within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation: - bankruptcy proceeding (stečaj). The opening of these types of proceedings may be requested by the company, any personally liable shareholder of the company, any of its creditors, or the Public Guarantee and Maintenance Fund of the Republic of Slovenia (this fund provides protection of rights of those workers whose employment was terminated due to employer insolvency). During bankruptcy proceedings, the bankrupt company is administered by a bankruptcy administrator. - compulsory settlement proceeding (prisilna poravnava). The opening of these types of proceedings may be requested by the company, a personally liable shareholder of the company or by creditors of the company whose combined financial claims amount to more than 20 per cent of the company’s financial obligations. The purpose of the compulsory settlement procedure is to enable a debtor that became insolvent to financially restructure, providing for its liquidity and solvency, and to ensure the creditors receive more favorable payment conditions for their claims than in the case of bankruptcy proceedings. - simplified compulsory settlement proceeding (poenostavljena prisilna poravnava). Simplified compulsory settlement proceedings are permitted, if the debtor is a micro sized company (as specified in the Slovenian Companies Act based on the following criteria: the average number of employees in a business year, the net proceeds from sales and the value of the assets) or a sole proprietor who meets the criteria stated in the Slovenian Companies Act for micro or a small sized companies. The opening of these types of proceedings may be requested only by the debtor (company/sole proprietor) or a personally liable shareholder of the company. In the event that a company is at risk of becoming insolvent within one year, a company (other than a micro sized company) may restructure its financial liabilities in so called preventive restructuring proceedings (postopek preventivnega prestrukturiranja) in order to reduce the risk of insolvency. Preventive restructuring proceedings are not considered to be insolvency proceedings in the technical sense. This is because they enable a company to take financial restructuring measures in order to avoid becoming insolvent by entering into an agreement for a financial restructuring with its creditors. In relation to secondary proceedings within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation, if an entity has an establishment in Slovenia, the only insolvency proceedings that may be opened are bankruptcy proceedings (stečaj). In the event of a liquidation of a Slovenian Guarantor following bankruptcy, the liability of the Slovenian Guarantor in respect to the New Notes will only rank after the cost of the liquidation proceedings (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and any debts of the relevant entity that enjoy a more senior or preferential status under the Slovenian law. Preferential debts may include, among others: - remuneration owed to employees for the last six months preceding the insolvency proceeding; - compensation (damages) for work related accidents and occupational diseases; - redundancy payments for workers dismissed prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings; and - taxes and social security contributions related to the remuneration (for the period of the last six months) and redundancy payments as well as social security contributions for a period prior to the opening of the insolvency proceeding. Assets over which a security interest has been granted will, in principle, not be available for distribution to unsecured and un preferred creditors, unless a surplus is realized. Certain legal actions of a debtor in an insolvency procedure can be challenged in court if they were concluded or carried out during the twelve month period prior to the submission of a petition for beginning of the insolvency procedure. A legal action of an insolvent debtor may be challenged if such action results in either a decrease in the net value of assets of the debtor, so that the pool of assets available to other creditors is reduced, or a person for the benefit of whom the act has been executed, having obtained more favorable payment conditions for a ----- claim against the debtor in bankruptcy, and a person for the benefit of which the act was executed, at the time when such act was executed, was aware of, or should have been aware of, the fact that the debtor was insolvent. If the other person did not provide any exchange (consideration) or if the value of such exchange was small, such legal action can be challenged if it was concluded during a period of 36 months prior to the filing of the motion for the commencement of insolvency proceedings and even if the other person was not aware of or did not need to be aware of the fact that the debtor was insolvent. Challenging of legal actions is also available under general rules of Slovenian civil law (i.e. also outside insolvency). In general, the opening of insolvency proceedings by a Slovenian court does not result in the automatic termination of contracts; however the insolvency administrator may choose to terminate certain contracts as to avoid the worsening of the financial condition of the company.

Therefore, the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over assets such as registered shares in Slovenian companies, tangible assets located in Slovenia, receivables/claims governed by Slovenian law and having debtors located in Slovenia, bank accounts held in Slovenia, etc. will be subject to Slovenian law. Under Slovenian law, it is uncertain as to whether security interests can be granted to a party other than the creditor of the claim that is purported to be secured by such security interests. As a consequence, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of parallel debt (Parallel Debt) obligations in favor of the Security Agent mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors towards the holders of the New Notes under or in connection with the Indenture (the Principal Obligations). The Slovenian law security interests will be granted to the Security Agent as security for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the Principal Obligations. The Parallel Debt will be at all times in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations. Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the security interest granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the New Notes will not have direct security and will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security except through the Security Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt construct has not been tested under Slovenian law and, to the extent that the security interests in the collateral created to secure the Parallel Debt are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the New Notes will not (directly) receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the collateral.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933
382_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1131,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS,1131.3,Slovenia,1131.3.4,Enforcement Proceedings,"Under Slovenian law, depending on the type of security certain perfection requirements must be satisfied in order for a security to become enforceable against third parties. If these perfection requirements are not satisfied a holder of security interest may experience difficulties enforcing its rights with respect to the collateral against third parties, including administrators in insolvency proceedings or other creditors that claim a security interest in the same collateral. - In the case of a pledge over the shares of a limited liability company, the agreement must be drawn up in the form of a notarial deed and registration of the security interest in the court register of the relevant Slovenian company is required. If a secured claim is not settled at maturity, the shares may be sold through (i) a court enforced sale or (ii) an out of court sale. If the security agreement is concluded between commercial entities, it is presumed that the parties agreed on an out of court sale; in all other cases, the parties must conclude an agreement on an out of court sale in writing. ----- - In case of a pledge over the shares of a joint stock company, the security interest must be entered in the central register maintained by the KDD (Slovene Central Securities Clearing Corporation). - In case of a pledge over receivables, the pledgor must notify the debtor of the pledged receivable. Upon receipt of the notification, the debtor of the pledged receivable may only validly pay to the pledgee and the pledgee is not required to initiate a procedure against the pledger, but can demand and enforce the payment directly against the debtor of the pledged receivable. In case of a pecuniary claim, the creditor must, at the request of the pledger, deposit the collected amount with the court. Court enforcement proceedings are regulated by the Slovenian Enforcement and Securing of Civil Claims Act (Zakon o izvršbi in zavarovanju—ZIZ—Enforcement Act). According to the Enforcement Act, enforcement procedures may be commenced only upon obtaining a valid enforcement title which may be in the form of either (i) an enforceable court decision, (ii) a court settlement, (iii) an enforceable notarial deed, or (iv) another enforceable decision or instrument that is an enforceable title according to the law, a ratified and published international treaty or a legal act of the European Union that is directly applicable in the Republic of Slovenia. Therefore, if an agreement is drawn up in the form of a directly enforceable notarial deed (with all documents and attachments in certified Slovenian translations), the enforcement procedure may be commenced without any further litigation. The enforcement procedure starts with the creditor filing a proposal for enforcement. In this proposal, the creditor must provide information about the legal title upon which the enforcement is based, the debtor’s obligation, the enforcement measure or the relevant debtor’s assets that are targeted by the procedure (objects of enforcement). There is no deadline for the court to decide on the enforcement proposal. In practice, in most cases the court reaches a decision within about two weeks. As long as there is a valid enforcement title, courts will generally grant the enforcement. The debtor and any third-party with a right to the object of enforcement that prevents enforcement may file an objection against a decision granting enforcement. Any costs associated with an enforcement procedure (court fees, bailiff fees, etc.) are initially borne by the person filing a proposal for enforcement, however, after the sale of a security interest, any distribution proceeds are first used to reimburse the costs and expenses of the enforcement procedure. The Enforcement Act regulates in detail the enforcement procedures with respect to different types of assets (e.g., enforcement over real estate, receivables, movables and similar) as well as the procedures with respect to different types of claims (e.g., monetary claims, claims regarding the handing over of a real estate or movables and similar). The means of enforcement of monetary claims under the Enforcement Act are: - enforcement by seizing movables, appraisal of their value, sale of the movables and repayment of a creditor from the money acquired through the sale of the movables; - enforcement by seizing a monetary claim of a debtor and transferring the monetary claim to a creditor; - enforcement by blocking a debtor’s assets on bank accounts and transferring the blocked assets to a creditor after the required conditions are met; - enforcement by seizing a debtor’s claim to have certain (im)movables handed over to it, transferring this claim to the creditor and sale of the object; - enforcement by seizing and monetizing other assets or material rights of a debtor (e.g., a patent, right to usage and similar); - enforcement over securities; - enforcement over business shares by registering enforcement in the business registry and selling the business shares; and - enforcement over real estate with a registration of the enforcement into the real estate register, appraisal of the value of the real estate, sale of the real estate and repayment of a creditor from the money acquired through the sale of the real estate. Certain assets of the debtor may not be subject of enforcement, whereby generally such limitations do not apply, among others, to enforcement of claims secured with a pledge over such assets. When enforcement is pursued out of court (when so allowed by the law, and, if so required, agreed contractually): ----- - a share in a limited liability company or the shares in a joint stock company can generally only be sold in a public auction (whereby certain Slovenian legal scholars argue that any kind of invitation made to the public to purchase or provide bids is sufficient). Exceptionally, a direct sale (i.e. without a public auction) is allowed if the shares (of a joint stock company) have a stock exchange price. The auction or the direct sale (as applicable) can be performed after an 8 day prior notice to the debtor of the secured claim and to the pledgor (if not the same person). The pledgee must timely notify both the debtor of the secured claim and the pledgor of the date and place of the sale. Any surplus of the proceeds over the secured claim must be delivered to the pledgee; - enforcement over a pledged receivable is performed by collection of the receivable from the debtor or, in case of bankruptcy or compulsory settlement, by reporting the right to separate repayment in the respective proceedings and repayment in the context of such proceedings; and - blank signed bills of exchange can be enforced by due completion of the blank places and submission for payment from the respective bank account of their issuer.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

The debtor is unable to pay its debts within 45 days from their due date or has completely ceased all payments for a consecutive period of 30 days; permanent insolvency is presumed if the petition for the opening of insolvency procedures is filed by a creditor who was unable to obtain satisfaction of his monetary claims by any of the means of enforcement in a judicial or tax enforcement proceeding in Serbia. - Pending (threatening) insolvency. The debtor is able to prove that he will likely not be able to pay its existing debts as they become due. - Over indebtedness. The liabilities of the debtor exceed its assets. - Failure to comply with the adopted reorganization plan or if the reorganization plan was put into effect in a fraudulent or unlawful manner. The opening of insolvency proceedings (stečaj) may be requested by any of the debtor’s creditors, the debtor itself or the debtor’s liquidation administrator. During the insolvency proceedings, the estate (assets) of the insolvency debtor, and the debts, are administered by the insolvency administrator. The insolvency proceedings may be conducted as bankruptcy proceedings or as reorganization proceedings. In bankruptcy proceedings, creditors are satisfied through the sale of the debtor’s assets, or the sale of the debtor as a legal entity. In reorganization proceedings, creditors are satisfied by redefinition of their relations (haircut and/or reprogram) with the debtor or in another manner provided for in the plan. There are two types of procedures for adoption of a reorganization plan (i.e. two types of reorganization): (i) regular procedure, after the formal opening of insolvency proceedings and (ii) prepacked reorganization (i.e., reorganization on the basis of a prepacked reorganization plan submitted by the insolvency debtor jointly with the proposal for initiation of insolvency proceeding (provided any of the grounds for the opening of insolvency proceeding exist)). Although the two types of reorganizations are similar, the main difference is, besides the timing of the submission of a draft reorganization plan, in that the prepacked reorganization plan includes, inter alia, signed non-binding statements of the majority of creditors per value of their claims from each class specified in the plan, that they agree with the contents of the proposed prepacked reorganization plan and are willing to vote for its adoption. Another important difference between these reorganizations is in that if a prepacked reorganization plan is not adopted, the insolvency proceedings terminate, while if a reorganization plan is not adopted in the pending insolvency proceedings, the proceedings continue as bankruptcy. A prepacked reorganization may be initiated only by the debtor, while a reorganization plan in a regular procedure may be submitted by: (i) the insolvency administrator; (ii) any secured creditor; (iii) any insolvency creditor; and (iv) shareholders holding at least 30% of the debtor’s issued share capital. The claims are satisfied in the following order: - expenses associated with the insolvency proceedings, which are settled from the insolvency estate as a matter of priority; - any obligations incurred by the insolvency estate; and ----- - the claims of insolvency creditors, which are satisfied according to their rank. Insolvency claims are ranked as follows: - first-ranking claims comprise (i) unpaid net salaries of employees and former employees in the amount of a yearly minimum wage for the year prior to the opening of insolvency together with interest from the due date to the date of the opening of insolvency; (ii) unpaid contributions for mandatory pension and disability insurance for two years prior to the opening of insolvency and (iii) claims arising from contracts with companies the subject of which are unpaid contributions for mandatory pension and disability insurances for two years before the opening of insolvency (the basis for the calculation of the contributions under (ii) and (iii) is the minimum monthly social security contributions basis as at the date of opening of insolvency proceedings); - second ranking claims comprise all public revenue claims that have become due over the last three-months prior to the opening of insolvency, except mandatory pension and disability insurance contributions for employees; - third ranking claims comprise claims of other insolvency creditors (unsecured claims); and - fourth ranking claims comprise claims that arose within two years before the opening of the insolvency proceedings under or in connection with loans or other economically equivalent transactions to the extent such loans or equivalent transactions are unsecured and were granted by an affiliate of the debtor who is not regularly engaged in the business of providing credits and loans. Claims of creditors which have, prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings, contractually agreed to subordination will be settled only after the settlement in full of the third ranking claims with accompanying interest(s). Assets over which security interests have been granted are generally not available for distribution to unsecured and non-preferred creditors, unless a surplus is realized from the sale of such assets. The following three types of creditors are not considered to be insolvency creditors: - secured creditors (razlučni poverioci), i.e., creditors who have a pledge right (založno pravo), statutory retention right, or a right of settlement on the assets or rights recorded in public records. They are entitled to primary settlement from the proceeds of the sale of the assets or the collection of claims over which that right has been granted. If a secured creditor’s claim exceeds such proceeds, the secured creditor is an insolvency creditor with respect to the remaining portion of its claim. Secured claims acquired through enforcement proceedings or creating of a charge within 60 days before the date of opening the insolvency proceedings for the purpose of enforcement or security shall cease to be valid; such creditors shall not be deemed secured creditors. - pledge creditors (založni poverioci), i.e., persons who have a pledge over property or rights of the debtor that is recorded in the public records, but do not have a monetary claim (secured by such pledge) against the debtor (i.e., the monetary claim secured by that pledge is a claim of a third-party), must inform the court about the pledge within a specified deadline and provide evidence of the existence of the relevant pledge together with a statement of the amount of the secured monetary claim against third-party (as of the date of the opening of the insolvency proceedings). Pledge creditors may not vote for, nor be voted as, members of an insolvency creditors’ assembly or an insolvency creditors’ committee; and - separation creditors, i.e., persons who on the basis of their property rights or personal rights, have the right to request a certain asset to be excluded from the insolvency estate. Separation creditors are not insolvency creditors. However, in a case where the bankruptcy debtor has transferred these assets in the course of insolvency proceedings without being authorized to do so, a separation creditor has the right to request satisfaction of its claim in an amount equal to the market value of the asset plus compensation of damage, and such request is to be settled as a liability of the insolvency estate (in priority over claims of insolvency creditors). Legal transactions and other actions entered into or taken before the opening of the insolvency proceedings that interfere with the principle of the equal settlement of insolvency creditors or are damaging the creditors, as well as transactions and actions putting some creditors in a more favorable position over other creditors (“favoring creditors”) may be contested by the insolvency administrator or by other creditors: - Any action providing security or settlement to a creditor in a manner and at a time that corresponds to the substance of such creditor’s right (“regular settlement”) taken within six months before the filing of a petition for initiation of insolvency proceedings may be contested if the debtor was insolvent at the time of ----- the transaction, and the creditor knew or should have known of its insolvency. Regular settlements after the filing of the petition to open insolvency proceedings may also be contested if the creditor knew or should have known that the debtor was insolvent or if the creditor knew that the petition to initiate insolvency proceedings has been filed. - Any action benefiting one creditor which he was not entitled to request, or was entitled to request but not in the manner as, and at the time when, it was provided, may be contested if it was carried out within twelve months before filing the petition to open insolvency. Any action directly damaging the debtor’s creditors may be contested if: - it was entered into within six months before filing for insolvency, if the insolvency debtor was insolvent at the time and the counterpart knew of its insolvency; - the transaction was concluded after the filing of the petition aimed at initiating insolvency proceedings, if the insolvency debtor’s counterpart knew or should have known that the insolvency debtor was insolvent or that the filing for the opening the insolvency had been made; and - the debtor’s action results in a waiver of some of its rights or if the failure of the debtor to act results in its inability to exercise that right and the action was taken or omitted within the last six months before the filing of the petition to open the insolvency proceeding. Any transaction entered into or taken within five years before the filing of the petition for initiation of insolvency proceedings or after that, with the intent to damage one or more creditors, may be contested if the insolvent debtor’s counterpart knew of the insolvent debtor’s intent. Knowledge of the debtor’s intent is presumed if the insolvent debtor’s counterpart knew that there was a threat of the insolvent debtor’s insolvency and that the action would damage the insolvency creditors or that the debtor has received no value or no adequate value as a consideration for performance of its obligation. In addition, any security the debtor granted under a loan (or under any other legal action that, in economic terms, corresponds to a loan) to an affiliate, provided that such affiliate is not regularly engaged in the business of granting credits or loans, at a time when the debtor was permanently insolvent, or within one year prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings, has no legal effect in the insolvency proceedings. Also, if a debtor has repaid a credit or a loan in the year immediately preceding the opening of insolvency proceedings to an affiliated person which is not regularly engaged in the business of granting credits or loans, the debtor is deemed to have deliberately jeopardized creditors and such repayment may be contested as an intentional damaging of creditors. The court order on the opening of insolvency proceedings has certain consequences. For example, insolvency creditors may satisfy their claims against the debtor only in insolvency proceedings. Undue claims against the insolvency debtor are deemed due as of the date of opening of the insolvency. All judicial proceedings against the insolvent debtor and its assets and all administrative proceedings initiated at the request of the insolvent debtor and the administrative and tax proceedings aimed at establishing a pecuniary obligation on the insolvent debtor are suspended and resume only after the fulfillment of certain conditions. No enforcement proceedings may be conducted against the debtor or its assets for the purpose of settling the claims, except for the enforcement of liabilities of the insolvency estate and expenses of the insolvency proceedings. Enforcement ban can be temporarily lifted for a period of nine months in favor of secured creditors in certain cases, in order to allow them to enforce their claims through the sale of the collateral. The initiation of insolvency proceedings does not result in automatic termination of contracts; but the insolvency administrator may choose to terminate certain executory contracts to avoid the worsening of the financial condition of the company.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Registration is performed on the basis of a (Stakes) Pledge_ Agreement. The (Stakes) Pledge Agreements must be made in writing. In case of pledge over stakes (i.e., share(s) in limited liability company), the (Stakes) Pledge Agreement also has to be notarized by a notary public. Material amendments to the obligation secured by the (stake) pledge (e.g., legal basis, principal amount, term, interest rate) require amendments to and registration with the competent authorities of a security document ----- (e.g., (Stakes) Pledge Agreement). Under the Secured Transactions Act, any amendment to a security document (e.g., (Stakes) Pledge Agreement) which would alter essential elements of the relevant collateral would affect such collateral, i.e., it would be considered as new collateral and therefore would have the priority as of the day of inscription of such alteration in the Pledge Registry (thus giving rise to a new hardening period), and ranking lower than the collateral registered before the amendments. There is no consistency in the practice of the Serbian courts or the Pledge Registry as to which elements of the security documents should be considered essential elements, but these are generally considered to include the legal basis, principal amount, term and interest rate. Enforcement proceedings may be commenced in court or, if so expressly provided for in the pledge agreement (i.e., (Stakes) Pledge Agreement), out of court (in accordance with the terms and conditions imposed by the law). In case of judicial enforcement, the enforcement title is the relevant excerpt from the competent Pledge Registry and the stakes (i.e., share(s) in limited liability company) can be sold via public auction (direct sale is possible only if the collateral has a current market price, in the case of multiple failure of auction sale or in case the enforcement debtor and enforcement creditor agree so). When enforcement is pursued out of court (when this is permitted by the pledge agreement), the title for enforcement is the relevant excerpt from the Pledge Registry, the stakes can be sold at public auction and in direct sale only if its current market price can be established (unlikely to be the case with the stakes (i.e., share(s) in limited liability company). If the collateral does not have a current market price (as the stakes (i.e., share(s) in limited liability company)), the pledgee can sell it in a manner a reasonable and careful man taking care of the interests of the debtor (and the pledgor, if not the same party as the debtor) would employ.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

According to the Companies Act of FBiH, a limited liability company is prohibited from giving loans or providing securities/guarantees for the acquisition of its own shares. The scope of this prohibition of financial assistance is not entirely clear when it comes to its application to the company’s indirect shareholders or to the acquisition of shares of one the company’s direct or indirect shareholders. There are no precedents and therefore some risk remains that the courts could adopt an extensive interpretation of the provision. There is no explicit corporate benefit rule in the context of granting security for the obligations of third parties. However, under the general rules of the Companies Act of FBiH, the management is obliged to act in the company’s best interest and is liable for damages to the company and the shareholders in case of a breach of this duty. Upstream or cross stream guarantee/security may be potentially open to a challenge by way of an actio _pauliana. The rules on action pauliana, found in the Obligations Act, provide that a creditor having a due_ claim may file a lawsuit for avoidance of a transaction undertaken by its debtor, as far as the effects of that transaction on the creditor are concerned, if the transaction is deemed to be to the detriment of the challenging creditor, i.e. if as a result of such a transaction the debtor does not have enough assets to satisfy the creditor’s claim. The court practice concerning the foregoing in the context of third-party guarantees/security and corporate benefit, capital maintenance and financial assistance concepts is undeveloped in FBiH. Theoretically, a third-party guarantee/security given for no consideration can also be challenged for lack of causa (commercial reason underlying the transaction).",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

In addition, it should be noted that the Parallel Debt concept has not been tested under the laws of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Theoretically, the concept can be challenged as simulated contract or for lack of causa. However, a more compelling argument seems to be that if a Parallel Debt concept is enforceable under the law governing the financing documentation, there is no public policy norm of FBiH law that should be able to override this. In Bosnia and Herzegovina there is no comparable structure to the common law trust, due to the principle of accessority where a security may only be validly created in favour of the creditor(s) holding the secured claims The issue is typically solved through the appointment of a security agent, acting as a joint and several creditor (solidarni povjerilac) of each and every obligation of the borrower towards each creditor and/or by employing a Parallel Debt concept. However, the respective structures have not yet been tested before Bosnia and Herzegovina courts, although they are commonly used in cross-border financings. _Pledge Registry Software Platform Deficiencies_ The software of the Pledge Registry does not technically enable pledge registration with the pledgor being a foreign (i.e., non-Bosnian) entity. The web platform for pledge registration technically allows only a Bosnian domiciled pledgor to be recorded. The perfection (i.e., registration) of a share pledge over a Bosnian company’s shares by a non-resident shareholder is therefore practically unavailable and may only be effected with the intentional incorrect inscription of the country of origin of the pledgor (i.e., only by selecting the item “Bosnia and Herzegovina” from the dropdown menu). In practice the parties often opt to conclude the share pledge agreement in a form of notarial deed (notarski obrađena isprava) that constitutes an enforceable instrument (izvršna isprava). Even so, execution of the share pledge agreement in the form of a notarial deed does not constitute the pledge over the shares of the company, but only a pledge in respect of the enforceable deed. In an insolvency scenario, this would mean that such a creditor would not qualify as a secured creditor (razlučni povjerilac).",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

The parties have a right to appeal the court’s decision on the objection within eight days from its receipt, under certain circumstances enumerated in the law.

This pre-insolvency currently exists in addition to the traditional restructuring process and as a part of the insolvency procedure, and similarly to the insolvency procedure, its main steps must be sanctioned by a court. The pre-insolvency procedure under the Insolvency Act may be applied when there is a “threatening illiquidity” (prijeteća platežna nesposobnost), but where the debtor is still not insolvent. The threatening illiquidity is defined as a forecast that the debtor will not be able to satisfy its debt in accordance with its due repayment plan in the following 12 months or if the debtor is in a 60-days default with respect to the fulfillment of its monetary obligations. The debtor or the creditor (with the debtor’s consent) can file an application for the initiation of insolvency proceedings on this ground. Additionally, there are two main reasons for initiating insolvency proceedings—insolvency and threatened insolvency. In general, a debtor is insolvent if (a) it is unable to settle its due obligations for a period of 60 consecutive days, or (b) its bank accounts are blocked for a period of 60 consecutive days. ----- Insolvency proceedings are initiated upon a written petition of an authorized person. Authorized persons include the debtor and all creditors who have a legally recognized interest in the conduct of the proceedings. The creditor is required to demonstrate, by attaching appropriate documentation, that its claim and the inability of the debtor to make payments is probable. Only the insolvency debtor is entitled to initiate insolvency proceedings due to threatened insolvency. Insolvency proceedings are generally conducted in two phases, a preliminary phase and the insolvency proceedings themselves. The preliminary procedure is conducted by the insolvency court, which can also appoint an interim insolvency administrator. The main purpose of the preliminary procedure is to determine in principle whether the conditions for the opening insolvency are satisfied, i.e. whether any of the insolvency grounds exist, whether there is a sufficient basis for the petition, whether there are sufficient funds to cover the costs of the insolvency proceedings and whether the current operations can be maintained and continued without detriment to the debtor, potential insolvency estate and/or creditors. The insolvency proceedings, once opened, are conducted by the insolvency administrator appointed by the court and insolvency judge. An alternative to these two-step proceedings is direct bankruptcy, in cases where (i) a petition is filed by the company’s liquidator or (ii) a creditor files an insolvency petition supported by a final and binding decision on enforcement that is not satisfied for a period of at least 90 days. The general effects of the opening of insolvency proceedings include a stay of pending court and arbitral proceedings involving the insolvency estate, and pro rata satisfaction of creditors upon sale of the debtor’s assets by the administrator, in accordance with their payment ranks. Creditors with a separate satisfaction right (mortgagees, pledgees, creditors to which the debtor transferred rights as security, creditors with retention rights) have payment priority in insolvency proceedings and have the right to separate settlement from the proceeds of the asset serving as collateral. Only the insolvency administrator is authorized to dispose of the debtor’s assets and any disposal by the insolvency debtor is without legal effect, except in the case of disposals to which general rules of legitimate reliance on land registers or other appropriate public registers apply. As of the date of the opening of insolvency proceedings, all bank accounts are closed and the insolvency administrator opens a new bank account onto which all insolvency debtor’s funds from the closed accounts are transferred. There is no provision ensuring that the pledge on closed bank accounts transfers onto the new bank account. Guarantees and other security for third-party debt provided within a certain period preceding the opening of the insolvency proceedings may be challenged if they can be considered as giving preference to certain creditors, as follows: - guarantees and security given within the period of 12 months prior to the submission of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if at that time the debtor was insolvent or the creditor knew of such insolvency or did not know due to gross negligence; - guarantees and security given after the submission of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings if the creditor knew of the debtor’s insolvency or the motion for the opening of the insolvency proceedings at the time or did not know due to gross negligence; - guarantees and security given in the 90-days preceding the petition or after the submission thereof; and - guarantees and security given within the six months preceding the petition for the opening of the insolvency proceedings if the debtor was insolvent at such time. If the creditor is a related party, the awareness of the debtor’s insolvency is presumed. In addition, loans granted in substitution to capital contributions are subordinated to all other claims during the insolvency proceedings. Capital replacing loans are defined as loans that are granted at a critical time for the company, when the company’s shareholders could have been reasonably expected to contribute capital to the company, rather than grant loans. This also includes other legally binding transactions that are economically equivalent to loan. Granting of security for the claim of a company’s shareholder for repayment of a loan (or an equivalent thereof) given at the time when capital contribution should have been provided is voidable if the transaction took place within five years immediately preceding the opening of insolvency proceedings or after the petition. A legally binding transaction settling the claim of a company’s shareholder for repayment of a loan or economically equivalent transaction is voidable if the transaction took place in the three years preceding the opening of proceedings or after the petition. It is unclear whether the loans which fall under this provision are ----- only those given by the direct shareholder or also include loans by indirect shareholders or affiliates controlled by (in)direct shareholders and there is no relevant court practice.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

The following are deemed payments in the ordinary course of business: (a) procurement of goods and services for ordinary business activities; (b) operational costs of business (energy, water and similar); (c) salaries of workers; (d) VAT, excise duties, social contributions and other taxes that have to be calculated and paid in accordance with the law; (e) costs related to procedures before public bodies; and (f) costs related to documentation needed for commencement and implementation of financial consolidation and restructuring activities. In addition, the Financial Dealings Act prescribes that a company cannot perform any activity that may damage creditors or put certain creditors into unfavorable position, in particular: - diverting cash payments or financial flows to other persons; - lending; - distributing dividends, profits or payment of profits in advance; - transferring rights to third parties, and especially to related companies; and - procuring automobiles or spare parts for such vehicles, payments for business entertainment, accommodation expenses and similar. Accordingly, a company affected by illiquidity cannot make payments under a guarantee while that situation is pending. In addition, pursuant to the Financial Dealings Act, companies are obliged to maintain capital adequacy. Capital inadequacy exists if as of the date of the relevant financial statements, losses, including losses carried forward from earlier financial years, amount to at least 1/2 of the registered capital. In case of capital inadequacy, the management of the company is obliged to implement measures intended for restoring capital adequacy within its competence, such as finding adequate sources of financing, as well as convening a shareholders assembly and proposing to shareholders to take measures within its competence (such as, e.g. reducing registered capital to cover losses).",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Accordingly, the following discussion is limited to the relevant laws and regulations applicable in FBiH. Pursuant to the Foreign Exchange Act of FBiH (“FBiH FX Act”), cross border payments from and to FBiH are permitted if made in accordance with that law. The FBiH FX Act and related bylaws refer only to the guarantees and security that a Bosnian resident grants for the debt of a non-resident to another non-resident only if granted under a so-called “credit transaction.”Credit transactions between residents and non-residents, according to the FBiH FX Act, comprise credits and loans, whereas “credit transactions” between nonresidents are not specified or separately defined. Transactions with debt and equity securities are a separate category under the FBiH FX Act. It is unlikely that the narrow definition of cross-border guarantees/security under the FBiH FX Act would be interpreted by the competent FBiH authority to mean that guarantee/ security in support of foreign debt originating under bonds could be regarded as prohibited or as contrary to public policy of FBiH, because the FBiH FX Act allows granting of guarantees/security in economically equivalent situations (loans between non-residents). Nonetheless, the issue has not been formally clarified by the competent FBiH authority. Any guarantee or other security granted by a FBiH resident in favor of a non-resident must be registered with the Ministry of Finance of FBiH. The registration application must be made (i) within 15-days from the decision on the issuance of the guarantee is passed by the relevant body of the guarantor if the underlying transaction is concluded between two non-resident entities, or (ii) within 15-days from the date of execution of the underlying transaction documents if concluded between a resident and a non-resident entity. If the underlying transaction is concluded between two non-residents, periodic reports on the status of the guarantee must be provided to the Ministry of Finance of FBiH. In addition, any company based in FBiH that issues a guarantee or provides other security to a non-resident must obtain from non-resident a security instrument that hedges the risk of the guarantee being called. The FBiH FX Act does not contain any further details regarding such a security instrument. Nonetheless, the counter-guarantee instrument is scrutinized by the Ministry of Finance of FBiH, which typically requests presentation of a proof of a liquid security instrument and employs wide discretion when assessing and approving counter-guarantees. The Ministry’s restrictive practice is continually evolving, and varies on a caseby-case basis. Pursuant to article 7(2) of the FBiH FX Act, a commercial bank is prohibited to perform a payment order and from wiring funds abroad if such payment or transfer is in violation of the law, subject to administrative fines. In this context, there is a theoretical risk that a local bank might reject making relevant payments outside Bosnia and Herzegovina without proof that the cross-border guarantee has been approved by the Ministry of Finance of FBiH. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Under Luxembourg law, the following types of proceedings (together referred to as insolvency proceedings) may be initiated against a company incorporated in Luxembourg having its centre of main interests (within the meaning of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation) or an establishment in Luxembourg (in the latter case assuming that the centre of main interests is located in a jurisdiction where the E.U. Insolvency Regulation is applicable): - bankruptcy proceedings (faillite), the opening of which may be requested by the company, by any of its creditors or by the courts ex officio. Following such a request, the Luxembourg courts having jurisdiction may open bankruptcy proceedings if a Luxembourg company: (i) is in a state of cessation of payments (cessation des paiements); and (ii) has lost its commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit). The main effect of such proceedings is the sale of the assets and allocation of the proceeds of such sale between creditors taking into account their rank of privilege, as well as the suspension of all measures of enforcement against the company, except, subject to certain limited exceptions (please see the below applicable provision of the Luxembourg law dated August 5, 2005 concerning financial collateral arrangements, as amended ----- (the “Financial Collateral Law 2005”)), for enforcement by secured creditors and the payment of the secured creditors in accordance with their rank upon realization of the assets. In addition, the managers or directors of a Luxembourg company that ceases its payments (i.e. is unable to pay its debts as they fall due with normal means of payment) must within a month of them having become aware of the company’s cessation of payments, file a petition for bankruptcy (faillite) with the court clerk of the district court of the company’s registered office. A law of December 19, 2020 (amended on June 30, 2021) has suspended this one month delay until December 31, 2021. If the managers or directors fail to comply with such provision they may be held (i) liable towards the company or any third parties on the basis of principles of managers’ / directors’liability for any loss suffered and (ii) criminally liable for simple bankruptcy (banqueroute simple) in accordance with article 574 of the Luxembourg commercial code. - controlled management proceedings (gestion contrôlée), the opening of which may only be requested by the company and not by its creditors and under which a Luxembourg court may order the provisional stay of enforcement of claims except for secured creditors (please see the below applicable provision of the Financial Collateral Law 2005); or - composition proceedings (concordat préventif de la faillite), the opening of which may only be requested by the company and not by its creditors directly. The Luxembourg court’s decision to admit a company to composition proceedings triggers a provisional stay on enforcement of claims by creditors except, among others, for secured creditors (please see the below applicable provisions of the Financial Collateral Law 2005). - In addition to these proceedings, your ability to receive payment on the New Notes may be affected by a decision of a Luxembourg court to grant a stay on payments (sursis de paiement) or to put a Luxembourg company into judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire). Judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of the public prosecutor against companies pursuing an activity violating criminal laws or that are in serious breach or violation of the Luxembourg commercial code or of the Law 1915. The management of such liquidation proceedings will generally follow similar rules as those applicable to Luxembourg bankruptcy proceedings. Liability of any of the Guarantors existing under the laws of Luxembourg in respect of the relevant Notes will, in the event of a liquidation of the company following bankruptcy or judicial liquidation proceedings, only rank after the cost of liquidation (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and any claims that are preferred under Luxembourg law. Preferential claims under Luxembourg law include, among others: - remuneration owed to employees (last six months’ wages amounting to a maximum of six times the minimum social salary); - employees’ contributions to social security; - certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg Revenue; - employer’s contribution to social security; - landlord, pledgor not under the Financial Collateral Law 2005; and - value added tax and other taxes and duties owed to Luxembourg Customs and Excise. Assets over which a security interest has been granted will in principle not be available for distribution to unsecured and unpreferred creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is realized). Favorable rules apply in relation to security interests of claims or financial instruments securing monetary claims (or claims for the delivery of financial instruments) pursuant to the Financial Collateral Law 2005. Article 20 of the Financial Collateral Law 2005 provides that Luxembourg law financial collateral arrangements (pledges, security assignments and repo agreements) over claims and financial instruments, as well as valuation and enforcement measures agreed upon by the parties are valid and enforceable even if entered into during the pre-bankruptcy preference period (période suspecte) against third parties, commissioners, receivers, liquidators and other similar persons notwithstanding the insolvency proceedings (save in the case of fraud). Article 24 of the Financial Collateral Law 2005 provides that foreign law security interests over claims or financial instruments granted by a Luxembourg pledgor will be valid and enforceable as a matter of Luxembourg law notwithstanding any Luxembourg insolvency proceedings, if such foreign law security interests are similar in nature to a Luxembourg security interest falling within the scope of the Financial Collateral Law 2005. If article 24 applies, Luxembourg preference period rules are disapplied (save the case of fraud). ----- Article 21(2) of the Financial Collateral Law 2005 provides that where a financial collateral arrangement has been entered into after the opening of liquidation proceedings or the coming into force of reorganization measures or the entry into force of such measures, such arrangement is enforceable against third parties, administrators, insolvency receivers, liquidators and other similar persons if the collateral taker proves that it was unaware of the fact that such proceedings had been opened or that such measures had been taken or that it could not reasonably be aware of such proceedings, measures or arrangement.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Other than as described above, the ability of certain secured creditors to enforce their security interest may also be limited, in particular in the event of controlled management proceedings expressly providing that the rights of secured creditors are frozen until a final decision has been taken by a Luxembourg court as to the petition for controlled management, and may be affected thereafter by a reorganization order given by the court. A reorganization order requires the prior approval by more than 50% of the creditors representing more than 50% of any of the relevant Guarantor’s liabilities in order to take effect. Furthermore, you should note that declarations of default and subsequent acceleration (such as acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default) may not be enforceable during controlled management proceedings. However, during such controlled management proceedings a notice of default may still be served. Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by any of the relevant Guarantors incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg during the preference period (période suspecte) which is a maximum of six months preceding the judgment declaring bankruptcy, except that in certain specific situations the court may set the start of the suspect period at an earlier date. In particular: - pursuant to article 445 of the Luxembourg code of commerce (Code de commerce), specified transactions (such as, in particular, the granting of a security interest for antecedent debts save in respect of financial collateral arrangements within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Law 2005; payment of debts which have not fallen due, whether payment is made in cash or by way of assignment, sale, set-off or by any other means; the payment of debts which have fallen due by any means other than in cash or by bill of exchange; the sale of assets without consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration) entered into during the preference period (or the ten days preceding it) must be set aside or declared null and void, if so requested by the insolvency receiver; - pursuant to article 446 of the Luxembourg code of commerce, payments made for matured debts as well as other transactions concluded for consideration during the preference period are subject to cancellation by the court upon proceedings instituted by the insolvency receiver if they were concluded with the knowledge of the bankrupt party’s cessation of payments; and - pursuant to article 448 of the Luxembourg code of commerce and article 1167 of the Luxembourg civil code (action paulienne), the insolvency receiver (acting on behalf of the creditors) has the right to challenge any fraudulent payments and transactions, including the granting of security with an intent to defraud, made prior to the bankruptcy, without any time limit. In principle, a bankruptcy order rendered by a Luxembourg court does not result in the automatic termination of contracts except for employment agreements and powers of attorney. The contracts, therefore, subsist after the bankruptcy order. However, the bankruptcy receiver may choose to terminate certain contracts so as to avoid worsening the financial situation of the company. As of the date of adjudication of bankruptcy, no interest on any unsecured claim will accrue vis à vis the bankruptcy estate. Insolvency proceedings may hence have a material adverse effect on any of the relevant Guarantors’ business and assets and the relevant Guarantors’ respective obligations under the New Notes. Finally, international aspects of Luxembourg bankruptcy, controlled management or composition proceedings may be subject to the E.U. Insolvency Regulation. In particular, rights in rem over assets located in another jurisdiction where the E.U. Insolvency Regulation will not be affected by the opening of insolvency proceedings, without prejudice however to the applicability of rules relating to the voidness, voidability or unenforceability of legal acts detrimental to all the creditors (subject to the application of article 24 of the Financial Collateral Law 2005 as described above and article 16 of the E.U.

However, additional steps are required to enforce security interests against third parties. ----- If there are assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, the security interests over such assets will be governed by Luxembourg law and must be created, perfected and enforced in accordance with Luxembourg law. The Financial Collateral Law 2005 governs the creation, validity, perfection and enforcement of pledges over securities, bank account balances and receivables located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Security interests such as pledges, and transfer of ownership as a security, granted on financial instruments and claims are governed by the Financial Collateral Law 2005. Pursuant to such law, pledge is effected, not by transfer of title, but by a transfer of possession of the pledged assets to the pledgor or to a third-party acting as depository for the pledgor and the pledgor’s preference rights over the pledged assets only remain in existence as long as the pledgor or the depository remains in possession of such assets. A physical transfer of possession not being possible for intangibles such as monetary claims, the Financial Collateral Law 2005 provides for a fictitious transfer of possession which is effected by mechanisms which depend on the nature of the intangibles involved. In case of registered shares, the dispossession is achieved by the entry of the security interest in the share register of the relevant Luxembourg company. In case of claims, dispossession is effected as against the debtor and any third parties by the execution of the relevant pledge agreement. Nonetheless, the debtor of a pledged claim may validly discharge its obligation by performance rendered to the pledgor as long as it has no knowledge of the pledge. Dispossession of cash collateral is achieved by the security interest thereon being notified by the debtor and the acceptance thereof by the debtor of such claims. Absent perfection, the holder of the security interest may have difficulty enforcing his/its rights in the collateral with regard to third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same collateral. Finally, since the ranking of pledges is determined by the date on which they became enforceable against third parties, a security interest created on a later date over the same collateral, but which come into force for third parties earlier (by way of registration in the appropriate register or by notification) has priority.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

A company may give a guarantee provided the giving of the guarantee is covered by the company’s corporate purpose, corporate benefit and is in the best interest of the company. Although no statutory definition of corporate benefit (intérêt social) exists under Luxembourg law, corporate benefit is widely interpreted and includes any transactions from which the company derives a direct or indirect economic or commercial benefit in return (such as an economic or commercial benefit) and whether the benefit is proportionate to the burden of the assistance. It is generally held that within a group of companies, the corporate interest of each individual corporate entity can include, to a certain extent, the interest of the group, and that the existence of a group interest can in certain cases result in the guarantee being held enforceable even where corporate benefit is not established. In this way, reciprocal assistance from one group company to another does not necessarily conflict with the interest of the assisting company. However, this assistance must be temporary, in proportion to the real financial means of the assisting company (i.e., limited to an aggregate amount not exceeding the assisting company’s own funds (capitaux propres)), the company must receive some benefit or there must be a balance between the respective commitments of all the affiliates and the companies involved must form part of a genuine group operating under a common strategy aimed at a common objective. As a result, the guarantees/security interests granted by a Luxembourg company may be subject to limitations in order to ensure their enforceability. Further, a guarantee or security interest that substantially exceeds the guarantor’s or security provider’s ability to meet its obligations to the beneficiary of the guarantee/security provider and to its other creditors, or from which the Luxembourg company derives no or very limited direct benefit in return, or where no direct or indirect consideration is granted to the company in exchange, would expose its directors or managers to personal liability. In addition to any criminal and civil liability incurred by the directors or managers of the Luxembourg company, in extreme circumstances the guarantee or security interest could itself be held unenforceable, if it is held that it is contrary to public policy (ordre public), in the case of facts consisting of a misuse of corporate assets. Any guarantee granted in connection with the New Notes by Luxembourg companies may be limited to a certain percentage of, among others, the relevant company’s net worth. The Indenture provides for general limitation language to the effect that each guarantee granted therein and each security interest granted as well as any other obligation, liability or indemnification under a security document will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed/ secured by the relevant guarantor/security provider with respect to the aggregate obligations and exposure of the guarantor/security provider without rendering the relevant guarantee/security interest voidable or otherwise ineffective under Luxembourg and other applicable law.

The stabilization procedure under the Bulgarian Commerce Act may be applied when there is a “threat of insolvency” but where the debtor is still not insolvent. Actually, all court cases since the inception of the new procure have been focused on whether the requirements for launching stabilization were fulfilled and all publicly available judgments so far, the courts held that the debtor was actually insolvent (in most cases over-indebted), so insolvency rather than stabilization procedure had to be opened. We are not aware of any case where the new procedure was applied, and the debtor was successfully restructured to avoid insolvency. In terms of substance, the stabilization procedure provides for a temporary standstill where all court enforcement and out of court enforcement procedures (including those under special pledges) shall be stopped. Further there are rules for partial cram down of the debtor’s liabilities. As of the date of this offering memorandum, Bulgaria has not yet transposed Directive (EU) 2019/1023. Although a draft bill was published on the webpage of the Bulgarian government on February 26, 2021, the legislative implementation process that starts with a submission of a draft bill to the Bulgarian Parliament has not yet been commenced. In addition, since following the parliamentary elections in Bulgaria that took place on April 4, 2021, no government could be formed, new elections took place on July 11, 2021. The results of the new elections were similar to those held in April 2021 and therefore there is uncertainty on whether a government will be formed. As a result, there is a risk that the July 17, 2021 deadline for the implementation of Directive (EU) 2019/1023 in Bulgaria may not be met.

The insolvency proceedings do not affect out of court enforcement over Bulgarian special pledges, only if the out of court enforcement was commenced before launching of the insolvency proceedings. Otherwise the pledgee under a special pledge may only satisfy within the insolvency proceedings having a first-ranking priority over the insolvency proceeds from the collateral. A Bulgarian guarantor would be deemed insolvent in any of the following three cases occurs. The first case is one of balance sheet insolvency (over indebtedness). When a creditor claims that a debtor is balance sheet insolvent (as a ground for commencement of insolvency proceedings against the latter) it has to be established that the debtor’s “liabilities exceed his assets.” All liabilities must be compared to all assets for the purpose. This includes all existing liabilities including those that are not yet due (e.g. future payments under an existing contract). Contingent (conditional) liabilities however are not covered. There is no formal requirement that the negative balance for the purposes of over indebtedness should be substantial and though the dominating understanding among scholars is that minor negative balance should not be taken into account where the prospects for the entity are positive, it cannot be ruled out that even a minor negative balance may trigger over indebtedness. The second case is the one of cash flow insolvency. This means a state of inability to pay: (i) a monetary obligation under or in relation to a commercial transaction, or (ii) public law obligation towards the State/municipalities connected with the commercial activity of the entity; or (iii) private law obligation towards the State/municipalities. So, in the cash flow insolvency scenario a creditor must establish both: (i) the existence of a particular payment obligation of any of the three types listed above that was due but was not paid ----- (i.e.—the “First Condition”), and the inability of the debtor to pay (“Second Condition”). The First Condition involves establishment of only factual matters. The Second Condition however requires again a comparison between assets and liabilities of the debtor, although in a more limited manner (compared to the over indebtedness scenario). In particular (according to the case law) in order to determine whether a debtor is unable to pay, the ratio has to be established between the current/short-term assets (i.e. those that can be easily turned into cash) vis à vis short-term liabilities (i.e. existing liabilities with a maturity of up to 1 year in the future). If the ratio is below 1 (meaning that the short-term liabilities exceed the short-term assets), it is normally presumed that the debtor is unable to pay (i.e. the Second Condition is met). The third case where insolvency proceedings should be opened is the one of “concealed insolvency.” This means that an entity is concealing commercial activity behind an insolvent entity, so if that is proven to be case insolvency proceedings must be opened against the former. In general, the opening of insolvency proceedings by a Bulgarian court does not result in the automatic termination of contracts. However, the insolvency administrator may choose to terminate certain contracts as to avoid the worsening of the financial condition of the company. Any power of attorney terminates upon initiation of bankruptcy proceedings provided that the insolvency court has established that the debtor jeopardizes the interests of creditors and that the debtor has been deprived of the right to manage and dispose of the property of the company.

The general claim that creditors may take recourse to, even if there is no insolvency is Actio Pauliana (павлов иск) under art. 135 of the Obligations and Contracts Act. Under that claim a creditor may request that any act of the Bulgarian guarantor/security provider having a detrimental effect on the creditor be declared void as against the creditor, provided that the Bulgarian guarantor/security provider knew about that detrimental effect at the time of performing the act. In the context of non-gratuitous acts, the plaintiff (creditor) must furthermore prove that counterparty (creditor) to the Bulgarian guarantor/security provider also knew about the detrimental effect of the challenged act on other creditors. This means proof that both the Bulgarian guarantor/security provider and its counterparty knew there were other creditors having valid claims existing before the challenged act and the act in question was detrimental to them. Pure knowledge is sufficient, it is not necessary to prove that there was intention to inflict detrimental effect on the other creditors. However, if the parties intend to defraud the other creditors it is not necessary as a prerequisite for the Actio Pauliana that the respective creditor’s claim should have arisen before the challenged act. The detrimental effect for the purposes of Actio Pauliana exists if the possibility for the creditor to satisfy himself from the Bulgarian guarantor/security provider’s property is reduced, which means that via the challenged act created or increased its state of inability to pay to other creditors. In addition (subject to some technical exceptions) the following acts and transactions may be declared null and void with respect to the insolvency creditors if made by the Bulgarian guarantor/security provider after the initial date of insolvency or over indebtedness and cumulatively—within the timelines—under the following items (i) (iii) before the submission of the application for opening of insolvency proceedings: (i) performance of a monetary obligation that was not yet due (неизискуемо) regardless of the manner of performance made within a one year period; (ii) performance of a monetary obligation that was due (изискуемо) regardless of the manner of performance made within a six month period; and (iii) establishing a pledge, mortgage or personal security (i.e. a guarantee) to secure a previously not secured obligation made within a two year period. In addition to other general statutory rules providing for setting aside of certain acts and transactions, the following acts and transactions carried out by the debtor (within the timeline under items 1 3 below) before the submission of the application for opening of insolvency proceedings may be set aside with respect to the insolvency creditors: (i) establishment of a mortgage, pledge or personal security for another person’s debts, effected within one year, but not earlier than the date of the insolvency or over indebtedness, as the case may be; (ii) establishment of a mortgage, pledge or personal security for another person’s debts to the benefit of a creditor, which is a related party to the debtor, effected within two years; (iii) a transaction that is detrimental to the creditors, a party to which is a person related to the debtor, effected within two years; (iv) a transaction where the consideration provided by the insolvent Bulgarian guarantor/security provider exceeds significantly the consideration granted by its counterparty, effected within 2 years period before the submission of the application for opening of insolvency proceedings but not earlier than the date when the Bulgarian guarantor/ ----- security provider was in a state of inability to pay or over indebtedness; (v) gratuitous transaction made within a two year period (resp. three years if made to a related person).

The following enforcement mechanisms are possible: (i) court execution over dematerialized shares in a joint stock company (and sale) pursuant to the statutory provisions on execution and securing of claims (for which a prior writ of execution is required); and (ii) out of court execution over dematerialized shares in a joint stock company or shares (quotas) in a limited liability company through a private sale, pursuant to the currently ----- effective legislation and as of January 2022 (unless extensions are introduced), are required to be carried out under rules involving greater transparency and publicity than the existing rules, whereas the choice between court or out of court execution is at the sole discretion of the pledgor. Regarding collateral enforcement in this section only out of court enforcement of non-possessory special pledges (over going concerns, shares in limited liability companies and joint stock companies) under Bulgarian law will be considered. The term “out of court” refers to an extra judicial summary procedure for the seizure and sale of the collateral (i.e., a procedure without court involvement), pursuant to the rules set out in the Bulgarian Special Pledges Act. Under the Bulgarian Special Pledges Act, such out of court enforcement (i) does not require a prior Bulgarian, or any other court judgment, arbitral award, writ of execution or other judicial ruling; (ii) may be undertaken without acceleration of the New Notes for the amount outstanding and payable under the New Notes at the date of enforcement; and (iii) may be carried out simultaneously, independently and irrespective of any insolvency proceedings that may be opened with respect to the Bulgarian guarantor/security provider. This out of court Collateral enforcement is in effect a “fast track” recovery procedure irrespective of any other pending or contemplated actions or litigation proceedings. The enforcement starts with a notification of the commencement of out of court pledge enforcement to the Bulgarian Central Register of Special Pledges or another register depending on the type of collateral by the Trustee, on behalf and at the direction of holders of the New Notes. This does not require the assistance or the consent of the respective Bulgarian pledgor. The Trustee shall notify the respective pledgor of the commencement of the out of court enforcement proceeding, specifying, amongst other information, the nature of the default, the outstanding amount due and payable, and the collateral subject to sale. This notification may be served on the pledgee immediately following the notification to the respective register. Upon service of the above-mentioned notifications to the register and the applicable pledgor the Trustee is entitled to take possession of the Collateral that is the subject of enforcement. In the event the pledgor refuses to voluntarily surrender such Collateral, the Trustee may seek the intervention of and engage a bailiff (public or private enforcement officer) at the expense of the pledgor. On the basis of a certificate from the register confirming that enforcement has been initiated, such bailiff is entitled to force the pledgor to surrender the collateral, with police assistance, as necessary. The collateral sale may occur after expiry of a 2 week grace period from the notification to the register, to enable making voluntary payment before the collateral is sold. During this grace period, the Trustee may nevertheless organize the collateral sale (take possession of the collateral, engage the depository (as defined below), identify creditors, and so on). The collateral sale must be undertaken by and in the name of the Trustee. The Trustee must make reasonable efforts to achieve the best price for the collateral and there are some specific requirements to publicize the terms of the sale in advance by registration with the register. The Trustee may engage the pledgee, assuming it is cooperative, as its agent to manage the actual collateral sale process. The Trustee shall appoint a professional accountant or a bailiff (the “Depository”) who will administer the proceeds collected from the collateral sale. Amongst other things, the Depository shall (i) identify the creditors who have rights to the collateral that is subject to enforcement (“Qualified Creditors”) and notify the Qualified Creditors, who have two weeks to comment, after which the definitive list of Qualified Creditors is finalized and is not subject to challenge, (ii) open a special purpose depository bank account in the name of the Depository for the collection of sale proceeds, (iii) provide information on the contemplated distribution of proceed to the creditor(s) (which will be only the Trustee as creditor on behalf of the Bondholders), and (iv) if there are no objections or challenges, distribute such proceeds to the creditors (which will be only the Trustee as creditor on behalf of the Bondholders).",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

In particular, the general possibility under the Bulgarian Special Pledges Act to sell the pledged property out of court is inapplicable when it comes to enforcement over shares in a limited liability company.

Thus, even if a guarantee is valid under the applicable law, the Vivacom SSN Guarantors may oppose its validity based on certain Bulgarian law principles claiming that they are rules of overriding nature that should be applied regardless of the foreign applicable law. Although the overriding nature of the local rules has been confirmed by court practice with regard to certain of the limitations set forth below, there is no conclusive case law evidencing that the remaining rules would not be considered as overriding mandatory rules and/or rules of public policy. Such rules are as follows: (i) a guarantee will terminate upon novation (including by way of change of the parties or replacement of the debt) or transfer of the guaranteed debt, unless the relevant Bulgarian guarantor expressly agrees that the guarantee extends to the novated or transferred obligations; (ii) a Bulgarian guarantor will not be liable for any increased amount of the guaranteed debt, unless it has expressly agreed to such liability, and the extension of maturity of the guaranteed debt in relation to the debtor is not effective in relation to the Bulgarian guarantor, unless the Bulgarian guarantor has expressly agreed to such extension; (iii) a Bulgarian guarantor will not remain liable under the guarantee after the due date for repayment of the debt, unless the creditor has claimed repayment from the principal debtor within six months as of that repayment date; and (iv) since under Bulgarian law a guarantee would be considered as an accessory personal security, the waiver of the right to refer to the personal defenses of the respective debtor as well as to the set-off right of the respective debtor may not be enforceable under mandatory Bulgarian law and therefore the Bulgarian guarantor can avail itself of such personal defenses and set-off rights.

None of the directors of the Issuer or the Dutch Guarantors reside in the United States and a substantial amount of the Issuer’s assets, and a substantial amount of the assets of the Dutch Guarantors are located outside of the United States. Civil liabilities based on the securities laws of the United States may not be enforceable in the Netherlands, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. courts. The United States and the Netherlands currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by any court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. securities laws, would not be enforceable in the Netherlands. In order to obtain a judgment which is enforceable in the Netherlands, the claim must be re litigated before a competent Dutch court. A Dutch court will, under current practice, generally confirm a final, conclusive and enforceable U.S. judgement without substantive re-examination or re litigation on the merits if (a) that judgment results from proceedings compatible with the Dutch concept of due process, (b) that judgment does not contravene public policy (openbare orde) of the Netherlands, (c) the jurisdiction of the court has been based on an internationally acceptable ground,(d) the judgment by the court is not incompatible with a judgment rendered between the same parties by a Dutch court, or with an earlier judgment rendered between the same parties by a non-Dutch court in a dispute that concerns the same subject and is based on the same cause, provided that the earlier judgment qualifies for recognition in the Netherlands and (e) the judgment is—according to the laws of the country of origin—formally capable of being enforced (e.g. is readily enforceable, has not been annulled in appeal or its enforceability has not been subjected to a certain timeframe). Subject to the foregoing and provided that service of process occurs in accordance with applicable treaties, investors may be able to enforce in the Netherlands, judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, no assurance can be given that such judgments will be enforceable. In addition, it is doubtful whether a Dutch court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action commenced in the Netherlands and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. Any enforcement of agreements governed by foreign law and any foreign judgments in the Netherlands will be subject to the rules of Dutch civil procedure. Judgments may be rendered in a foreign currency but enforcement is executed in EUR at the applicable rate of exchange. Enforcement of obligations in the Netherlands will be subject to the nature of the remedies available in the courts of the Netherlands. Under certain circumstances, a Dutch court has the power to stay proceedings (aanhouden) or to declare that it has no jurisdiction, if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere. A Dutch court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses and damages.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Therefore, an enforceable judgment for the payment of monies rendered by a U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability would not be directly enforceable in Slovenia. However, a valid and legally binding judgment from a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States may be recognized and enforced by a court of ----- competent jurisdiction in Slovenia, subject to compliance with the enforcement procedures set forth in Articles 94 et seq. of the Slovenian Private International Law and Procedure Act (Zakon o mednarodnem _zasebnem pravu in postopku). Following such recognition, judgments of non-Slovenian courts have the same_ status and legal effect as those issued by Slovenian courts. The Slovenian courts will recognize a U.S. judgment if the judgment is legally binding in the United States and provided that all of the following conditions are met: - the matter does not fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of a Slovenian court; - the jurisdiction of the U.S. court was not based solely on the citizenship of the plaintiff, the property of the defendant in the United States or personal service of the claim to the defendant; - the U.S. court did not ignore the parties’ agreement on jurisdiction of Slovenian court; - a Slovenian court has not issued a legally binding decision on the same matter and no other foreign court decision has been recognized in Slovenia (res iudicata) (and in case of lis pendens the recognition process is on hold); - the recognition of the U.S. judgment would not contravene the public policy of Slovenia (ordre public); - reciprocity is established (reciprocity is presumed unless proven otherwise; additionally, absence of reciprocity is irrelevant when recognition or enforcement of a decision by a foreign court is sought by a Slovenian citizen); and - there were no procedural irregularities in the proceedings before the U.S. court that prevented the party against which the judgment was issued to take part in the procedure (no breach of due process rights). Subject to the above conditions, Slovenian courts will not review the merits of the foreign judgment. Slovenian courts also do not review whether the foreign court has acted in accordance with its own procedural laws— any such issues have to be resolved through an appeal process in that foreign jurisdiction. The request for recognition of a U.S. judgment must include the original judgment or a certified copy, a certificate of finality of the judgment, and a certified translation of the judgment. If, upon recognition of a U.S. judgment in Slovenia, an opposing party does not pay its debt voluntarily, a request for enforcement of the judgment must be made. This request must include a certificate of enforceability of the judgment under the applicable U.S. law. The international competence of courts and the recognition and enforcement of judgments of competent courts of a EU Member State (other than Slovenia) are governed by Council Regulation (EC) No. 1215/2012 of 12 December 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. In accordance with this regulation, if a court or competent authority so requires in connection with the recognition and the enforcement of a foreign judgment, a translation of the relevant documents must be produced and the translation must be certified by a person qualified to do so in one of the member states. A judgment may not be recognized if its recognition is manifestly contrary to public policy in the Member State in which recognition is sought; where it was given in default of appearance, if the defendant was not served with the document which instituted the proceedings or with an equivalent document in sufficient time and in such a way as to enable him to arrange for his defense, unless the defendant failed to commence proceedings to challenge the judgment when it was possible for him to do so; if it is irreconcilable with a judgment given in a dispute between the same parties in the Member State in which recognition is sought; if it is irreconcilable with an earlier judgment given in another Member State or in a third state involving the same cause of action and between the same parties, provided that the earlier judgment fulfills the conditions necessary for its recognition in the Member State addressed; or if it conflicts with Section 6 of Chapter II of the regulation dealing with exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Member States. Under no circumstances may a foreign judgment be reviewed as to its substance. In the event of any proceedings being brought in a Slovenian court in respect of a monetary obligation expressed to be payable in a currency other than euro, a Slovenian court would have power to give judgment expressed as an order to pay a currency other than euro.

From a procedural perspective, a foreign court judgment may be recognized (and further enforced) in Serbia as part of a separate recognition procedure or as a preliminary question in the regular enforcement proceedings. Reciprocity is presumed until proven otherwise, and de facto reciprocity is sufficient. However, enforceability of judgments of U.S. courts in Serbia cannot be confirmed. Serbia is not a party to any multilateral or bilateral treaty pursuant to which the judgments of U.S. courts would be recognized and enforced, and it appears that there are no cases that have established the principle of “factual reciprocity.” Serbia is not a party to any multilateral or bilateral treaty pursuant to which the judgments of U.K. courts would be recognized and enforced.

Furthermore, a substantial portion of the assets of each of the Guarantors incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg is located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon the relevant Guarantors, or to enforce against any of them judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws. We have been advised by our Luxembourg counsel that the United States and Luxembourg are not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. According to such counsel, an enforceable judgment for the payment of monies rendered by any U.S. Federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the U.S. securities laws, would not directly be enforceable in Luxembourg. However, a party who received such favorable judgment in a U.S. court may initiate enforcement proceedings in Luxembourg (exequatur) by requesting enforcement of the U.S. judgment by the District Court (Tribunal _d’Arrondissement) pursuant to Section 678 of the New Luxembourg Code of Civil Procedure. The District_ Court will authorize the enforcement in Luxembourg of the U.S. judgment if it is satisfied that all of the following conditions are met: - the U.S. judgment is final and enforceable (“exécutoire”) in the United States; - the U.S. court awarding the judgment must have had jurisdiction to adjudicate the respective matter both under applicable U.S. Federal or state jurisdictions rules, and under applicable Luxembourg international private law conflict of jurisdiction rules and local law; - the U.S. court has applied the substantive law as designated by Luxembourg conflict of laws rules, or at least, the order must not contravene the principles underlying those rules; - the U.S. judgment does not contravene international public policy or order as understood under the laws of Luxembourg or has not been given in proceedings of a tax, penal or criminal nature (which would include awards of damages made under civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws, or other laws, to the extent that the same would be classified by Luxembourg courts as being of a penal or punitive nature (for example, fines or punitive damages)). Ordinarily an award of monetary damages would not be considered as a penalty, but if the monetary damages include punitive damages, such punitive damages may be considered as a penalty; - the U.S. court has acted in accordance with its own procedural laws; - the judgment rendered by the U.S. court submitted to Luxembourg exequatur proceedings does not contradict a judgment which has been rendered in the forum of the Luxembourg courts; - the principles of fair trial and due process have been complied with and in particular the U.S. judgment was granted following proceedings where the counterparty had the opportunity to appear, and if it appeared, to present a defense; and - the U.S. judgment was not granted pursuant to an evasion of Luxembourg law (“fraude à la loi _luxembourgeoise”)._ Subject to the above conditions, Luxembourg courts tend not to review the merits of a foreign judgment, although there is no statutory prohibition. We have also been advised by our Luxembourg counsel that if an original action is brought in Luxembourg, Luxembourg courts may refuse to apply the designated law (i) if the choice of such law was not made bona fide and (ii) if its application contravenes Luxembourg public policy or is manifestly incompatible with Luxembourg international policy rules.

However, a valid and legally binding judgment from a New York court may arguably be recognized and enforced by a Bulgarian court under the general recognition and enforcement rules of the Bulgarian Private International Law Code. The rules under the Bulgarian Private International Law Code verbatim do not restrict the choice of court arrangements to those of EU member states so it is arguable that choice of the courts of non-EU member states are covered. However, an exclusive jurisdiction clause in favor of New York courts may be unenforceable in Bulgaria due to art. 4, par. 1 of the Brussels Regulation (Recast) which provides that “subject to this Regulation, persons domiciled in a Member State shall, whatever their nationality, be sued in the courts of that Member State.” This rule may be interpreted as not permitting choice of courts arrangements different from those under the Brussels Regulation (Recast) as EU Regulations are deemed to override any EU member state national laws. We are not aware of any Bulgarian case law or case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union that sheds light on how choice of New York courts arrangements should be treated. If and as soon as the Hague Convention of 30 June 2005 on Choice of Court Agreements (which has been ratified by the EU) will have been ratified by the United States (which is a signatory of this convention), this may change. Subject to the above qualification, if it is accepted that the Brussels Regulation (Recast) is not an obstacle to the application of the Bulgarian Private International Law Code, a New York court judgement may be recognized and enforced if the following conditions are met: (i) the New York court had jurisdiction according to the provisions of Bulgarian law, but not if the only ground for the jurisdiction of the New York court over the dispute was the incorporation (nationality) of the plaintiff in the jurisdiction of the seized court; (ii) a copy of the statement of claim was served on the defendant, the parties were duly summonsed, and the fundamental procedural principles of Bulgarian law, related to their defense have not been violated; (iii) there is no Bulgarian court judgment in force based on the same facts, involving the same cause of action and between the same parties; (iv) there are no pending proceedings based on the same facts, involving the same cause of action and between the same parties before a Bulgarian court, which has been brought earlier than the case instituted before the New York court on which there is judgement whose recognition/enforcement is being sought; (v) the recognition or enforcement is not contrary to Bulgarian public policy. Regarding the first requirement for recognition/enforcement as listed above, i.e., competence of the New York court under Bulgarian law, there is an express choice of court rule in the Private International Law Code (applicable also to a choice of court in favor of non-EU member states) whereby the parties may choose via agreement in writing a foreign (non-Bulgarian) jurisdiction in relation to proprietary matters provided that the dispute does not fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Bulgarian courts. As the Brussels Regulation (Recast) takes precedence over Bulgarian domestic private international law, a choice in favor of New Your courts must furthermore not violate the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of other member states if the prerequisites for such exclusive jurisdiction exist under the EU Brussels Regulation (Recast). The action for enforcement of a New York judgment must be brought before the Sofia City Court. Alongside the statement of claim (i.e. the request for recognition and enforcement), the following documents must be presented: (i) a certified copy of the judgment, authenticated by the New York court, and (ii) a certificate issued by the New York court, confirming that said judgment has entered into force. ----- These documents must be certified in accordance with the Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalisation for Foreign Public Documents (i.e. the Apostille Convention) and translated into Bulgarian by a translator certified by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Bulgaria. The Sofia City Court must of its own motion establish the existence of the conditions for recognition/ enforcement listed above. The defendant in the proceedings for recognition or enforcement of a New York judgement may not invoke violations of item (ii) of the list above if the defendant could have raised challenges to such conditions before the New York court but failed to do so. In the recognition/enforcement proceedings, the Bulgarian court would not examine the merits of the dispute as decided by the New York court. The debtor may in the recognition/enforcement proceedings raise the defense that the obligation has been extinguished on the basis of circumstances that have occurred after the New York judgement entered into force. The debtor however may not raise the defense that the obligation has been extinguished as per the preceding sentence if the Bulgarian judgment admitting enforcement has entered into force. The judgment of the Sofia City Court in relation to the recognition of a New York court judgment is subject to appeal before the Sofia Court of Appeals. The decision of the Sofia Court of Appeals is subject to appeal before the Supreme Court of Cassation. The cassation procedure is conditional on the prior admission for appeal and the party challenging the appellate judgment should provide evidence that the statutory grounds for cassation are satisfied. The Supreme Court of Cassation grants the appellant a leave to appeal before considering the cassation appeal on its merits. The cassation appeal to the Supreme Court of Cassation does not suspend execution of the judgment of the appellate court. Thus, the judgment of the Sofia Court of Appeals shall be enforceable and a party may initiate enforcement proceedings immediately after the judgment of the appellate court. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

GROUP NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) In thousands of EUR unless otherwise stated 2.** **Basis of preparation (continued),1134.34.1,,"The expansion of the Group is based on a leveraged buyout strategy resulting in an increased finance debt and the associated net finance expenses. The Group’s key performance indicators are Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) (see note 5 for definition). Adjusted EBITDA for the three-month period ended 31 March 2021 has increased by 129% comparing to the same period for the 2020. Significant increase in Adjusted EBITDA mainly is result of acquired companies (notes 15, 21). The Group regularly (daily and monthly) analyses liquidity projections, internal financial reports, availability of financial assets and ability to repay its liabilities through daily and/or monthly review of budgeted and actual cash flows and monitoring of maturity of the Group’s receivables and liabilities. Primary sources of the Group’s liquidity and funds for capital expenditures, acquisitions and other investments have been operating cash flows, revolving credit facilities, ancillary lending facilities and leases. The Group has reported net cash inflow from operating activities in the amount of EUR 94,018 thousand for the three-month period ended 31 March 2021. The Group was able to repay its obligations when they fell due in the normal course of business with no defaults in repayment of debt, the associated financial interest expenses nor any other liabilities. As at 31 March 2021, the Group has outstanding loans in the amount of EUR 82,903 thousand and bond liabilities (including interest) in the amount of EUR 3,288,932 thousand which matures from 2024 to 2028. In February 2020, the Group issued bonds in the amount of EUR 1,675,000 thousand for the purpose of acquisition of BTC Group as well as early repayment of one bond tranche and repayment part of the RCF. These bonds issuance is with maturity date in 2026 and 2028 (note 31). In November 2020, additional bonds were issued in the amount of EUR 400 million with maturity in 2027 and in January 2021 additional EUR 150 million with the same maturity. As at 31 March 2021 the Group has an undrawn revolving credit line in the amount of EUR 283,488 thousand (31 December 2020: EUR 353,422 thousand) (note 31). According to the Group’s business plan for 2021, the Group will continue to grow and expects increase in Adjusted EBITDA, which will provide sufficient ground for financing debt, capital expenditures and working capital. The following further forms the basis of management’s use of going concern: - The Group has grown its share of the telco and media market in the region. - The Group maintains a high level of business ethics and regulatory compliance and there is no indication of any foreseeable material adverse change in the regulatory landscape. - The Group is complied with the covenants related to the listed bonds and senior credit facilities as at 31 March 2021 and expects to remain compliant with these covenants over the duration of the forecast period (being for at least twelve months after the date of signing of the financial statements). See notes 4 and 31 for further details of the covenants. Based on the Group’s going concern assessment, the condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Group for the period ended 31 March 2021 are, therefore, prepared on a going concern basis, as management have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. **2.4.** **COVID-19** The existence of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was confirmed in early 2020 and has spread rapidly from mainland China across the globe, causing disruptions to businesses and economic activity and it continued to shape its course in 2021. Economic development over the coming months will depend on the spread of infection. Vaccines against COVID-19 became available in December 2020 which substantially reduce the probability of infection. ----- The impact of this outbreak on macroeconomic forecasts and markets are incorporated into the Group’s estimates of expected credit loss provisions for financial assets and other impairments assessments in 2021, including but not limited to: Goodwill, Property, plant and equipment, Intangible assets and Programming rights. Management has reasonable expectations that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The results of management review of the Group’s market, operations and financials in the past year and a forecast for at least twelve months after the date of signing of the financial statements provides a sound basis for the appropriateness of using the going concern assumption in the preparation of the Group’s financial statements for the period ended 31 March 2021, though the existence of Coronavirus (COVID-19) means there is generally a level of uncertainty in the wider macro market. Management concluded that the range of possible outcomes considered at arriving at this judgment does not give rise to material uncertainties related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern for at least twelve months from the date of authorization of the financial statements for issue. For sensitivity analysis on interest rate risk, please see note 3.3.3. - Disclosure of Accounting Policies—Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2(effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023). These standards are not expected to have a material impact on the Group in the current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

The Group recorded decrease of 4% in organic Adjusted EBITDA comparing to the same period 2020 mainly as a negative impact of COVID-19 to its Media segment. The Group’s telco segments have continued to meet customers’ expectations on service level and network operating centre has maintained normal service levels. No significant change in customer database is experienced during reporting period ended 31 March 2021. Negative effect of increase in bad debt and decline in revenue from sale of handsets and roaming was mainly offset with decline in churn rate due to limitation in direct sale to customers. At the same time, the Group has implemented cost savings measures such as: decrease in travelling, representation and consulting costs. In its Media segment (organic), external revenue decreased by 11% comparing to the same period previous year as certain contract for carriage fee were not prolonged (expired as Covid-19 crisis has begun) and currently are under further negotiations with customers, dominantly in Slovenia. This is the main reason for decline in Adjusted EBITDA comparing to three months period ended 31 March 2021. Revenues streams of media business which were mostly affected with the lockdown and state of emergency across the region, are expected to be at pre-COVID19 level by the end of 2021 and to continuous growth is expected afterwards.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

During 2021 further measures were applied by governments however, cash flow was stable during three months period ended 31 March 2021. As at the date of this report, there is no adverse impact on cash flow. Efforts have been made to keep collection of receivables at highest possible level which resulted in increased net impairment of trade receivables in comparison to the same period previous year 52% (e.g EUR 1.1 million), although the Group increased its revenue by 127% (e.g EUR 245 million) comparing to same period 2021. In February 2020 the Group issued bonds for the purpose of acquisition of VIVACOM Group and refinancing part of existing debt by which interest rates decreased and maturity was extended until 2028. In November 2020 and January 2021 issued bonds were issued for the purpose of repayment part of RCF as well as acquisition of Nova Broadcasting Group (see note 31).

The Group’s policy on liquidity is to maintain sufficient liquid resources to meet its obligations as they fall due, which has been achieved through appropriate bank arrangements (note 31). Typically, the Group seeks to ensure that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected current liabilities as they fall due, including the servicing of financial obligations; this excludes the potential impact of extreme circumstances that cannot reasonably be predicted, such as natural disasters. The Group has covenants relating to Revolving Credit Facility and bonds. Covenants relating to bonds are active only when the Group decides to issue new bonds or refinance old one.

Different entities within the Group have different functional currencies, based on the underlying economic conditions of their operations. Other than Euro, which is the Company’s functional currency, the Group’s subsidiaries have local functional currencies: Serbian dinar (“RSD”), Croatian kuna (“HRK”), Bosnian Konvertibilna marka (“BAM”), Bulgarian lev (“BGN”) and Swiss franc (“CHF”). The Bosnia Konvertibilna marka and Bulgarian lev are pegged to the Euro. Accordingly, the main exposure to currency risk comes from relates to purchases and borrowings which are denominated in Euros and US dollars, while a significant share of the Group’s revenue is denominated in Serbian dinars, Swiss franc and Croatian kuna. The Group has exposure to currency fluctuation (depreciation) of RSD (Serbian dinar) to Euro given that it has significant operations through SBB Serbia for which RSD is the functional currency and that has significant borrowings in Euro. The Group’s currency risk policy for this exposure is implemented through regular price adjustments on the Serbian market, following the depreciation of Serbian dinar against Euro. The following table presents sensitivities of profit or loss and equity to reasonably possible changes in exchange rates to EUR applied at the end of the reporting period relative to the functional currency of the respective Group entities, with all other variables held constant:",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

The best evidence of fair value is the price in an active market. An active market is one in which transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow models or models based on recent arm’s length transactions or consideration of financial data of the investees are used to measure fair value of certain financial instruments for which external market pricing information is not available. Fair value measurements are analysed by level in the fair value hierarchy as follows: - level one is measurements at quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, - level two measurements are valuations techniques with all material inputs observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices), and - level three measurements are valuations not based on solely observable market data (that is, the measurement requires significant unobservable inputs). Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are deemed to have occurred at the end of the reporting period. The table below shows the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities, including their levels in fair values hierarchy. It does not include information for financial assets and financial liabilities not measured at fair value if the carrying amount if reasonable approximation of fair value. The fair values of the Other financial liabilities—bonds are calculated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at 31 March 2021. The valuation basis is level 2. This classification comprises items where fair value is determined from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the liability, either directly or indirectly. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of this condensed consolidated interim financial information in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 – ‘Interim _financial reporting’ as adopted by the European Union. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion_ on this condensed consolidated interim financial information based on our review. _Scope of Review_ We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements 2410, ‘Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity’. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. _Conclusion_ Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 – ‘Interim financial reporting’ as adopted by the European Union. _Emphasis of Matter_ We draw attention to the note 2.1 which describes that these condensed consolidated financial statements have been reissued for a reason of correction of disclosure in the note 3.2. Our conclusion is not modified in respect of this matter. PricewaterhouseCoopers d.o.o.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Macasovic, Member; Banking Account: Raiffeisenbank Austria d.d., Magazinska 69, Zagreb, IBAN: HR8124840081105514875. ----- Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control. - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. - Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

Statement of compliance,1135.35.1,,"The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), as adopted by the European Union (EU). These consolidated financial statements are not statutory consolidated financial statements and they are prepared for the purpose of providing information to owners of the Group. IFRS requires the management to adopt accounting policies that are the most appropriate to the Group’s circumstances. These have been applied consistently to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. In 2020 the Group changed accounting policy for investment property. This change to significant accounting policies is described in note 3. Certain comparative amounts do not correspond to the 2019 consolidated financial statements and reflect reclassification adjustments made to conform to the current period presentation. Specifically, the following comparative balances as of 31 December 2019 were reclassified in the consolidated statement of financial position as of 31 December 2020: - Interest payable EUR 33,294 thousand (as of 31 December 2019 EUR 26,323 thousand) is now presented within line Interest payables—bond, whilst in consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2019 where it was presented in line Trade and other payables. - Impairment losses on trade and other receivables, including contract assets and Impairment losses on other financial assets are renamed in 2020 into Net impairment on trade and other receivables, including contract assets and Net impairment on other financial assets. The above change was considered by the Group as a change in accounting policy and in line with IAS 8 it was applied retrospectively, however due to the nature of the change, the statement of financial position was impacted, therefore presenting an additional statement of financial position is not considered to be relevant for the Group. The consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue by the Board of Directors on 22 April 2021. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

382_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1135,INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,1135.37,2.3. Going concern,1135.37.1,,"The Group has reported a net loss for the year ended 31 December 2020 in the amount of EUR 72,426 thousand (2019: EUR 60,036 thousand) which is mainly attributable to increase in finance cost due to additional bonds issued during 2020 which was used for the acquisition of VIVACOM Group as well as redemption of existing bond and partial repayment of revolving credit facility (see note 15). The Group has reported a net loss for the year ended 31 December 2019 in the amount of EUR 60,036 thousand which was influenced by several factors including, but not limited to: a share-based payment arrangement started in 2018 resulting in additional staff cost in the amount of EUR 21,659 thousand for 2019 and redemption fee option for early repayment of bond in the amount of EUR 12,578 thousand. The expansion of the Group is based on a leveraged buyout strategy resulting in an increased finance debt and the associated net finance expenses. The Group’s key performance indicators are Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) (see note 7 for definition). Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended 31 December 2020 has increased by 47% comparing to the same period for the 2019. Significant increase in Adjusted EBITDA mainly is result of acquired companies (notes 17, 23). The Group regularly (daily and monthly) analyses liquidity projections, internal financial reports, availability of financial assets and ability to repay its liabilities through daily and/or monthly review of budgeted and actual cash flows and monitoring of maturity of the Group’s receivables and liabilities. Primary sources of the Group’s liquidity and funds for capital expenditures, acquisitions and other investments have been operating cash flows, revolving credit facilities, ancillary lending facilities and leases. The Group has reported net cash inflow from operating activities in the amount of EUR 293,149 thousand for the year ended 31 December 2020. The Group was able to repay its obligations when they fell due in the normal course of business with no defaults in repayment of debt, the associated financial interest expenses nor any other liabilities. As at 31 December 2020, the Group has outstanding loans in the amount of EUR 2,158 thousand and bond liabilities (including interest) in the amount of EUR 3,151,735 thousand which matures from 2024 to 2028. In February 2020, the Group issued bonds in the amount of EUR 1,675 million for the purpose of acquisition of BTC Group as well as early repayment of one bond tranche and repayment part of the RCF. These bonds issuance is with maturity date in 2026 and 2028 (note 33). In November 2020, additional bonds were issued in the amount of EUR 400 million with maturity in 2027 and in January 2021 additional EUR 100 million with the same maturity. As at 31 December 2020 the Group has an undrawn revolving credit line in the amount of EUR 353,422 thousand (31 December 2019: EUR 153,246 thousand) (note 33). According to the Group’s business plan for 2021, the Group will continue to grow and expects increase in Adjusted EBITDA, which will provide sufficient ground for financing debt, capital expenditures and working capital. The following further forms the basis of management’s use of going concern: - The Group has grown its share of the telco and media market in the region. - The Group maintains a high level of business ethics and regulatory compliance and there is no indication of any foreseeable material adverse change in the regulatory landscape. - The Group is complied with the covenants related to the listed bonds and senior credit facilities as at 31 December 2020 and expects to remain compliant with these covenants over the duration of the forecast period (being for at least twelve months after the date of signing of the financial statements). See notes 5 and 33 for further details of the covenants. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,933
382_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1135,INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,1135.38,ADRIA MIDCO B.V. GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) In thousands of EUR unless otherwise stated 2.** **Basis of preparation (continued),1135.38.1,,"Based on the Group’s going concern assessment, the consolidated financial statements are, therefore, prepared on a going concern basis, as management have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. **2.4. COVID-19** The existence of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was confirmed in early 2020 and has spread rapidly from mainland China across the globe, causing disruptions to businesses and economic activity and it will continue to shape its course in 2021. Many governments across the world have imposed travel restrictions, lock downs and social distancing with a view to reducing the spread of the virus and hopefully minimizing the number of fatalities. Currently, the world is experiencing continued spread of COVID-19, further waves of infection. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affects business, results of operations and financial condition depends on several factors, such as the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, any additional periods of lockdown in the countries in which customers are located, and the pace at which demand, pricing and, in general, economic and operating conditions will stabilize and recover in the countries where the Group operate. Any future developments are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic. The main priority has been the health and safety of employees and continuous provision of service. The Group has adhered to instructions issued by the state authorities, including travel restrictions and enforced working from home. Management believes that the impact on business is currently limited with no immediate material adverse operational impact. Management intend to continue to follow the various national and/or state authorities’ policies and, in parallel, intend to do utmost to continue operations as the situation evolves. Whilst inherently uncertain, and the management expects some impact to operations and performance but currently does not believe that the COVID-19 outbreak will directly have a material adverse effect on the Group’s financial condition or liquidity for the foreseeable future such that it is not appropriate to apply the going concern principal to these financial statements. The impact of this outbreak on macroeconomic forecasts and markets are incorporated into the Group’s estimates of expected credit loss provisions for financial assets and other impairments assessments in 2020, including but not limited to: Goodwill, Property, plant and equipment, Intangible assets and Programming rights. Management has reasonable expectations that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The results of management review of the Group’s market, operations and financials in the past year and a forecast for at least twelve months after the date of signing of the financial statements provides a sound basis for the appropriateness of using the going concern assumption in the preparation of the Group’s financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2020, though the existence of Coronavirus (COVID-19) means there is generally a level of uncertainty in the wider macro market. Management concluded that the range of possible outcomes considered at arriving at this judgment does not give rise to material uncertainties related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern for at least twelve months from the date of authorization of the financial statements for issue. 2.4.1. Revenues and Adjusted EBITDA Negative impact to organic consolidated revenues in 2020 amounts to 1.5% comparing the year ended 31 December 2019. The Group recorded decrease of 2.6% in organic Adjusted EBITDA comparing to the same period 2019. The Group’s telco segments have continued to meet customers’ expectations on service level and network operating centre has maintained normal service levels. No significant change in customer database is ----- experienced in 2020. Negative effect of increase in bad debt and decline in revenue from sale of handsets and roaming was mainly offset with decline in churn rate due to limitation in direct sale to customers. At the same time, the Group has implemented cost savings measures such as: decrease in travelling, representation and consulting costs. In its Media segment, revenue decreased by 14% comparing to the same period previous year. Postponing of certain sports events effected by reduction of revenue and relevant costs by 9%. Decline in media selling revenue is offset by decline in relevant costs. All this combined by overall cost optimization efforts resulted in decrease of 7% in Adjusted EBITDA in Media segment compared to the year ended 31 December 2019. 2.4.2. Financing and liquidity The Group have sufficient cash reserves and cash generated for the forecast period to meet its financing obligations. Net working capital is regularly monitored at each component level. During 2020 some countries declared state of emergency and social distancing rules and store closures which had effect of cash collection in the first weeks of April. After the easing the measures in May, cash flow stabilised. As at the date of this report, there is no adverse impact on cash flow. Certain capex investments, except those necessary for maintaining regular operations, have been postponed. Efforts have been made to keep collection of receivables at highest possible level which resulted in increase of Net impairment of trade receivables for EUR 924 thousand in comparison to previous year, although the Group increased its revenue by 50% in 2020. In February 2020 the Group issued bonds for the purpose of acquisition of VIVACOM Group and refinancing part of existing debt by which interest rates decreased and maturity was extended until 2028. In November 2020 issued bonds were issued for the purpose of repayment part of RCF as well as acquisition of Nova Broadcasting Group (see notes 33, 40). Currently available credit lines amount to EUR 360 million with extended maturity to 2025 (see note 33). For sensitivity analysis on interest rate risk, please see note 4.3.3. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated to the functional currency at the exchange rate when the fair value was determined. Foreign currency differences are recognized in consolidated statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are not translated. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in profit or loss and presented within finance costs. Amortised cost is the amount at which the financial instrument was recognised at initial recognition less any principal repayments, plus accrued interest, and for financial assets less any allowance for expected credit losses. Accrued interest includes amortisation of transaction costs deferred at initial recognition and of any premium or discount to the maturity amount using the effective interest method. Accrued interest income and accrued interest expense, including both accrued coupon and amortised discount or premium (including fees deferred at origination, if any), are not presented separately and are included in the carrying values of the related items in the consolidated statement of financial position. whether the contractual cash flows are consistent with a basic lending arrangement, i.e. interest includes only consideration for credit risk, time value of money, other basic lending risks and profit margin. Where the contractual terms introduce exposure to risk or volatility that is inconsistent with a basic lending arrangement, the financial asset is classified and measured at fair value through profit and loss. The SPPI assessment is performed on initial recognition of an asset and it is not subsequently reassessed. Financial instruments are reclassified only when the business model for managing the portfolio as a whole change. The reclassification has a prospective effect and takes place from the beginning of the first reporting period that follows after the change in the business model. - Interest rate benchmark (IBOR) reform—phase 2 amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 (issued on 27 August 2020 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021).

Where the Group uses only insignificant portion of a property it owns for supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes (utilization of less than 25% is regarded as insignificant) the property is presented as an investment property. Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. The cost of replacing part of an existing investment property will be recognized in the carrying amount of an investment property at the time that cost is incurred if the recognition criteria are met. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are stated at fair value in the consolidated financial statements. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair values of investment properties are included in profit or loss in Other income/Other operating expense in the period in which they arise. An investment property is derecognized upon disposal or when the investment property is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits are expected from the disposal.

The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities. The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to maintain a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations. The finance function monitors compliance with the Group’s risk management policies and procedures, and provides top management with feedback regarding the performance of the framework in relation to the risk faced by the Group.

Impairment of other financial assets is presented in table below: The Group has covenants relating to Revolving Credit Facility and bonds. Covenants relating to bonds are active only when the Group decides to issue new bonds or refinance old one. Covenants relating to RCF are monitored regularly (note 33). The following are the undiscounted contractual maturities of financial liabilities: - level one are measurements at quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, - level two measurements are valuations techniques with all material inputs observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices), and - level three measurements are valuations not based on solely observable market data (that is, the measurement requires significant unobservable inputs). Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are deemed to have occurred at the end of the reporting period. The table below shows the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities, including their levels in fair values hierarchy. It does not include information for financial assets and financial liabilities not measured at fair value if the carrying amount if reasonable approximation of fair value. The fair values of the Other financial liabilities—bonds are calculated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at 31 December.

Credit risk,1135.60.1,,"Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers, contract assets, cash and cash equivalents held at banks, loans and financial guarantees issued by the Group and the indemnification asset. 4.1.1. Expected credit loss The Group has financial assets classified and measured at amortised cost and fair value through other comprehensive income that are subject to the expected credit loss model requirements of IFRS 9. Cash at bank and in hand and certain other investments are both classified and measured at amortised cost and subject to these impairment requirements. However, the identified expected credit loss is considered to be immaterial. The Group assesses, on a forward-looking basis, the expected credit loss for debt instruments measured at amortized cost and fair value through other comprehensive income and for the exposures arising from loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts, for contract assets. The Group measures expected credit loss and recognises net impairment losses on financial and contract assets at each reporting date. The measurement of expected credit loss reflects: - an unbiased and probability weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes, - time value of money and - all reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost and effort at the end of each reporting period about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future conditions. Debt instruments measured at amortized cost, trade and other receivables, loans issued and contract assets are presented in the consolidated statement of financial position net of the allowance for expected credit loss. The Group applies simplified approach for impairment of trade receivables without significant financing component and contract assets. For other financial assets the Group applies a three-stage model for impairment, based on changes in credit quality since initial recognition. A financial instrument that not had a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition or that have low credit risk at the reporting date is classified in Stage 1. Financial assets in Stage 1 have their expected credit loss measured at an amount equal to the portion of lifetime expected credit loss that results from default events possible within the next 12 months or until contractual maturity, if shorter (“12 Months expected credit loss”). If the Group identifies a significant increase in credit risk (“SICR”) since initial recognition, the asset is transferred to Stage 2 and its expected credit loss is measured based on expected credit loss on a lifetime basis, that is, up until contractual maturity but considering expected prepayments, if any (“Lifetime expected credit loss”). If the Group determines that a financial asset is credit-impaired, the asset is transferred to Stage 3 and its expected credit loss is measured as a Lifetime expected credit loss. For financial assets that are purchased or originated creditimpaired (“POCI Assets”), the expected credit loss is always measured as a Lifetime expected credit loss. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Trade and other receivables (including contract assets) The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The Group assesses that it has no significant concentration of credit risk due to its exposure to a broad customer base in each service line. No concentration of credit risk on a geographical basis is assessed as material. The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure for each customer including services disconnection procedure. Customer credit risk is managed by the Group’s business units which each have policies, procedures and controls relating to customer credit risk management. Outstanding trade receivables and contract assets are regularly reviewed to monitor any changes in credit risk with concentrations of credit risk considered to be limited given that the Group’s customer base is large and unrelated. The Group applies the simplified approach and records lifetime expected credit losses for trade receivables and contract assets. The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was: -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Under Other financial assets, the Group reported indemnification asset for acquisition of VIVACOM Group in the amount of EUR 49,237 thousand. Considering the fact that the full indemnification amount is deposited at banks, the expected credit loss in relation to this indemnification asset as at 31 December 2020 was assessed as being not material (note 28). 4.1.5. Short term loans and deposits A loss allowance in relation to short term loans and deposits is determined individually for each balance. In order to assess credit risk publicly available information to determine default rates. No exposure to any significant credit risk was identified, the calculation of the loss allowances resulted in immaterial amounts. 4.1.6. Cash and cash equivalents The Group holds cash in a number of banks in order to avoid concentration risk. A loss allowance in relation to cash and cash equivalents is determined individually for each balance with a given financial institution. In order to assess credit risk, external credit ratings and publicly available information on default rates for a given rating of Standard & Poor’s rating agency were used. As all cash balances have a low credit risk as at the reporting date and comparative period, the Group applied the practical expedient available under IFRS 9 and determined the loss allowances based on 12-month expected credit losses. The calculation of the loss allowances resulted in an immaterial amount. The Group held cash and cash equivalents of EUR 285,405 thousand as 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: EUR 250,058 thousand) with reputable local commercial banks, which represents its maximum credit exposure on these assets.

The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. The Group’s policy on liquidity is to maintain sufficient liquid resources to meet its obligations as they fall due, which has been achieved through appropriate bank arrangements (note 33). Typically, the Group seeks to ensure that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected current liabilities as they fall due, including the servicing of financial obligations; this excludes the potential impact of extreme circumstances that cannot reasonably be predicted, such as natural disasters. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Currency risk Currency risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognized assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency of the Group entity holding the asset or obligation. Different entities within the Group have different functional currencies, based on the underlying economic conditions of their operations. Other than Euro, which is the Company’s functional currency, the Group’s subsidiaries have local functional currencies: Serbian dinar (“RSD”), Croatian kuna (“HRK”), Bosnian Konvertibilna marka (“BAM”), Bulgarian lev (“BGN”) and Swiss franc (“CHF”). The Bosnia Konvertibilna marka and Bulgarian lev are pegged to the Euro. Accordingly, the main exposure to currency risk comes from relates to purchases and borrowings which are denominated in Euros and US dollars, while a significant share of the Group’s revenue is denominated in Serbian dinars, Swiss franc and Croatian kuna. The Group has exposure to currency fluctuation (depreciation) of RSD (Serbian dinar) to Euro given that it has significant operations through SBB Serbia for which RSD is the functional currency and that has significant borrowings in Euro. The Group’s currency risk policy for this exposure is implemented through regular price adjustments on the Serbian market, following the depreciation of Serbian dinar against Euro.

The Group’s performance management is focused on generating budgeted Adjusted EBITDA as well as maintaining overall liquidity position to repay the financial debt (note 4). An important key performance indicator for the communication with investors, analysts, and rating agencies is Pro Forma Net leverage (calculated as Adjusted Pro Forma Net Debt to Annualized Last Two Quarters Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA). “Annualised” amounts are calculated by multiplying the amounts for last two quarters by 2. This pro forma ratio stood at 4.7x at 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: 4.71x). Annualized Last Two Quarters Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Pro Forma Net Debt are nonGAAP figures not governed by International Financial Reporting Standards, and their definition and calculation may vary from one company to another.

Impairment testing requires management to judge whether the carrying value of assets can be supported by the net present value of future cash flows that they generate. Calculating the net present value of the future cash flows requires estimates to be made in respect of highly uncertain matters including management’s expectations of: - growth in Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in note 7), - timing and amount of future capital expenditure; - long-term growth rates; and - discount rates to reflect the risks involved. Management prepares formal five-year budget for the Group’s operations, which are used to estimate their value in use.

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the CODM. CODM is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments. Operating segments are components that engage in business activities that may earn revenues or incur expenses as a result of the services provided. Operating results of segments are regularly reviewed by the CODM and discrete financial information is available on that level. Revenue in telco segments is attributed to a country based on the location of the sub-group reporting the revenue. The functions of CODM are performed by the Managing directors of the Group. The Group has seven operating segments in telecom and one in media business line, which are the Group’s strategic divisions. Telecom strategic divisions for each of key markets, offer similar services and are managed jointly since they have unified service development and marketing strategy. Media segment represents content operating. For each of the strategic divisions, the CODM reviews internal management reports on at least monthly basis. The reportable segments equal the operating segments thus no aggregation of operating segments was performed for the reporting purposes. ----- A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys a right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange of consideration. Leases are recorded as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by the Group. Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments for the right of use the underlying asset during the lease term: - Fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentive receivable; - Variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate; - Amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees; - The exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option; - Payment of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be determined, otherwise the Group’s incremental borrowing rate is applied. Weighted average incremental borrowing rates used in 2020 was 5.2%. There are recognition exemptions for short-term leases and leases of low-value items available on the voluntary basis. The Group has elected to apply those exemption therefore the payments associated with all short-term leases and leases of a low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT-equipment, computers, mobile phones etc. Right-of-use assets are measured initially comprising the following: - The amount of the initial measurement of lease liability, - Any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentive received, - Any initial direct costs, - Restoration costs. Subsequently, the right-of-use asset measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, and adjusted for reassessment of the lease liability due to reassessment or lease modifications. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. ----- Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The cost of inventories includes the cost of purchase, transport and expenses (including direct labour costs) incurred in bringing the inventory to its ----- Trade receivables should initially be measured at their transaction price unless they have a significant financing component. Carrying value of trade receivables reduced by allowances for estimated credit losses Individual balances are written off when management deems them not to be collectible. The Group’s contract assets are classified at amortised cost unless stated otherwise and are measured after allowances for future expected credit losses (see note 4.1.3 for more information on credit risk). The Group has recognized the following revenue-related contract assets and liabilities: Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Cash and cash equivalents are measured at amortized cost less the loss allowances determined applying the expected credit losses model descried above in section Financial assets impairment—credit loss allowance for expected credit loss. A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the company. Control is achieved where the Company has existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the activities that affect the Company’s returns and exposure or rights to variable returns from the entity. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by the Group. All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the non-controlling shareholder’s share of changes in equity since the date of the combination. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. The Group applies the economic entity model to account for transactions with owners of non-controlling interest in transactions that do not result in a loss of control. Any difference between the purchase consideration and the carrying amount of non-controlling interest acquired is recorded as a capital transaction directly in equity. The Group recognises the difference between sales consideration and the carrying amount of non-controlling interest sold as a capital transaction in the statement of changes in equity.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

There were no changes in relation to composition of segments and measurement of segment profit/loss comparing to consolidated financial statements for 2019. Information regarding the results of each reportable segment is included below. Performance is measured based on segment earnings before net finance cost, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and Adjusted EBITDA, as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the Group’s management. EBITDA is a supplemental measure of financial performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with IFRS. “EBITDA” is defined by the Group as Profit/(Loss) for the period plus income tax (benefit)/expense, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and net finance costs and share of profit/ loss of equity-accounted investee.

Subscription fee revenues,1135.148.1,,"Revenue from subscription services consists primarily of monthly fees paid by subscribers for provision of telecommunication service. These revenues are recognized within the profit or loss in proportion to the length service provided (subscription fee) over time in the period when related services are rendered. The Group generates following main subscription-based service revenue streams which are recognized in the period when the service is provided: Cable TV (CATV), Digital TV (D3), cable and fibre Internet service, satellite TV (Direct to Home—DTH) and mobile telephony service. Revenues from the rendered services relate to mobile services containing amounts charged to post-paid plan customers for monthly service fees, which includes: voice, data and SMS. Based on IFRS 15, revenue should follow performance and not timing of payment, as the Group has obligation to provide service to the customer. The revenue is recognized over time and only to the extent of provided service, and remaining of the consideration received is deferred. Mobile phone service is a “stand ready obligation” and the obligation is satisfied by passage of time so the fixed monthly fee is spread straight line over the time of the contract. The fee charged additionally for telephone conversation and SMS is a variable consideration which is recognized as revenue when the even usage giving rise to such fee occurs. Handsets subsidized represents a distinct performance obligation and realization of revenues to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis is required. The subsidy of the hardware leads to the recognition of a contract asset under IFRS 15. The total consideration allocated to this performance obligation based on the relative stand- alone selling prices of performance obligations within this contract and amount accrued at this point is recognised as contract asset. The IFRS 15 adjustment results in revenue recognition from the sale of hardware at the contract inception and the recognition of contract asset in the balance sheet. During the minimum contract duration (e.g. two years) contract asset is settled from the monthly service fee paid by the customer. The Group uses the practical expedient under IFRS 15 and recognizes fee from voice, data and SMS in the amount to which the Group has a right to invoice.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

The Group determines whether to consider each uncertain tax treatment separately or together with one or more other uncertain tax treatments based on which approach better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty. In determining the approach that better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty, an entity might consider, for example, (a) how it prepares its income tax filings and supports tax treatments; or (b) how the entity expects the taxation authority to make its examination and resolve issues that might arise from that examination. In assessing whether and how an uncertain tax treatment affects the determination of taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates, the Group assumes that a taxation authority will examine amounts it has a right to examine and have full knowledge of all related information when making those examinations.

Income tax (continued),1135.172.1,,"uncertain tax treatment, the entity shall determine the taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits or tax rates consistently with the tax treatment used or planned to be used in its income tax filings. When the Group concludes it is not probable that the taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment, the Group reflects the effect of uncertainty in determining the related taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits or tax rates. The Group reflects the effect of uncertainty for each uncertain tax treatment by using either of the following methods, depending on which method the entity expects to better predict the resolution of the uncertainty: - the most likely amount—the single most likely amount in a range of possible outcomes. The most likely amount may better predict the resolution of the uncertainty if the possible outcomes are binary or are concentrated on one value. - the expected value—the sum of the probability-weighted amounts in a range of possible outcomes. The expected value may better predict the resolution of the uncertainty if there is a range of possible outcomes that are neither binary nor concentrated on one value. When uncertain tax treatment affects current tax and deferred tax (for example, if it affects both taxable profit used to determine current tax and tax bases used to determine deferred tax), the Group makes consistent judgements and estimates for both current tax and deferred tax. SBB is eligible for investment incentives (tax holiday) according to Article 50a to 50i Serbian Corporate Income Tax (CIT). For SBB this is a second use of this type of investment tax credit. The company met required conditions to use an investment tax credit for the second time in 2016. The investment tax credit is applied for ten years. Start of investment in fixed assets for the second investment tax credit is 1 January 2016. Each year the proportion for this investment needs to be calculated. Calculation of this percentage represent the ratio of investment in fixed assets that meet requirements from Serbian CIT art 50a to 50i (certain assets need to be excluded such as aircraft and watercrafts, passenger cars, furniture and assets that hasn’t been paid during the cumulative period) and total investment in fix assets (for period from 1 January 2016—according to invested amount in fixed assets and for previous period according to fixed amount of assets book value). The percentage which can be apply as investment tax credit on calculated CIT is changing every year. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of tax losses, because it is more likely than not that future taxable profit will not be available against which the Group can use the benefits therefrom.

This impairment test is performed to compare the recoverable amount of each Cash Generating Unit (CGU) or, if necessary in cases of goodwill, CGU to the carrying value of the CGU (including goodwill, if goodwill has been allocated to CGU or group of CGUs). A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. The value in use of each asset or group of assets is determined as the discounted value of future cash flows (Discounted Cash Flow method (DCF)) by using cash flow projections consistent with the budget of the following year, the most recent forecasts prepared by the operating segments and long-term projections. Applied discount rates are determined by reference to available external sources of information, usually based on financial institutions’ benchmarks, and reflect the current assessment by the Group of the time value of money and risks specific to each asset or group of assets. Perpetual growth rates used for the evaluation of CGUs are those used to prepare budgets for each CGU or group of CGUs, and beyond the period covered, are consistent with growth rates estimated by the business by extrapolating growth rates used in the budgets, without exceeding the long-term average growth rate for the markets in which the group operates. The fair value (less costs to sell) is the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or group of assets in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, less costs to sell. These values are generally determined on the basis of market data (stock market prices or comparison with similar listed companies, with the value attributed to similar assets or companies in recent transactions) or, in the absence of such data, on the basis of discontinued cash flows. If the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value of an asset or group of assets, an impairment loss equal to the difference is recognized in statement of profit and loss. In the case of a group of assets, this impairment loss is first recorded against goodwill. Impairment losses recognized in respect of goodwill cannot be reversed at a later date. CGUs are independently defined at each business level, corresponding to the group operating segments. An impairment test of goodwill is performed by the Group for each CGU or group of CGUs, depending on the level at which management measures return on operations. The following schedule summarizes the movements in the balance of goodwill:",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

The cash flow projections included specific estimates for five years and a terminal growth rate thereafter, except for Forthnet Group where extended period was included in order to normalize cash flows in years 2026 to 2030 to converge to profitability of the market participant within 5 years. The terminal growth rate was determined based on management’s estimate of the long-term compound annual Adjusted EBITDA growth rate, consistent with the assumptions that a market participant would make. Budgeted Adjusted EBITDA was estimated considering past experience, adjusted as follows: - Revenue growth was projected considering the growth levels over the past three years and market research for the relevant markets, competitive environment and management strategy for the next five years. - Corporate costs not included in individual CGU.

The cost of the business combination is measured as the fair value of the aggregate consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value, fair value of any previously held interest and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity. For each business combination, any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity is measured either at their proportionate share of the acquired entity’s identifiable net assets at the acquisition date or fair value. Consideration transferred includes any contingent consideration measured at its acquisition date fair value. The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are generally recognized in the statement of comprehensive income. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability will be recognized in accordance with IFRS 9 either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income. Contingent consideration that qualifies for classification as equity is not re-measured until it is finally settled. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed. Any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the identifiable net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill in the consolidated statement of financial position. If the cost is lower than the identifiable net assets acquired, the difference is recognized in profit or loss.

Borrowings and bonds Accounting policies",1135.312.1,,"Loans and borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred, and are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Transaction costs are incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, issue or disposal of a financial instrument. An incremental cost is one that would not have been incurred if the transaction had not taken place. Transaction costs include fees and commissions paid to agents (including employees acting as selling agents), advisors, brokers and dealers, levies by regulatory agencies and securities exchanges, and transfer taxes and duties. Transaction costs do not include debt premiums or discounts, financing costs or internal administrative or holding costs. The effective interest method is a method of allocating interest income or interest expense over the relevant period, so as to achieve a constant periodic rate of interest (effective interest rate) on the carrying amount. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) In thousands of EUR unless otherwise stated 33. Borrowings and bonds (continued),1135.313.1,,"The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts (excluding future credit losses) through the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, if appropriate, to the gross carrying amount of the financial instrument. The effective interest rate discounts cash flows of variable interest instruments to the next interest repricing date, except for the premium or discount which reflects the credit spread over the floating rate specified in the instrument, or other variables that are not reset to market rates. Such premiums or discounts are amortised over the whole expected life of the instrument. The present value calculation includes all fees paid or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. For assets that are purchased or originated credit impaired (“POCI”) at initial recognition, the effective interest rate is adjusted for credit risk, i.e. it is calculated based on the expected cash flows on initial recognition instead of contractual payments. Upon origination of the bonds and RCF, transaction costs were included in the financial liabilities recognized. Interest expense recorded includes amortization of these transaction costs deferred at initial recognition to maturity amount using the effective interest method. Amortized transaction costs are not presented separately and is included in the carrying values of the borrowings (as a reducing item). The Group does not have qualifying asset for capitalised borrowing costs, therefore no borrowing costs were capitalized to the value of property, plant and equipment as at 31 December 2020.

The LTIS is funded/settled in its entirety by the Group’s external shareholders. On 27 September 2018, Summer Bidco B.V., an entity controlled by Funds advised by BC Partners, entered into a share purchase agreement (“SPA”) to acquire the entire share capital (excluding treasury shares) of Adria Topco BV (the “Target”) from Adria Luxco S.a.r.l. (the “Seller”). The consummation of the Group Acquisition pursuant to the Group Share Purchase Agreement which was subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including clearance by competition authorities concluded on 4 March 2019. The consummation of the Group acquisition represented an Exit under the LTIS Agreement. The Group has recognized the effects of the LTIS Agreement in its consolidated financial statements for the period ending 31 December 2019, as equity-settled Group Share-based payment transaction under IFRS 2— Share-based payment—as LTIS Agreement is structured in a Group context where multiple Group entities receive services from employees. It also provides the responsibility of shareholders to settle the bonus (sharebased payment) to employees who are providing services to several group companies. The bonus amount under the LTIS Agreement at closing amounted to EUR 54,468 thousand, which relates to the period of services provided from the LTIS Agreement signing to the grant date when all parties will have shared understanding of key conditions pertaining LTIS Agreement. The service period ended 31 August 2019. The Group recognized in its consolidated financial statements for the period ending 30 September 2019 and 31 December 2019 related expense in the amount of EUR 21,659 thousand and EUR 21,659 thousand, retrospectively which corresponds to the eligible managers’ period of service from LTIS Agreement signing to the end of the reporting period. From the perspective of the Group financial performance for the periods ending 30 September 2019 and 31 December 2019, the recognition of the transaction resulted in a lower reported net profit of the Group, in the amount of EUR 21,659 thousand and EUR 21,659 thousand, retrospectively. The same amounts of EUR 21,659 thousand and EUR 21,659 thousand, retrospectively, as guided by IFRS 2, the Group recognized an increase in equity (Contribution from shareholder).

In court, Telemach Slovenia is challenging Agency’s decision of May 2019, by which the Agency in the renewed frequencies allotment procedure has rejected Tušmobil’s request for allocation of said radiofrequencies and reversed its allotment decision of 2008, coming into the effect as of 31 December 2019.

The Slovenian Competition Protection Agency (hereinafter—the Agency) ordered the Group to divest the activity of broadcasting Sport Klub (SK) TV channels within nine months and imposed a ban prohibiting the Group from broadcasting sports TV channels in Slovenia for three years from the date of divestment (with the exception of the existing Fight Channel). In October 2018, the Slovenian Supreme Court issued our proposed interim injunction and stayed the implementation of the Agency’s divestment decision until a final decision on the merits of this case has been issued. The lawsuit against the divestment decision is pending. In addition, in a separate misdemeanour proceeding a fine of up to a legal maximum of 10% of annual revenue of the Group could be imposed for each of the next two breaches: (i) filing of concentration notification to the Agency with delay and (ii) breaching of the stand still obligation. In May 2019, the Agency issued decision on misdemeanour procedure by which financial fine in the amount of EUR 3.7 million was imposed. The Group appealed against the decision and seek to annul or change decision in order to abolish the financial fine or at least lower it. In January 2021, the Administrative court ruled the fine in the amount of EUR 1.56 million. The Group appealed this ruling and requested a further reduction in the amount of the fine. In February 2015, the Slovenian Competition Protection Agency initiated a proceeding regarding the abuse of dominant market position by United Media Limited, IKO Balkan (now United Media Distribution) and its Slovenian subsidiary IKO Media PRO d.o.o. (former subsidiary of the IKO Balkan—liquidated in 2016) in the wholesale market for the supply of pay TV sports channels in Slovenia for a period beginning around August 2012. This proceeding is currently still in its initial stages as no statement of objections has been issued by the Slovenian Competition Protection Agency. If the Agency in this procedure ruled that the dominant position existed and was abused a fine of up to the legal maximum of 10% of annual revenue of the previously described companies involved in the procedure could be imposed. The Group management, supported by its legal advisors, at this point assessed that it is likely that fine could be imposed and that level of fine would not have material adverse impact on its financial position.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

382_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1135,INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,1135.421,Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements,1135.421.1,,"Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control. - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. - Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

Postponing of certain sports events effected by reduction of revenue and relevant costs. Decline in media selling revenue will be offset by decline in relevant costs. All this combined by overall cost optimization efforts should result in stable Adjusted EBITDA in Media segment compared to previous year. _Financing and liquidity_ The Group expects to have sufficient cash reserves and cash generated for the forecast period to meet its financing obligations. Net working capital is regularly monitored at each component level. Certain capex investments, except those necessary for maintaining normal operations, have been postponed. Efforts have been made to keep collection of receivables at highest possible level however, the management anticipates increase in impairment loss on trade receivables up to 3million in comparison to previous year.

Business model is determined for a group of assets (on a portfolio level) based on all relevant evidence about the activities that the Group undertakes to achieve the objective set out for the portfolio available at the date of the assessment. Financial assets—classification and subsequent measurement—cash flow characteristics. Where the business model is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows or to hold contractual cash flows and sell, the Group assesses whether the cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest (“SPPI”). Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows are consistent with the SPPI feature. In making this assessment, the Group considers whether the contractual cash flows are consistent with a basic lending arrangement, i.e. interest includes only consideration for credit risk, time value of money, other basic lending risks and profit margin. Where the contractual terms introduce exposure to risk or volatility that is inconsistent with a basic lending arrangement, the financial asset is classified and measured at FVTPL. The SPPI assessment is performed on initial recognition of an asset and it is not subsequently reassessed. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Significant accounting policies (continued),535.6.5,Financial assets impairment—credit loss allowance for ECL,"The Group assesses, on a forward-looking basis, the ECL for debt instruments measured at AC and FVOCI and for the exposures arising from loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts, for contract assets. The Group measures ECL and recognises net impairment losses on financial and contract assets at each reporting date. The measurement of ECL reflects: (i) an unbiased and probability weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes, (ii) time value of money and (iii) all reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost and effort at the end of each reporting period about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future conditions. Debt instruments measured at AC, trade and other receivables, loans issued and contract assets are presented in the consolidated statement of financial position net of the allowance for ECL. For loan commitments and financial guarantees, a separate provision for ECL is recognised as a liability in the consolidated statement of financial position. For debt instruments at FVOCI, changes in amortised cost, net of allowance for ECL, are recognised in profit or loss and other changes in carrying value are recognised in OCI as gains less losses on debt instruments at FVOCI. The Group applies simplified approach for impairment of trade receivables without significant financing component and contract assets. For other financial assets the Group applies a three-stage model for impairment, based on changes in credit quality since initial recognition. A financial instrument that not had a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition or that have low credit risk at the reporting date is classified in Stage 1. Financial assets in Stage 1 have their ECL measured at an amount equal to the portion of lifetime ECL that results from default events possible within the next 12 months or until contractual maturity, if shorter (“12 Months ECL”). If the Group identifies a significant increase in credit risk (“SICR”) since initial recognition, the asset is transferred to Stage 2 and its ECL is measured based on ECL on a lifetime basis, that is, up until contractual maturity but considering expected prepayments, if any (“Lifetime ECL”). If the Group determines that a financial asset is credit-impaired, the asset is transferred to Stage 3 and its ECL is measured as a Lifetime ECL. For financial assets that are purchased or originated credit-impaired (“POCI Assets”), the ECL is always measured as a Lifetime ECL.

These revenues are recognized within the profit or loss in proportion to the length service provided (subscription fee) over time in the period when related services are rendered. The Group generates following main subscription-based service revenue streams which are recognized in the period when the service is provided: Cable TV (CATV), Digital TV (D3), cable and fibre Internet service, satellite TV (Direct to Home—DTH) and mobile telephony service. _Mobile telephone service revenues_ Revenues from the rendered services relate to mobile services containing amounts charged to post-paid plan customers for monthly service fees, which includes: voice, data and SMS. Based on IFRS 15, revenue should follow performance and not timing of payment, as the Group has obligation to provide service to the customer. The revenue is recognized over time and only to the extent of provided service, and remaining of the consideration received is deferred. Mobile phone service is a “stand ready”obligation”and the obligation is satisfied by passage of time so the fixed monthly fee is spread straight line over the time of the contract. The fee charged additionally for telephone conversation and SMS is a variable consideration which is recognized as revenue when the even usage giving rise to such fee occurs. Handsets subsidized represents a distinct performance obligation and realization of revenues to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis is required. The subsidy of the hardware leads to the recognition of a contract asset under IFRS 15. The total consideration allocated to this performance obligation based on the relative stand- alone selling prices of performance obligations within this contract and amount accrued at this point is recognised as contract asset. The IFRS 15 adjustment results in revenue recognition from the sale of hardware at the contract inception and the recognition of contract asset in the balance sheet. During the minimum contract duration (two years) contract asset is settled from the monthly service fee paid by the customer. The Group uses the practical expedient under IFRS15 and recognizes fee from voice, data and SMS in the amount to which the Group has a right to invoice.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Significant accounting policies (continued),535.6.26,,"The Group has applied the following standards and amendments for the first time for its annual financial statements commencing 1 January 2019: - IFRS 16 Leases - Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation—Amendments to IFRS 9 - Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures—Amendments to IAS 28 - Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2015-2017 Cycle - Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement—Amendments to IAS 19 - Interpretation 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments. The Group had to change its accounting policies as a result of adopting IFRS 16. The group elected to adopt the new rules retrospectively but recognised the cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard on 1 January 2019. This is disclosed in note 4. The other amendments listed above did not have any impact on the amounts recognised in prior periods and are not expected to significantly affect the current or future periods. organised workforce should be present as a condition for classification as a business if are no outputs. The definition of the term ‘outputs’ is narrowed to focus on goods and services provided to customers, generating investment income and other income, and it excludes returns in the form of lower costs and other economic benefits. It is also no longer necessary to assess whether market participants are capable of replacing missing elements or integrating the acquired activities and assets. An entity can apply a ‘concentration test’. The assets acquired would not represent a business if substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single asset (or a group of similar assets). Definition of materiality—Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 (issued on 31 October 2018 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020). The amendments clarify the definition of material and how it should be applied by including in the definition guidance that until now has featured elsewhere in IFRS. In addition, the explanations accompanying the definition have been improved. Finally, the amendments ensure that the definition of material is consistent across all IFRS Standards. Information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence the decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those consolidated financial statements, which provide financial information about a specific reporting entity. Interest rate benchmark reform—Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 (issued on 26 September 2019 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020). The amendments were triggered by replacement of benchmark interest rates such as LIBOR and other inter-bank offered rates (‘IBORs’). The amendments provide temporary relief from applying specific hedge accounting requirements to hedging relationships directly affected by the IBOR reform. Classification of liabilities as current or non-current—Amendments to IAS 1 (issued on 23 January 2020 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022).These narrow scope amendments clarify that liabilities are classified as either current or non-current, depending on the rights that exist at the end of the reporting period. Liabilities are non-current if the entity has a substantive right, at the end of the reporting period, to defer settlement for at least twelve months. The guidance no longer requires such a right to be unconditional. Management’s expectations whether they will subsequently exercise the right to defer settlement do not affect classification of liabilities. The right to defer only exists if the entity complies with any relevant conditions as of the end of the reporting period. A liability is classified as current if a condition is breached at or before the reporting date even if a waiver of that condition is obtained from the lender after the end of the reporting period. Conversely, a loan is classified as non-current if a loan covenant is breached only after the reporting date. In addition, the amendments include clarifying the classification requirements for debt a company might settle by converting it into equity. ‘Settlement’ is defined as the extinguishment of a liability with cash, other resources embodying economic benefits or an entity’s own equity instruments. There is an exception for convertible instruments that might be converted into equity, but only for those instruments where the conversion option is classified as an equity instrument as a separate component of a compound financial instrument. The new standards and interpretations are not expected to affect significantly the Group’s consolidated financial statements. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in profit or loss and presented within finance costs. (excluding future credit losses) through the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, if appropriate, to the gross carrying amount of the financial instrument. The effective interest rate discounts cash flows of variable interest instruments to the next interest repricing date, except for the premium or discount which reflects the credit spread over the floating rate specified in the instrument, or other variables that are not reset to market rates. Such premiums or discounts are amortised over the whole expected life of the instrument. The present value calculation includes all fees paid or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. For assets that are purchased or originated credit impaired (“POCI”) at initial recognition, the effective interest rate is adjusted for credit risk, i.e. it is calculated based on the expected cash flows on initial recognition instead of contractual payments. Financial assets—reclassification. Financial instruments are reclassified only when the business model for managing the portfolio as a whole change. The reclassification has a prospective effect and takes place from the beginning of the first reporting period that follows after the change in the business model. AC because: (i) they are held for collection of contractual cash flows and those cash flows represent SPPI, and (ii) they are not designated at FVTPL. Features mandated solely by legislation, such as the bail-in legislation in certain countries, do not have an impact on the SPPI test, unless they are included in contractual terms such that the feature would apply even if the legislation is subsequently changed. Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with original maturities of three months or less. Cash and cash equivalents are measured at amortized cost less the loss allowances determined applying the expected credit losses model descried above in section Financial assets impairment—credit loss allowance for ECL. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of selfconstructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to a working condition for their intended use, the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located and capitalized borrowing costs. Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalized as part of that equipment. When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment. The gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of the property, plant and equipment, and is recognized net within other income/other expenses in profit or loss. Trademarks include following trade names: “SBB”, “Total TV”, “Telemach”, “Sport Klub”, “Nova TV” and “Direct Media”. The amortization charge for each period should be recognized in profit or loss statement as amortization of programming rights. Advance payments for acquired programming assets, prior to licence begin date, are recognized as prepayments for programming assets. Signed and binding contracts for purchase of programming, which do not meet recognition criteria for programming assets are not recognized in the balance sheet and are instead disclosed as contractual commitments in the amount of the outstanding contract liability at the reporting date. the amount of revenue that should be recognized in relation to a contract with a customer and thus, there is no need to determine the present value of future cash flows from handset to calculate the initial value of the contract asset. The Group will continue to monitor contract offerings and mobile business models business information/data and online/digital. The Group acts as principal in media selling (note 6). Media selling revenue is recognized over the time of providing the service. Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Current tax payable also includes any tax liability arising from the declaration of dividends. Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognized for: - temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, - temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements to the extent that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and - taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax assets are recognized for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously.

Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture—Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 (issued on 11 September 2014 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after a date to be determined by the IASB). These amendments address an inconsistency between the requirements in IFRS 10 and those in IAS 28 in dealing with the sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture. The main consequence of the amendments is that a full gain or loss is recognised when a transaction involves a business. A partial gain or loss is recognised when a transaction involves assets that do not constitute a business, even if these assets are held by a subsidiary. IFRS 17 “Insurance Contracts”(issued on 18 May 2017 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021). IFRS 17 replaces IFRS 4, which has given companies dispensation to carry on accounting for insurance contracts using existing practices. As a consequence, it was difficult for investors to compare and contrast the financial performance of otherwise similar insurance companies. IFRS 17 is a single principle-based standard to account for all types of insurance contracts, including reinsurance contracts that an insurer holds. The standard requires recognition and measurement of groups of insurance contracts at: (i) a risk-adjusted present value of the future cash flows (the fulfilment cash flows) that incorporates all of the available information about the fulfilment cash flows in a way that is consistent with observable market information; plus (if this value is a liability) or minus (if this value is an asset) (ii) an amount representing the unearned profit in the group of contracts (the contractual service margin). Insurers will be recognising the profit from a group of insurance contracts over the period they provide insurance coverage, and as they are released from risk. If a group of contracts is or becomes loss-making, an entity will be recognising the loss immediately. Amendments to the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (issued on 29 March 2018 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020). The revised Conceptual Framework includes a new chapter on measurement; guidance on reporting financial performance; improved definitions and guidance—in particular the definition of a liability; and clarifications in important areas, such as the roles of stewardship, prudence and measurement uncertainty in financial reporting. Definition of a business—Amendments to IFRS 3 (issued on 22 October 2018 and effective for acquisitions from the beginning of annual reporting period that starts on or after 1 January 2020). The amendments revise definition of a business. A business must have inputs and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. The new guidance provides a framework to evaluate when an input and a substantive process are present, including for early stage companies that have not generated outputs.

An active market is one in which transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

Fair value measurements are analysed by level in the fair value hierarchy as follows: (i) level one are measurements at quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, (ii) level two measurements are valuations techniques with all material inputs observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices), and (iii) level three measurements are valuations not based on solely observable market data (that is, the measurement requires significant unobservable inputs). Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are deemed to have occurred at the end of the reporting period. Transaction costs are incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, issue or disposal of a financial instrument. An incremental cost is one that would not have been incurred if the transaction had not taken place. Transaction costs include fees and commissions paid to agents (including employees acting as selling agents), advisors, brokers and dealers, levies by regulatory agencies and securities exchanges, and transfer taxes and duties. Transaction costs do not include debt premiums or discounts, financing costs or internal administrative or holding costs. Amortised cost (“AC”) is the amount at which the financial instrument was recognised at initial recognition less any principal repayments, plus accrued interest, and for financial assets less any allowance for expected credit losses (“ECL”). Accrued interest includes amortisation of transaction costs deferred at initial recognition and of any premium or discount to the maturity amount using the effective interest method. Accrued interest income and accrued interest expense, including both accrued coupon and amortised discount or premium (including fees deferred at origination, if any), are not presented separately and are included in the carrying values of the related items in the consolidated statement of financial position. The effective interest method is a method of allocating interest income or interest expense over the relevant period, so as to achieve a constant periodic rate of interest (effective interest rate) on the carrying amount. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset’s or CGU’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. This impairment test is performed to compare the recoverable amount of each Cash Generating Unit (CGU) or, if necessary in cases of goodwill, CGU to the carrying value of the CGU (including goodwill, if goodwill has been allocated to CGU or group of CGUs). A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. The value in use of each asset or group of assets is determined as the discounted value of future cash flows (Discounted Cash Flow method (DCF)) by using cash flow projections consistent with the budget of the following year, the most recent forecasts prepared by the operating segments and long-term projections. Applied discount rates are determined by reference to available external sources of information, usually based on financial institutions’ benchmarks, and reflect the current assessment by the Group of the time value of money and risks specific to each asset or group of assets. Perpetual growth rates used for the evaluation of CGUs are those used to prepare budgets for each CGU or group of CGUs, and beyond the period covered, are consistent with growth rates estimated by the business by extrapolating growth rates used in the budgets, without exceeding the long-term average growth rate for the markets in which the group operates. The fair value (less costs to sell) is the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or group of assets in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, less costs to sell. These values are generally determined on the basis of market data (stock market prices or comparison with similar listed companies, with the value attributed to similar assets or companies in recent transactions) or, in the absence of such data, on the basis of discontinued cash flows. If the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value of an asset or group of assets, an impairment loss equal to the difference is recognized in statement of profit and loss. In the case of a group of assets, this impairment loss is first recorded against goodwill. The impairment losses recognized in respect of property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets (other than goodwill) may be reversed in a later period if the recoverable amount becomes greater than the carrying value, within the limit of impairment losses previously recognized. Impairment losses recognized in respect of goodwill cannot be reversed at a later date. Impairment losses are recognized in the statement of profit or loss. Non-financial assets, excluding goodwill, that suffered impairment, are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date. CGUs are independently defined at each business level, corresponding to the group operating segments. An impairment test of goodwill is performed by the Group for each CGU or group of CGUs, depending on the level at which management measures return on operations. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

The Group determines whether to consider each uncertain tax treatment separately or together with one or more other uncertain tax treatments based on which approach better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty. In determining the approach that better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty, an entity might consider, for example, (a) how it prepares its income tax filings and supports tax treatments; or (b) how the entity expects the taxation authority to make its examination and resolve issues that might arise from that examination. In assessing whether and how an uncertain tax treatment affects the determination of taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates, the Group assumes that a taxation authority will examine amounts it has a right to examine and have full knowledge of all related information when making those examinations. When the Group concludes it is probable that the taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment, the entity shall determine the taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits or tax rates consistently with the tax treatment used or planned to be used in its income tax filings. When the Group concludes it is not probable that the taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment, the Group reflects the effect of uncertainty in determining the related taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits or tax rates. The Group reflects the effect of uncertainty for each uncertain tax treatment by using either of the following methods, depending on which method the entity expects to better predict the resolution of the uncertainty: a) the most likely amount—the single most likely amount in a range of possible outcomes. The most likely amount may better predict the resolution of the uncertainty if the possible outcomes are binary or are concentrated on one value. b) the expected value—the sum of the probability-weighted amounts in a range of possible outcomes. The expected value may better predict the resolution of the uncertainty if there is a range of possible outcomes that are neither binary nor concentrated on one value. When uncertain tax treatment affects current tax and deferred tax (for example, if it affects both taxable profit used to determine current tax and tax bases used to determine deferred tax), the Group makes consistent judgements and estimates for both current tax and deferred tax.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Change of accounting policy,535.38.1,,"This note explains the impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 Leases on the Group’s consolidated financial statements and also discloses the new accounting policies that have been applied from 1 January 2019, where they are different to those applied in prior periods. IFRS 16 introduces a single, on-balance sheet lease accounting model for lessees. A lessee recognises a rightof-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. There are recognition exemptions for short-term leases and leases of low-value items available on the voluntary basis. The Group has elected to apply those exemption therefore the payments associated with all short-term leases and leases of a low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT-equipment, computers, mobile phones etc. The Group elected the following practical expedients: - no adjustment on transition for leases for which the underlying asset is of low-value; - no adjustment on transition for leases of short term; -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

GROUP Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 (Continued) In thousands of EUR (unless otherwise stated) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 4. Change of accounting policy (continued),535.39.1,,"- exempt leases for which the lease term end within 12 months after the date of initial application and account those as short-term leases; - a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics; - adjust the right-of-use asset for any recognized onerous lease provisions, instead of performing an impairment review; - exclude initial direct costs from the measurement of the right-of-use asset; - use hindsight, such as in determining the lease term if the contract contains options to extend or terminate; - does not separate non-lease components for all classes of assets. Lessor accounting remains similar to the current standard—i.e. lessors continue to classify leases as finance or operating leases. _Accounting policy applied until 31 December 2018_ Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Group as lessee are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the Group as lessee are classified as finance leases. At the commencement of the lease term, finance leases are recognised as assets and liabilities in statement of financial position at amounts equal to the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. _Accounting policy applied from 1 January 2019_ Leases are recorded as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by the Group. Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments for the right of use the underlying asset during the lease term: - Fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentive receivable; - Variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate; - Amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees; - The exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonable certain to exercise that option; - Payment of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be determined, otherwise the Group’s incremental borrowing rate is applied. For the incremental borrowing rate, the Group considered the rate of interest that it would have to pay to borrow, over a similar term and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment. When calculating the incremental borrowing rate, the Group considered the rate at which the entity borrows funds (bond rate) and does not reflect the cost of equity finance. As at 1 January 2019, the Adria Midco BV (the Group) had three tranches of euro denominated corporate bonds outstanding. Two of secured bond notes (secured with UG subsidiaries’property, equipment, intangible assets and receivables) had a fixed interest of 4.375% and 4.875% respectively and mature in 2022 and 2024, ----- respectively. Length of the Group leases range from 2 to 29.6 years. The third tranche, which has a floating rate, does not significantly differ in terms. In general, these bonds best reflect the rate at which the Group could borrow funds and also reflects secured borrowing (rather than an unsecured borrowing or a general line of credit). Two of secured bond notes have been used as a starting point, base rate. No additional adjustment was required, due to the fact that the lessor effectively has security of owning the asset and no highly illiquid asset have been leased. For determining appropriate lease terms, linear interpolation / extrapolation has been used as one of the simpler methods to estimate rates beyond the original observation range. Weighted average incremental borrowing rates used at the date of 1 January 2019 and first application of IFRS 16 was 5.5% for EUR as majority of lease contracts. The lease term is a non-cancellable period of a lease; extension options or periods after termination options are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended or not terminated. In determining the lease term, management considers all fact and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not to exercise a termination option. The assessment is reviewed if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs which affects this assessment and that is within the control of the Group. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. Right-of-use assets are measured initially at cost comprising the following: - The amount of the initial measurement of lease liability, - Any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentive received, - Any initial direct costs, - Restoration costs. Subsequently, the right-of-use asset measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, and adjusted for reassessment of the lease liability due to reassessment or lease modifications. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. Depreciation rates for right-of-use asset as per asset classes are as follows: - Properties: 4% to 93%; - Base stations: 3% to 93%; - Machinery and equipment: 17%; - Optical fibres: 7% to 52% - Satellite transponder: 17% - Motor vehicles: 20% to 80% - Water surface 13%. _Definition of lease_ Previously, the Group determined at contract inception whether an arrangement was or contained a lease under the IFRIC 4 and IAS 17. The Group now assesses whether the contract is or contains lease based on the ----- new definition of lease. Under IFRS 16, a contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys a right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange of consideration. The Group applies the practical expedient to grandfather the definition of a lease on transition. This means that it will apply IFRS 16 to all contracts entered into before 1 January 2019 and identified as leases in accordance with IAS 17 and IFRIC 4. _As a lessee_ The Group leases many assets including properties, satellite capacity, facilities and infrastructure which were previously recognized under operating lease. Leases are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions (including termination and renewal rights). The main lease features are summarised below: - Properties are leased for the fixed period of 1 to 23 years, starting from the date of first implementation of IFRS 16. The contracts contain an option to renew the lease. The majority of lease payments are fixed, some with variable part based on index or rate. - Base stations are leased for the fixed period of 1 to 30 years, starting from the date of first implementation. The lease payments are fixed or fixed with variable part based on index or rate. - Machinery and equipment are leased for one to eight years, starting from the date of first implementation. The leased payments are fixed. - Optical fibres are rented for the fixed period of 1 to 15 years. The lease payments are fixed. - The satellite transponder lease is for six years, starting from the date of first implementation. The leased payments are fixed. - Motor vehicles are leased for the fixed period of 1 to 4 years, starting from the date of first implementation. The leased payments are fixed. - The right of use of a water surface for laying optical network and cable-distribution system for period of 10 years. The lease payments are fixed. - Use of under land surface owned by local municipality for placing the cables for period of 12 months, with extension option. The lease payment is variable, not based on rate or index. Previously, the Group recognised operating lease expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, and recognised assets and liabilities only to the extent that there was a timing difference between actual lease payments and the expense recognised. Under IFRS 16, the Group recognises new assets and liabilities for its operating leases of satellite, office facilities, part of infrastructure, as well base stations and the right of use of a water and land surface. The nature of expenses related to those leases has been changed because the Group will recognise a depreciation charge for right-of-use assets and interest expense on lease liabilities.

The Group’s performance management is focused on generating budgeted Adjusted EBITDA as well as maintaining overall liquidity position to repay the financial debt (note 22). An important key performance indicator for the communication with investors, analysts, and rating agencies is Net leverage (calculated as Adjusted Net Debt to Annualized Last Two Quarters Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA).

The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. The Group’s policy on liquidity is to maintain sufficient liquid resources to meet its obligations as they fall due, which has been achieved through appropriate bank arrangements (note 32). Typically, the Group seeks to ensure that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected current liabilities as they fall due, including the servicing of financial obligations; this excludes the potential impact of extreme circumstances that cannot reasonably be predicted, such as natural disasters. The Group has covenants relating to Revolving Credit Facility and bonds. Covenants relating to bonds are active only when the Group decides to issue new bonds or refinance old one. Covenants relating to RCF are monitored regularly (note 32). The liquidity table presenting the contractual maturities of financial liabilities at undiscounted amounts is presented in the note 22. Liquidity risk arises from the mismatch of the contractual maturity of monetary assets and liabilities and the possibility that trade debtors may not be able to settle obligations to the Company/Group within the normal terms of trade. To manage such risk, the Parent company uses planning techniques, including but not limited to, arrangement of revolving and/or overdraft facilities, daily liquidity reports, and short and medium-term cash forecasts. _Maturity analysis_ The table below presents the financial liabilities of the Group/Company, grouped by remaining term to maturity, determined against the contractual maturity at the reporting date.

The Group closely monitors current market rates in order to minimize negative effects of significant movements in market rates. The Group does not use these instruments for speculative purposes.

Critical accounting estimates and judgments (continued),535.73.1,,"- Impairment of goodwill The Group tests annually whether goodwill with indefinite useful life, suffer any impairment in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy. Discounted cash flow method for annual impairment testing is based on management assumptions on projected revenue growth and market research for the relevant markets, competitive environment and management strategy for the next five years (note 20). - Contractual customer relationships The Group tests annually impairment indicators of contractual customer relationships. Discounted cash flow method is based on management assumptions on projected revenue growth and market research for the relevant markets, competitive environment and management strategy for the next five years. - Expected credit loss The calculation and measurement of expected credit loss in relation to trade receivables and contract assets is an area where significant judgement is required to select an appropriate methodology, models and data inputs. Details of ECL measurement methodology are disclosed in note 3(e). In the calculation of the default rate, the Group’s models predominantly use historical information which is derived from the Group’s systems of market data. - Recognition of revenue and allocation of transaction price The Group is determining and allocating the transaction prices to separate performance obligations in the contract; the allocation is based on the reference to their relative standalone selling prices that could be obtained if the promised goods and services were sold individually in a separate transaction. The standalone selling prices are determined based on the list prices at which the Group sells handsets and telecommunication services, if sold separately. - Advertising and media selling The Group recognized revenue from advertising and media selling on gross basis, i.e. acting as principal. In arriving to that conclusion, the management has taken into consideration guidance of IFRS 15 on principle vs agent as well as local industry practice. The main assumptions taken by management are that the Group control the price and service.

Segment information is provided partially on the basis of geographic areas and partially based on an organizational structure, being the basis on which the Group manages its operations. Operating results of segments are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (CODM) and discrete financial information is available on that level. Revenue is attributed to a country based on the location of the sub-group reporting the revenue. The functions of CODM are performed by the Managing directors of the Group. The Group has five operating segments, four in cable and internet and one in media business line, which are the Group’s strategic divisions. Cable strategic divisions for each of key markets, offer similar services and are managed jointly since they have unified service development and marketing strategy. Media segment represents content operating. For each of the strategic divisions, the CODM reviews internal management reports on at least monthly basis.

This segment includes the results of our media and content business in the former Yugoslav region including the results of N1 Info, Grand Production, Orlando Kids, Nova TV, Nova M and Nova BH, as well as Direct Media. - Other segments includes our other operating business, such as Solford and non-operating holding companies (United Group B.V., Adria Cable B.V., Adria Serbia Holdco B.V., Slovenia Broadband S.A.R.L.). Revenue reported in other is mainly generated by Solford. There were no changes in relation to composition of segments and measurement of segment profit/loss comparing to consolidated financial statements for 2018. Information regarding the results of each reportable segment is included below. Performance is measured based on segment earnings before net finance cost, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and Adjusted EBITDA, as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the Group’s management. EBITDA is a supplemental measure of financial performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with IFRS. “EBITDA” is defined by the Group as Profit/(Loss) for the period plus income tax (benefit)/expense, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and net finance costs. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for shareholder-related costs, legal and advisory—M&A related costs, group restructuring costs, income from the disposal of companies, impairment charges for obsolete equipment in Slovenia, other management-related costs, specific penalties, additional impact of application of new standards (just for transitory period) and other non-core operating expenses, which Group views as non-operating and not recurring to the operations of the Group (note 17). Segment Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (note 17) is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries. (a) Description of products and services from which each reportable segment derives its revenue The Group’s main activities are providing of Video, Data and Voice services to subscribers in the countries of South-East Europe.

In addition to this, Direct Media group provides advertising and media services to companies in the region. (b) Factors that management used to identify the reportable segments Four of the Group’s business segments are mainly based on the Group’s geographic regions, Serbia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro, and the other business segment is broadly based on product distribution. They are managed separately because each business unit requires different marketing strategies and service level. (c) Measurement of operating segment profit or loss. The CODM reviews financial information prepared based on IFRS adjusted to meet the requirements of internal reporting. Such financial information differs in certain aspects from IFRS: i. Management consolidation adjustments can differ from the ones required by IFRS ii. non-IFRS profit measures (such as earnings before income tax, depreciation and amortization— EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and capital expenditure (CAPEX)) are also included in the segment report. Capital expenditures represents purchases of tangible and intangible assets, consisting primarily of set top box purchases and other customer capital expenditure, installations (including capitalized labour costs), cable and mobile network build out, upgrades, maintenance and other investments, computer hardware and software and content rights.

Income tax (continued),535.115.1,,"SBB and Telemach d.o.o., Slovenia are entities which primarily utilise tax losses and use tax holiday for investments in plant and equipment. During 2016, SBB managed to satisfy conditions to apply for another 10 years cycle of tax holiday, i.e. to employ 100 employees and invest more than EUR 8.5m. In 2019, SBB is utilizing the tax holiday which reduces its nominal income tax liability by 64.63%, and which expires in 10 years (in 2025). SBB is eligible for investment incentives (tax holiday) according to Article 50a to 50i Serbian Corporate Income Tax (CIT). For SBB this is a second use of this type of investment tax credit. The company met required conditions to use an investment tax credit for the second time in 2016. The investment tax credit is applied for ten years. Start of investment in fixed assets for the second investment tax credit is 1 January 2016. Each year the proportion for this investment needs to be calculated. Calculation of this percentage represent the ratio of investment in fixed assets that meet requirements from Serbian CIT art 50a to 50i (certain assets need to be excluded such as aircraft and watercrafts, passenger cars, furniture and assets that hasn’t been paid during the cumulative period) and total investment in fix assets (for period from 1 January 2016—according to invested amount in fixed assets and for previous period according to fixed amount of assets book value). The percentage which can be apply as investment tax credit on calculated CIT is changing every year. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of tax losses, because it is more likely than not that future taxable profit will not be available against which the Group can use the benefits therefrom.

Assumptions used for value-in-use calculations (refer to the above table) changed to reflect current business environment as more information became available to the Group.

The terminal growth rate was determined based on management’s estimate of the long-term compound annual Adjusted EBITDA growth rate, consistent with the assumptions that a market participant would make. Budgeted Adjusted EBITDA was estimated taking into account past experience, adjusted as follows: - Revenue growth was projected taking into account the growth levels over the past three years and market research for the relevant markets, competitive environment and management strategy for the next five years. - Corporate costs not included in individual CGU.

The Group recognized in its consolidated financial statements for the period ending 31 December 2019 related expense in the amount of EUR 21,659 thousand, which corresponds to the eligible managers’ period of service from LTIS Agreement signing to the end of the reporting period. - From the perspective of the Group financial performance for the period ending 31 December 2018, the recognition of the transaction resulted in a lower reported net profit of the Group, in the amount of EUR 32,809 thousand. The same amount of EUR 32,809 thousand, as guided by IFRS 2, the Group recognized an increase in equity (Contribution from shareholder).

The Group believes that this additional payment could be regarded as a short-term employee benefit under IAS 19, however, it is the Group’s accounting policy, where external shareholders have the obligation of settling the payment for such benefits, without recourse from the Group, and absent an IFRS requirement, not to attribute related expense to the consolidated financial statements.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Below are presented litigations which could have significant impact on the Group. 1. In 2016, BS Group d.o.o., Brus raised legal case against the Group. Subject of the dispute is violation of producer’s rights. According to the plaintiff, the Group violated territorial restriction of the contract by broadcasting certain movies on territories which were not listed in the contract. Total value of dispute amounts to EUR 25,000 thousand. The final outcome of the case will depend on the Court’s opinion on legal issues related to the basis of the request and the standing of the parties. The Group assessed that it is not probable that this proceeding will result in a negative outcome that would adversely impact on its financial position, therefore no provision has been recognised. 2. In September 2019, JKP Beogradske elektrane raised legal case against the Group. Subject of the dispute is indemnity for using their infrastructure. Total value of dispute amounts to EUR 10,000 thousand. The Group assessed that it is not probable that this proceeding will result in a negative outcome that would adversely impact on its financial position, therefore no provision has been recognised. 3. In March 2020, EPS Distribucija raised legal case against the Group. Subject of the dispute is indemnity for using their infrastructure. Total value of dispute amounts to EUR 1,000 thousand. The Group assessed that it is not probable that this proceeding will result in a negative outcome that would adversely impact on its financial position, therefore no provision has been recognised. _Investigation of the Serbian Commission for Protection of Competition in Serbia_ In November 2018 the Serbian Commission for Protection of Competition (“CPC”) issued a preliminary notice stating that (i) it believed SBB holds a dominant position in the retail market for distributing media content; (ii) price increases made by SBB were not justified by actual costs; and (iii) as a result, SBB may have abused a dominant position through excessive pricing. On 15 May 2019 CPC issued decision on suspension of further investigation. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Contingent liabilities (continued),535.299.1,,"_Investigation of Tax Authority in Serbia_ On 27 December 2017, the Serbian Ministry of Finance Tax Authority (the “Serbian Tax Authority”) started tax investigation of SBB for the year ended 31 December 2012. According to the Serbian Tax Authority’s decision issued in March 2019, it has recharacterized interest payments made by SBB Serbia under an intragroup loan agreement (and certain other transactions) as dividends, which would have been subject to a 5% withholding tax. Total liability determined amounts to EUR 21 million, including the late interest. The management assessment, supported by analysis done by external consultants (both legal and tax experts) is that there is no ground for the claim as it is not substantiated by the evidence and regulation. The Group appealed to this decision and received approval for postponing of payment until resolution of appeal. _Legal cases in Slovenia_ 1. The award of 5 MHz on 2100 MHz spectrum frequency within its 3G licenses in 2008 to Tušmobil (now Telemach Slovenia) is currently subject of judicial review before the Administrative Court against the decision issued by the Slovenian Agency for Communication Networks and Services (“Agency”). In court, Telemach Slovenia is challenging Agency’s decision of May 2019, by which the Agency in the renewed frequencies allotment procedure has rejected Tušmobil’s request for allocation of said radiofrequencies and reversed its allotment decision of 2008, coming into the effect as of 31 December 2019. Based on Telemach Slovenia’s proposal, in June 2019, the Administrative Court issued an interim injunction and therewith stayed the Agency’s decision of May 2019 until the court reaches a final decision on Telemach’s lawsuit against Agency’s decision of May 2019. The procedure before the Administrative Court concerning the Telemach Slovenia’s lawsuit is pending. Loss of the described frequency licence would lead to capacity reduction, which might cause decrease in quality of service in certain areas. However, additional frequencies granted in 2016 (and currently used by Telemach Slovenia) would support the Group to mitigate the impact of any potential loss of 3G frequencies due to a renewal of the licence allocation procedure or other revocation or impairment of the 3G license that was granted in 2008. 2. From 2012 onwards, the Slovenian Association of Composers and Authors (“SAZAS”) commenced many legal proceedings against all cable operators in Slovenia (including Telemach Slovenia) claiming infringement of copyrights and damages for the cable retransmission of musical works. Up to now, SAZAS initiated twenty-eight legal proceedings against Telemach Slovenia claiming copyright remuneration for cable retransmission of music works for periods between October 2010 and December 2015. In eighteen proceedings, courts already issued a final decision awarding SAZAS with monthly remuneration amounting to approx. EUR 0.20 per subscriber for cable retransmission of music works in TV and radio channels. On average, SAZAS was awarded with approx. 30%-40% of its original claim. Telemach already complied with these final judgements and paid the awarded amounts to SAZAS, while filed extraordinary legal means against courts’ final decisions which are for the present being reviewed by the Constitutional Court (in nine cases) and Supreme Court of Slovenia (in one case). In five proceedings, the court of first instance issued judgements, which were all appealed by both litigating parties to the Higher Court, while five proceedings are still pending before the court of first instance. 3. In September 2018, the Slovenian Competition Protection Agency ruled that the Group’s acquisition of United Media Distribution (then IKO Balkan) in 2012 is incompatible with competition rules. The Slovenian Competition Protection Agency (hereinafter—the Agency) ordered the Group to divest the activity of broadcasting Sport Klub (SK) TV channels within nine months and imposed a ban prohibiting the Group from broadcasting sports TV channels in Slovenia for three years from the date of divestment (with the exception of the existing Fight Channel). In October 2018, the Slovenian Supreme Court issued our proposed interim injunction and stayed the implementation of the Agency’s divestment decision until a final decision on the merits of this case has been issued. The lawsuit against the divestment decision is pending. In addition, in a separate misdemeanour proceeding a fine of up to a legal maximum of 10% of annual revenue of the Group could be imposed for each of the next two breaches: (i) filing of concentration notification to the Agency with delay and (ii) breaching of the stand still obligation. In May 2019, the Agency issued decision on misdemeanour procedure by which financial fine in the amount ----- of EUR 3.7 million was imposed. The Group appealed against the decision and seek to annul or change decision in order to abolish the financial fine or at least lower it. 4. In February 2015, the Slovenian Competition Protection Agency initiated a proceeding regarding the abuse of dominant market position by United Media Limited, IKO Balkan (now United Media Distribution) and its Slovenian subsidiary IKO Media PRO d.o.o. (former subsidiary of the IKO Balkan—liquidated in 2016) in the wholesale market for the supply of pay TV sports channels in Slovenia for a period beginning around August 2012. This proceeding is currently still in its initial stages as no statement of objections has been issued by the Slovenian Competition Protection Agency. If the Agency in this procedure ruled that the dominant position existed and was abused a fine of up to the legal maximum of 10% of annual revenue of the previously described companies involved in the procedure could be imposed. The Group management, supported by its legal advisors, at this point assessed that it is likely that fine could be imposed and that level of fine would not have material adverse impact on its financial position. _Legal cases in Bosnia Minority shareholders of HS d.o.o., HKB d.o.o._ As a result of acquisition of subsidiaries in Bosnia, the Group assumed significant number of ongoing court disputes. The disputes are initiated by the minority owners of companies HS d.o.o. and HKB d.o.o. which claimed compensation for damages and cancellation of a share purchase transaction. The cases has been filed against majority owners of HS d.o.o. and HKB d.o.o. for breaching minority shareholders’ rights. The provisional quantum of indemnity sought by the minority shareholders is up to EUR 12,200 thousand (including penalty interest rates and costs of the proceedings), which is determined, according to the Group legal advisors, solely by plaintiffs. Based on the advice from legal advisors, the Group management has set aside funds in escrow account for the purpose of settlement of cases. _Other cases_ In October 2017 claim is raised against Telemach d.o.o. by Swiss non-profit organization AGICOA for unpaid royalties. Telemach and Agicoa were not in the contractual relation for the period covered by the law. Agicoa claims that Telemach is liable for royalties that had been due by the companies Telemach acquired on the Bosnian market. In October 2019 claim is raised against Telemach d.o.o., KT HS d.o.o., HKB Net d.o.o. and M&H Company by UFR for unpaid royalties. Telemach and UFR (Association of filmmakers in Bosnia and Herzegovina) were not in the contractual relation for the period covered by the law. UFR claims that Telemach is liable for royalties that had been due by the companies Telemach acquired on the Bosnian market.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

The transactions are subject to customary regulatory approvals by the local competition authorities and is expected to be completed in 2020. _COVID-19_ The existence of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was confirmed in early 2020 and has spread rapidly from mainland China across the globe, causing disruptions to businesses and economic activity. Many governments across the world have imposed travel restrictions, lock downs and social distancing with a view to reducing the spread of the virus and hopefully minimizing the number of fatalities. The Group considers this outbreak to be a non-adjusting post balance sheet event. Whilst inherently uncertain, and the management expects some impact to operations and performance but currently does not believe that the COVID-19 outbreak will directly have a material adverse effect on the Group’s financial condition or liquidity for the foreseeable future such that it is not appropriate to apply the going concern principal to these financial statements. The impact of this outbreak on macroeconomic forecasts and markets are expected to be incorporated into the Group’s estimates of expected credit loss provisions and other impairments assessments in 2020, including but not limited to: Goodwill, Property, plant and equipment, Intangible assets and programming rights. Please also see disclosures in note 2(c) Going Concern. The Group’s management holds that they are not aware of any other significant post balance sheet events that could affect the consolidated financial statements for 31 December 2019 or require separate disclosure. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Significant events during the reporting period,535.353.1,,"As a preventive measure against the outburst of COVID-19 (Coronavirus) in Europe, on 13 March 2020 a state of emergency was declared in the territory of Bulgaria. All visits in certain commercial establishments such as restaurants, shopping centres, entertainment and gaming halls, etc. were suspended for two months. On 23 March 2020 Measures and Actions during a State of Emergency Act was adopted, aimed at mitigating the negative consequences of the epidemic on citizens and businesses. While the core activities of the Group were not directly affected by these measures, certain negative impact on its financial position and performance during the reporting period could be largely attributed to the COVID-19 related developments. Though no reasonable estimate of the exact financial effect of the coronavirus outbreak can be made, the impacted items of the profit and loss statement, statement of financial position and accounting estimates and judgments are presented below. Net impairment losses on financial and contract assets increased as a result of delays in customer payments during the second quarter of the year, resulting respectively in higher ECL rates and increase in allowance for impairment of trade and lease receivables measured by applying the IFRS 9 simplified approach. During the third quarter of the year the receivables collectability improved and as at the reporting date and the subsequent periods it is close to pre-coronavirus levels (refer to Note 5). The coronavirus pandemic had a negative impact on the Mobile services revenue due to lower roaming revenue, primarily as a result of coronavirus-induced travel restrictions. This was partially offset by decrease in interconnect and roaming expenses. Further impact on service revenues are limited by the increased demand for telecom services during the periods of coronavirus related restrictions. During the reporting period the incremental borrowing rates applicable to the the Group lease liabilities were reconsidered and no significant changes to the pre-coronavirus rates were determined. The other critical accounting estimates and judgements disclosed in the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 were evaluated as not impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. Potential prolonged recession and a deepening crisis could impact on growth prospects, customer spending and collection, and may result in assumptions and estimates that could trigger material adjustments to the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the future. In particular, management expects the assumptions and estimates used in determining impairment of Trade and other receivables, Contract assets, Property, plant and equipment, Intangible assets, Right-of-use assets and valuation of Investment property, and the related Deferred tax assets and liabilities to be affected. Nevertheless, at the date of these financial statements the Company continues to generate profits and sufficient cash from operations, supporting its activities. The directors, in light of their assessment of expected future cash flows are satisfied that the Company will be able to meet its obligations as they fall due for a period of at least 12 months from the reporting date. Therefore the Company continues to apply the going concern basis of preparation. On July 31, 2020 United Group Bulgaria EOOD granted to VIVACOM a related party loan with maturity of 10 years and bullet repayment at maturity. With the funds received, VIVACOM has prepaid all liabilities under the SFA. As a result, VIVACOM’s long-term debt obligation to third-party financing institutions stipulating 6-month repayment schedules and finally due in 2023 was replaced by a related party loan due 2030 which enables better liquidity management compared to the previous SFA exposure. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

At the date of valuation no active market existed and the market value was determined based on offers to sell similar plots under the assumption that these are the end prices. The offered prices have been adjusted with: discount rate ranging from 10% to 15% to reflect the actual reduction in the offered price, based on the trends of actual transactions; adjustment coefficients, derived on the basis of characteristics of the respective plots like size, environmental and geomorphologic condition, level of development and transport accessibility, and improvements of the land.

The proceeds from the bond offering were used by the Company to repay its existing indebtedness under the amended and restated loan agreement in full. The interest on the Notes was payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing May 15, 2014. In relation to the admission of the Notes the Company received a credit rating of B1 by Moody’s and BB- by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services. On 29 March 2018 and 16 May 2018 respectively Moody’s upgraded the long-term corporate credit rating of the Company to Ba3 and S&P Global Ratings reconfirmed it as BB- and in November 2019 both agencies placed the corporate credit ratings on review. On 27 March 2020 S&P Global Ratings downgraded the corporate credit rating to B+ and on 30 September 2020 lowered it to B, and withdrew the rating at VIVACOM’s request. BTC underwent a consent solicitation procedure for a waiver of the existing change of control provisions and amendment of certain definitions and ratios applicable to the Notes. The procedure was initiated in relation to the acquisition by VTL of 100% of the shares of InterV Investment S.a.r.l. On 13 June 2016, Vivacom obtained the necessary consent of 87.43% of bondholders. The amendments of Notes’ provisions entered into effect upon the execution of the first supplemental indenture on June 10, 2016 which became operative on 7 September 2016, when all the conditions precedent in the first supplemental indenture were either satisfied or waived. Simultaneously with the bond offering BTC has concluded EUR 35 million Revolving Credit Facility with Societe Generale Expressbank AD under which the Company may borrow funds for the repayment of its debt under the amended and restated loan agreement, financing of its working capital purposes and issue of bank guarantees and letters of credit. The RCF was initially agreed to be available up to 30 November 2016. The interest on the principal amounts owing by the Company under the RCF is payable monthly and was initially agreed to be the aggregate of 1 month EURIBOR plus a margin of 4% per year. Effective from 26 May 2014 the margin was reduced to 3,75% per year and from 14 November 2016 the margin was further reduced to 1,45% per year and the term was extended to 31 May 2018. On 22 December 2017 the Company entered into an up to EUR 365 million Senior Facilities Agreement (SFA) arranged by Citibank N.A., London Branch and VTB Bank (Deutschland) AG (currently VTB Bank (Europe) SE). The purpose of the facility was to refinance all amounts due under the Existing HY Bonds, payment of fees and costs under the facility and capital expenditure in respect of the Company’s investment and development program.

The interest on the facilities was based on EURIBOR plus a Margin between 1.25 and 3.75 per cent per annum. The liabilities of the Company under the SFA were guaranteed by BTC Net EOOD (subsidiary) and Viva Telecom Bulgaria OOD (parent of the Company) and were further secured by: 1) a non-possessory pledge in accordance with the Special Pledges Act on the going concern of the Company, which included among other receivables of the Company under certain bank accounts, insurance policies, related parties and customer receivables, as well as certain tangible and intangible assets (including trademarks), inventory and real estates of the Company; 2) a non-possessory pledge in accordance with the Special Pledges Act over the going concern of BTC Net, which included among other assets the receivables of BTC Net under certain bank accounts; 3) a non-possessory pledge in accordance with the Special Pledges Act over the going concern of Viva Telecom Bulgaria OOD, which included among other assets the receivables of Viva Telecom Bulgaria EOOD under certain bank accounts and the shares of the Company; 4) a non-possessory pledge in accordance with the Special Pledges Act over the shares of the Company; 5) a pledge in accordance with the Agreements on Financial Collateral Act over the shares of the Company; 6) a non-possessory pledge in accordance with the Special Pledges Act over the shares of BTC Net and a possessory pledge over the shares of NURTS Bulgaria EAD. On 19 April 2018 the Company successfully completed the refinancing of its Notes ahead of their maturity date and has delisted the Notes from the Official List and from trading on the Main Securities Market of the Irish Stock Exchange. As of the date of these financial statements the Company has deregistered the relevant securities under the Notes. Simultaneously with the SFA the Company extended the maturity of the Existing EUR 35 million Revolving Credit Facility (RCF)with Societe Generale Expressbank AD to 18 April 2021 and reduced the applicable Margin to between 1.05 and 1.75 per cent per annum. The Company has established the respective securities under the extended RCF on a pari passu basis by the same scope and type of security provided by the Company under the SFA. On 31 July 2020 United Group Bulgaria EOOD granted related party loan to BTC and with the received funds BTC successfully prepaid all liabilities under the SFA and the above referred securities under the SFA are in the course of deregistration. The outstanding principal amount of the related party loan is due in 10 years. The applicable interest is payable quarterly in arrears and is negotiated to be initially equal to 4.65 per cent per annum and following the completion of a third party transfer pricing study — to such per cent per annum determined thereunder.

Contingencies",535.594.1,,"The Company is a participant in several lawsuits and administrative proceedings. On 4 July 2016, Empreno Ventures Limited commenced legal proceedings in Bulgaria, challenging the validity of the first supplemental indenture (as referred in Note 15). Following the review on three instances, the Bulgarian courts finally dismissed the case on 16 March 2017 and the claim was rejected. On 26 August 2016, LIC Telecommunications S.à r.l. commenced legal proceedings in Luxembourg that, among other things, challenge the validity of the first supplemental indenture (as disclosed in Note 15) and claim damages amounting to EUR 62 million. In 2018 and 2019 judgments were rendered by two instance courts in Luxembourg which declared the request of LIC Telecommunications S.à r.l inadmissible and declined jurisdiction, which entered into force during the reporting period. BTC considered the legal proceedings in both Bulgaria and Luxembourg as being unmeritorious and devoid of any proper legal basis. The transactions for assignment of receivables on cash deposits in Corporate Commercial Bank AD—in bankruptcy (CCB), were executed in 2014 as per the provisions of the applicable law. One of the assigned receivables was utilised by NURTS Bulgaria EAD in order to set-off its obligations to CCB under a bond issued by NURTS Bulgaria EAD in 2013. CCB held 25,723 bonds with a nominal of EUR 1,000 each and in September 2014 NURTS Bulgaria EAD has set-off the principal in the amount of BGN 50,310 and applicable interest due to CCB in the amount of BGN 1,350 thousand against its own cash held in CCB accounts and assigned CCB cash receivables from third parties, including BTC. Despite of the validly executed transactions, the receivers of CCB have recognized only partially the set-off from NURTS Bulgaria EAD (BGN 1,543 thousand) where the remaining amount of BGN 50,117 thousand and other owned cash in CCB of BGN 116 thousand is included in the list of accepted receivables of CCB creditors. No financial assets or liabilities in relation to this matter were recognized in these financial statements. On 2 May 2017 NURTS Bulgaria EAD was notified for commencement by CCB of legal proceedings for the challenge of the set-off. On 14 May 2018 the first instance court cast a decision, as a result of which the NURTS set-offs against CCB were declared partially null and void and partially invalid vis-à-vis the creditors of CCB. The decision has not entered into force and has been appealed before the Sofia Court of Appeal. On 12 December 2019 CCB has withdrawn its claim against NURTS and on 20 December 2019 has initiated a procedure for the sale of the bonds held by CCB within which the above-referred issues between CCB and NURTS were finally resolved during the reporting period. Accordingly a provision was recognized by NURTS in 2019. As a consequence, the bonds and NURTS respectively were deregistered from the public register for issuers of securities maintained by the Bulgarian Financial Supervision Commission. After the reporting period Nurts Bulgaria AD was served with documents relating to a case that has been filed by the administrators of CCB against NURTS Bulgaria EAD claiming the return of certain assets originating from CCB. As the purported limitation period for filing such claims has expired and NURTS Bulgaria EAD has already settled all CCB claims, management believes that any chance of transfer of benefits with regards to this case to be remote and no provision has been recognised in these financial statements. Based on the information available, management is satisfied that there is no unprovided liability arising from these lawsuits and administrative proceedings, however there are inherent uncertainties related to the outcome of the cases. The recognised provisions for lawsuits are further disclosed in Note 14. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

The management of the company is in a process of confirmation of the relevant circumstances, whereas as per the date of the present financial statements no reliable and indisputable evidences were received for the existence of such contingent liability, nor for its exact amount (if such liability exists).

In March 2018 new legislation involving changes in networks deployment requirements entered into force. The new Law on Electronic Communications Network and Physical Infrastructure (LECNPI) lightens the laying of new cables in the existing duct networks, including in networks of other operators, encouraging the sharing of infrastructure. During 2019 CRC decided to deregulated access to ducts provided by BTC after a transitional period of 1 year as from the publications of the General Terms and conditions according to LECNPI. The General terms and conditions were published on 2nd June 2020 and shall enter into force on 2nd June 2021. At the end of 2020 the EU adopted a Delegate regulation setting single maximum Union-wide voice termination rates. The latter is expected to be promulgated at the beginning of Q2 2021. The single maximum rates will apply from the beginning of H2 2021. - 2120−2125 MHz (total of 5 MHz) for the territory of Bulgaria for transmitting from base stations to end mobile devices; and - 2015−2020 MHz (total of 5 MHz) for the territory of Bulgaria. In 2012 CRC granted BTC AD an additional spectrum of 5 MHz and exchanged the position of previously submitted spectrum. According to the amendment BTC had the right to use the following spectrum: - 1945−1955 MHZ (total of 10 MHz) for the territory of Bulgaria for transmitting from end mobile devices to base stations; - 2135−2145 MHz (total of 10 MHz) for the territory of Bulgaria for transmitting from base stations to end mobile devices; and - 2015−2020 MHz (total of 5 MHz) for the territory of Bulgaria. At the end of July, 2015 BTC’s permission was amended again after replacing the assigned frequency bands and providing additional spectrum BTC was granted the right to use the following spectrum: - 1965−1980 MHz (total of 15 MHz) - 2155−2170 MHz (total of 15 MHz) In Q22016 CRC assigned to BTC additional spectrum of 2x5 MHz in 1800 MHz. Following the procedure of reallocation of the assigned frequencies, currently BTC is entitled to use: - 1740−1755 MHz (total of 15 MHz) - 1835−1850 MHz (total of 15 MHz) An annual fee, calculated based on the annual revenue from telecommunication services provided to the subscribers is paid quarterly.

For 2020 and 2019 the fees paid for frequency bands in 900, 1800 and 2100 MHz amounted to BGN 7,850 thousand and BGN 7,842 thousand respectively. - TV broadcasting In 2009 CRC has granted NURTS Digital permission for use of resource from radio frequency spectrum via two networks for digital terrestrial broadcasting (DVB-T) which is mandatory for the operation of its core activity. As per decision of the European Court of Justice dated 23 April 2015, the Republic of Bulgaria is found in breach of certain provisions of European directives in relation to the provision of the digital terrestrial broadcasting permission, which has to be remedied. NURTS Digital has complied with all statutory requirements in this regard. In 2019 BTC was granted a permit for use of individually assigned scarce resource—radio frequency spectrum via digital terrestrial broadcasting (DVB-T).

The amendment to IFRS 16 only regards an illustrative example, so no effective date is stated.). Unless otherwise described above, the Group and the Company anticipate that the adoption of these standards and amendments to the existing standards will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group and the Company in the period of initial application. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Company. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases. The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Company. The cost of an acquisition is measured, as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the profit or loss. For consolidation purposes, the separate financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries have been combined on a line-by-line basis by adding together like items of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Inter-company transactions and resulting profits or losses as of 31 December, 2020 and 2019, including unrealized profits at the year end, have been eliminated in full. The estimated useful lives of the major classes of property, plant and equipment are as follows: - management intends to complete the software product and use or sell it; - there is an ability to use or sell the software product; - it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits; - adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the software product are available; and - the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured. impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as reduction of other operating expenses unless the asset is carried at revalued amount, in which case the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase. _Subsequent measurement_ For the purpose of subsequent measurement, the Group’s financial assets are classified in four categories: - Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments); - Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income with “recycling” of cumulative gains or losses (applied for debt instruments); - Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income without “recycling” of cumulative gains or losses (equity instruments); - Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss (applied for debt and equity instruments, as well as for derivative instruments under certain conditions and transactions). _Classification groups Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments)_ The Group measures a financial asset at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met: - the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows, and - the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest method. They are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss upon asset disposal, modification or impairment. The Group’s financial assets at amortised cost may include: cash and cash equivalents at banks, trade receivables and other receivables, loans to related parties and loans to third parties, corporate bonds (potentially). They are presented within the following items in the statement of financial position: cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and investments. _Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (debt instruments) (based on past experience, for future transactions)_ The Group measures its debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income, when both of the following conditions have been satisfied: - the financial asset is held and used within the business model, for the purpose of both collecting contractual cash flows and selling it; and - the conditions of the financial asset contract give rise to cash flows on specific dates, which constitute solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding. With respect to debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income, the interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment losses, including their reversal, are recognised in profit or loss and are calculated in the same manner as the one applied for financial assets measured at amortised cost. The other changes in fair value are recognised through other comprehensive income in fair value reserve. Upon derecognition, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified (recycled) from equity to profit or loss. The Group’s debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income may include: investments in quoted debt instruments (corporate bonds), which are stated within the “long-term investments” item in the statement of financial position. ----- _Financial instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (equity instruments)_ At the time of initial recognition, the Group may make an irrevocable election to account for the equity investments at fair value through other comprehensive income, but only if they meet the equity definition under IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation, and are not held for trading. The classification is determined at the level of individual instruments. The Group usually makes an irrevocable election to classify into this category minority equity investments, which it holds in the long-term and in relation to its business interests in these entities. They are presented in the statement of financial position within “investments”. The minority interest of BTC in Sofia Stock Exchange and Intersputnik (Russia) is classified within these equity instruments. Upon derecognition of these assets, gains and losses from remeasurement to fair value, recognised in other comprehensive income, are not reclassified (recycled) to profit or loss. Dividends are recognised as “finance income”in profit or loss when the right to receive payment is established, unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of an investment—in this case gains are recognised in other comprehensive income. Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are not subject to impairment tests. _Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (based on past experience, for future transactions)_ Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include: financial assets designated upon their initial recognition as “at fair value through profit or loss”, or financial assets for which a mandatory requirement exists to be measured at fair value. Derivatives, including individual embedded derivates, are also classified as held for trading, unless they have been designated as effective hedging instruments. Irrespective of the criteria for debt instruments which should be classified at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income as described above, debt instruments may be designated as “at fair value through profit or loss”upon their initial recognition, if this would eliminate or reduce a significant accounting mismatch. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are measured in the statement of financial position at fair value, with net changes in the fair value recognised in profit or loss. This category includes derivative instruments, as well as equity instruments registered for trade on stock exchanges, with respect to which the Group has not made an irrevocable election to be accounted for at fair value through other comprehensive income. Dividends from such equity instruments are also recognised within “finance income” in profit or loss when the right to receive payment is established. A derivative embedded in a hybrid contract containing a host that is financial liability or a non-financial item is separated from the host and accounted for as a separate instrument, if: the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host; a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative; and the hybrid contract is not measured at fair value through profit or loss. Embedded derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes therein are recognised in profit or loss. Remeasurement is only done if there is either a change in the contractual conditions that materially modifies the cash flows that would otherwise be required, or if there is reclassification of a financial asset outside the category of fair value through profit or loss. A derivative embedded in a hybrid contract whose host is a financial asset is not accounted for separately. The requirement is the host—financial asset, together with the embedded derivative, to be classified in its entirety as a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss. _Derecognition_ A financial asset (or, when applicable, a portion of a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised from the Group’s statement of financial position, when: ----- - the rights to cash flows from the asset have expired, or - the rights to cash flows from the asset have been transferred or the Group has assumed an obligation to pay in full the cash flows received, without undue delay, to a third party under a transfer agreement, in which: a) the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards from ownership of the asset; or b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all risks and rewards from ownership of the asset, but has transferred control thereon. When the Group has transferred its right to obtain cash flows from the asset or has concluded a transfer agreement, it assesses the extent to which it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When the Group has neither transferred, nor retained substantially all risks and rewards from ownership of the financial assets, it continues to recognise the asset transferred to the extent of its continuing interest therein. In this case, the Group also recognises the respective liability. The transferred asset and the related liability are measured on a basis reflecting the rights and obligations that the Group has retained. Continuing involvement in the form of a guarantee on the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the two values: the initial carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group may be required to pay. _Impairment of financial assets_ The Group recognises an allowance (impairment provision) for expected credit losses for all debt instruments which are not carried at fair value through profit or loss. Expected credit losses are calculated as the difference between the contractual cash flows due under the contractual conditions, and all cash flows the Group expects to receive, discounted at the initial effective interest rate. Expected cash flows also include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that constitute an integral part of the contractual conditions. _Loans to related and third parties, other significant individual receivables and cash and cash equivalents. Financial guarantees_ To calculate the expected credit losses from loans to related and third parties, other significant individual receivables, incl. cash and cash equivalents at banks, the Group applies the general impairment approach defined by IFRS 9. Under this approach, the Group applies a 3-stage impairment model based on changes versus the initial recognition of the credit quality of the financial instrument (asset). The categorization used by the Group to assess the credit risk related to loans, financial guarantees, and other individual receivables, is as follows: with expected collection trends and forecast factors specific for the debtors and the economic environment, for which a correlation has been established with the percentage of credit losses. In the provisioning matrixes used to calculate expected credit losses from trade receivables, lease and other receivables, provision rates are based on days past due for groups from different customer segments sharing similar loss models. For BTC Group, such are: corporate and business customers, residential customers and “international connectivity” customers. The Group usually assumes that the date of economic loss from uncollectability occurs 365 days after the first day of delay. This period is studied and historically assessed. The Group does not have a practice of requesting collateral for receivables from clients. Contract assets are considered to have similar risk characteristics as receivables related to devices sold on instalment under the same contracts and customers. Based on historical data about the behaviour of payment of invoices issued, contract terminations and forecast factors specific for the debtors and the economic environment, the Group determines impairment rates corresponding respectively to the outstanding balances of receivables related to devices sold on instalment (lease receivables) and contract assets for the particular future periods. _Financial liabilities at amortised cost_ The general accounting policies for the respective financial liabilities are presented in the notes below. _Offsetting (netting) of financial instruments_ Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position, if a legally enforceable right exists to offset the recognised amounts and if there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. This requirement results from the concept of the actual economic nature of the Group’s relations with a given counterparty stating that in the simultaneous presence of these two requirements the expected actual future cash flow and benefits for the Group is the net flow, i.e. the net amount reflects the Group’s actual right and obligation resulting from these financial instruments—in all cases to only receive or pay the net amount. If the two conditions are not simultaneously met, it is assumed that the Group’s rights and obligations with respect to these offsetting financial instruments are not exhausted in all situations by only the payment or receipt of the net amount. The offsetting policy is also related to the measurement, presentation and management of actual credit risk and the liquidity risk pursuant from these offsetting instruments. The criteria applied to establish the “current and legally enforceable entitlement to offsetting” are: - lack of dependence on a future event, i.e. it should not only be applicable upon the occurrence of a future event; - the offsetting should be enforceable and legally defendable during (cumulatively): —the Company’s usual business operations; —in case of default/delay, and —in case of insolvency. The applicability of criteria is measured against the requirements of the Bulgarian legislation and the contractual relations between the parties. The condition of “presence of current and legally enforceable right to offsetting”is always and mandatorily assessed together with the second condition—for “mandatory settling of these instruments on a net basis”. The Group applies netting with respect to financial assets and liabilities with other domestic and foreign communications operators. - cash flow hedges, whereas the exposure to variability of cash flows due to a specific risk related to a recognised asset or liability or to a very probable forecast transaction, or to a currency risk related to an unrecognized irrevocable commitment; - hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation. At the inception of the hedge there is formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship and the Group ‘s risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the hedged risk, and the methods how the Group assess hedging relation for hedge effectiveness (including analysis of the sources of ineffectiveness of the hedging and how the hedge ratio has been determined). A hedging relation meets the requirements for hedge accounting if the three effectiveness requirements listed below have been satisfied: - there is an “economic relationship” between the hedged item and the hedging instrument; - the effect of credit risk does not “dominate the value changes” that result from that economic relationship; - the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the entity actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the entity actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item. Hedges that meet all criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for using the methods described herein below: _Fair value hedges_ The change in the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised within the respective item in the statement of comprehensive income (within profit or loss for the year). The change in the fair value of the hedge position pursuant from the hedged risk is carried as a portion of the carrying amount of the hedged item and is also recognised within the respective item in the statement of comprehensive income (within profit or loss for the year). In case of fair value hedges of items measured at amortised cost, any adjustment to the carrying amount shall be amortised through profit or loss for the hedge period remaining to maturity, using the effective interest method. Amortisation by means of effective interest may commence as soon as adjustments are made and not later than the point of discontinuing the hedged item’s correlation as a result of fair value changes pursuant from the hedged risk. If the hedged item is derecognised, the unamortized fair value is immediately recognised in the statement of comprehensive income (within profit or loss for the year). When an unrecognised firm commitment has been designated as a hedged item, the subsequent cumulative change in the fair value of the firm commitment pursuant from the hedged risk shall be recognised as asset or liability by accounting for the respective gains or losses in the statement of comprehensive income (within profit or loss for the year). The Group has no outstanding transactions classified as fair value hedges. _Cash flow hedges_ The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective is recognised in other comprehensive income, respectively in the cash flow hedge reserve, while the hedge ineffectiveness is immediately recognised in profit or loss. The cash flow hedge reserve is adjusted for reduction in the cumulative gains or losses of the hedging instrument and the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedged item. ----- The Group uses currency forwards to hedge its currency risk exposure in forecast transactions and firm commitments. The ineffective portion of currency contracts is recognised within “finance costs”. Moreover, it uses interest rate swaps and interest rate cap options. The Group only designates the spot component of forward contracts as a hedging instrument. The forward component is recognised either: a) in profit or loss, or b) in other comprehensive income and is accumulated within a separate component of equity, within cost of hedging reserve”. The choice is made on a hedge by hedge basis. The accounting treatment of interest rate swaps and interest rate options is analogous, with the changes in the time value of options recognized only within separate component of equity—“cost of hedging reserve”. The amounts that have been accumulated through other comprehensive income in “cash flow hedge reserve” or “cost of hedging reserve” are accounted for depending on the nature of the underlying hedge transaction. If the hedged transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial item, the amount accumulated in equity is transferred from the respective reserve and is included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability. This is not a reclassification adjustment and hence is not recognised in other comprehensive income for the period. This is also applicable in the cases where the hedged forecast transaction for a non-financial asset or non-financial liability subsequently becomes a firm commitment for which fair value hedge accounting is applied. For all other cash flow hedges, the amount accumulated through other comprehensive income in “cash flow hedge reserve”or “cost of hedging reserve”is reclassified into profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment in the same period during which the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss. If the Group discontinues hedge accounting for a cash flow hedge, the amount accumulated through other comprehensive income in the cash flow hedge reserve is not reclassified if the hedged future cash flows are still expected to occur. Otherwise, the amount is immediately reclassified to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment. Following the discontinuance, upon occurrence of the hedged cash flows, any outstanding amount in the reserve accumulated through other comprehensive income is accounted for depending on the underlying transaction, as described herein above. weighted-average method. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. BTC sells handsets separately and in connection with service contracts. As part of the strategy to acquire new customers, it sells handsets, in connection with certain service contracts, at below their acquisition cost. The loss on the sale of handsets is recognized at the time of the sale and the cost of the handsets is presented as “Materials and consumables expenses” in the profit or loss for the period. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group/Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date. Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the respective assets. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period they occur. the estimated expenses on the employee’s remunerations and the statutory social security contributions due by the employer thereon. A contract asset is recognized if corresponding revenue for fulfilment of a contractual performance obligation is recorded before the customer has paid consideration or before the requirements for billing and thus the recognition of a receivable exist. A contract liability is recognized when the customer has paid consideration or a receivable from the customer is due before the Group or the Company has fulfilled a contractual performance obligation. On a customer contract level, contract liabilities are set off against contract assets. Multiple-element arrangements involving the delivery or provision of multiple products or services are separated into distinct performance obligations, each with its own separate revenue contribution that is recognized as revenue on fulfilment of the obligation to the customer. This is particularly applicable for sale or lease of a mobile handset or other telecom equipment combined with the conclusion of a mobile or fixed telecommunication service contract. The total transaction price of the contract is allocated among the individual performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices. The stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the list prices at which the Group sells the telecommunication services and equipment. For items that are not sold separately, like options providing material right, the Group estimates stand-alone selling prices reflecting the likelihood that the option will be exercised. As a result, the revenue to be recognized for the telecom equipment usually delivered at contract inception and sold at a discounted price in combination with a term service contract is higher than the amount billed. This leads to the recognition of a contract asset in the statement of financial position. The contract asset is reversed and reduced over the remaining minimum contract period, lowering revenue from the other performance obligations in the contract (the telecommunication service). In contrast to the amounts billed, this results in higher revenue from the sale of goods and merchandise and lower revenue from the provision of services. One-time payments by the customer that do not constitute consideration for a separate performance obligation are classified as contract liabilities and are deferred and recognized as revenue over the minimum contract term. This is applicable to fees for installation and set-up activities that do not have an independent value for the customer. Options provided in the contract to the customer to purchase additional goods or services free of charge or at a discount are separate performance obligations (material rights) for which part of the revenue is deferred as a contract liability until the option is exercised or expires. Offers for the purchase of additional products or services at their stand-alone prices are treated as marketing offers and are excluded when determining consideration. Long-term customer receivables arising from sales of telecom equipment on instalments, contract assets arising from sales of a telecom equipment at discount in connection with the conclusion of a term customer contract or contract liabilities arising from a prepayment by the customer are recognized at present value if the financing component is significant in relation to the total contract value, including those performance obligations that do not contain a financing component. Payments to customers, including subsequent discounts are recognized as a reduction in revenue unless the payment constitutes consideration for a distinct good or service acquired from the customer, for which the fair value can be reasonably estimated. The incremental costs of obtaining a contract (mainly sales commission paid to employees and third-party retailers) and the costs to fulfil a contract are capitalized if it can be assumed that the costs will be compensated by future revenue from the contract. Incremental costs of obtaining a contract are additional costs that would have not been incurred had the contract not been concluded. Costs to fulfil a contract are costs relating directly to a contract that are incurred after contract inception and serve the purpose of fulfilling the contract but are incurred prior to fulfilment and cannot be capitalized under any other standard. The capitalized contract costs are presented as other assets in the statement of financial position and recognised in the profit or loss as: 1) depreciation and amortization on a straight-line basis over the minimum enforceable contract period, or 2) other operating expenses when impairment loss is recognized, if their carrying amount exceeds the remaining amount of consideration that the Group expects to receive, less the costs that relate directly to providing the goods or services that have not been recognized as expenses. ----- Principal activities from which the revenues are generated include provision of mobile and fixed voice and data services, broadband internet access, pay TV services (DTH and IPTV), rent of terrestrial network (ducts), TV and radio broadcasting, collocation services, connection and roaming fees billed to other operators, and sales or lease of mobile handsets, other telecommunications equipment, and accessories. Services revenue is recognized upon rendering of the agreed service. Services are usually billed and paid for on a monthly basis. Revenue from non-sales-type rentals and leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Revenue and expenses associated with the sale of telecommunications equipment and accessories are recognized when the products are delivered, provided there are no unfulfilled Group’s/Company’s obligations that affect the customer’s final acceptance of the arrangement. For telecommunications equipment sold separately, customers pay in full at the point of sale. For devices sold on instalments in combination with a term service contract, customers usually pay monthly in equal instalments over a period of 12 or 24 months. The lease liability is subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability (using the effective interest method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made. The Group remeasures the lease liability (and makes a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use asset) whenever: - the lease term has changed or there is a change in the assessment of exercise of a purchase option, in which case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate. - the lease payments change due to changes in an index or rate or a change in expected payment under a guaranteed residual value, in which cases the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using the initial discount rate (unless the lease payments change is due to a change in a floating interest rate, in which case a revised discount rate is used). - a lease contract is modified, and the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, in which case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate. The right-of-use assets comprise the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, lease payments made at or before the commencement day and any initial direct costs. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the shorter period of lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. If a lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group expects to exercise a purchase option, the related right-of-use asset is depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset. The depreciation starts at the commencement date of the lease. The right-of-use assets are presented as a separate line in the consolidated and separate statement of financial position. The Group applies IAS 36 Impairment of Assets to determine whether a right-of-use asset is impaired and accounts for any identified impairment loss as described in Note 2.8. Variable rents that do not depend on an index or rate are not included in the measurement of the lease liability and the right-of-use asset. The related payments are recognised as an expense in the period in which the event or condition that triggers those payments occurs and are included in Other operating expenses in the statement of comprehensive income. The Group applies the practical expedient permitted by IFRS 16 not to separate non-lease components, and instead account for any lease and associated non-lease components as a single arrangement. Payments associated with short-term leases of equipment and leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less without a purchase option. Low-value assets comprise small items of office equipment. Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. When a contract includes lease and non-lease components, the Group applies IFRS 15 to allocate the consideration under the contract to each component.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Monetary assets and liabilities, denominated in foreign currency at 31 December, are translated at the closing exchange rate of BNB as at that date. The foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at period-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income as “finance income/costs”at the moment when they arise, except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges. Financial instruments denominated in foreign currency as at 31 December are reported in these financial statements at the closing exchange rate of BNB. Non-monetary reporting items in the statement of financial position, which have been denominated in a foreign currency on initial recognition, are recorded in the functional currency by applying the historical exchange rate of BNB at the date of the transaction and are not subsequently revalued at closing exchange rate. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

The Group initially measures financial assets at fair value, and in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit and loss, the transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset are added. Exceptions to this rule are trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component—they are measured based on the transaction price determined under IFRS 15 and the invoice issued. The purchases and sales of financial assets whose conditions require asset delivery within a certain period, usually pursuant to legislation or the effective practice of the respective market (mostly the Bulgarian one) (regular way purchases), are recognized using trade date accounting, i.e. on the date when the Company committed to purchase or sell the asset. The classification of financial assets upon their initial recognition depends on the characteristics of: a) the contractual cash flows of the respective financial asset, and b) the Group’s business model for management thereof. In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income, its conditions should give rise to cash flows that are “solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)” on the principal amount outstanding. For this purpose, analysis is performed by means of SPPI test at instrument level. The Group’s business model for the management of financial assets reflects the way the Group manages its financial assets to generate cash flows. The business model determines if cash flows are generated by the collection of contractual cash flows, the sale of financial assets, or both. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

If this rate cannot be readily determined, which is generally the case for leases in the Group, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions. To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Group uses a build-up approach that starts with a risk-free interest rate adjusted for credit risk for the country and the Company and makes adjustments specific to the lease, e.g. term, currency and security. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise: - fixed lease payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives; - variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the commencement date; - the amount expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees; - the exercise price of purchase options, if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the options; and - payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the exercise of an option to terminate the lease. The lease liability is presented as Borrowings and lease liabilities in the consolidated and separate statement of financial position. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases. When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for the head lease and the sublease as two separate contracts. The sublease is classified as a finance or operating lease by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease. Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recognised as receivables at the amount of the Group’s net investment in the leases. Finance lease income is allocated to reporting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the Group’s net investment outstanding in respect of the leases. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Since the companies within BTC Group use mainly BGN and EUR as operating currencies they are not significantly exposed to currency risk. Most of the income is generated in BGN while long term and revolving financing, interest payments and part of the capital expenses are in EUR. This mismatch has not been a problem for the past years as the Bulgarian lev is pegged to the euro. At the same time the stability of the currency board needs to be monitored closely since a potential free floating of the local currency and devaluation of the BGN will significantly affect the financial situation of the Group. Due to forecasted purchases of equipment, satellite capacity and rights for tv providers the Group/Company identified currency risk, arising as a result of certain exposure to the USD. According to the Treasury policy of the Group/Company and in compliance with its foreign exchange risk management strategy, the foreign exchange risk arising from these highly probable forecasted purchases may be hedged. The hedges are cash flow hedges and are classified as financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. When significant foreign currency exposure arises, the Group/Company takes into account the following factors: - Future outlook on volatility of financial market variables. These are modelled by Treasury and in accordance with best practice analytical techniques and economic models - effect of the given foreign exchange exposure on total Group/Company financial results - cost of foreign exchange exposure hedging BTC’s Treasury department mainly uses forward contracts to hedge foreign exchange risk.

Contingent liabilities are not recognized because their existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group. Contingent liabilities are assessed continually to determine whether an outflow of resource embodying economic benefits has become probable. If it becomes probable that an outflow of future economic benefits will be required for an item previously dealt with as a contingent liability, a provision is recognized in the financial statements for the period in which the change in probability occurs. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Accordingly, no liability or provision has been recognized as at December 31, 2020, unless otherwise disclosed. These issues are expected to be resolved by the competent court after considering all arguments set out by BTC group companies. through other comprehensive income, derivative contracts used for hedging at fair value through profit or loss, investment property, loans granted or borrowings received to/from third or related parties, certain trade and other receivables and payables, finance lease receivables and payables, etc. and b) on a non-recurrent (periodic) basis—non-financial assets such as property, plant and equipment. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in a common transaction between independent market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is an exit price and is based on the assumption that the sale transaction will take place either in the principal market for this asset or liability or in the absence of a principal market—in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. Both the designated as a principal market and the most advantageous market are markets to which the Group must have an access. Fair value is measured from the perspective of using the assumptions and judgments that potential market participants would use when pricing the respective asset or liability assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. In measuring the fair value of non-financial assets the starting point is always the assumption what would be the highest and best use of the particular asset for the market participants. The Group applies various valuation techniques that would be relevant to the specific features of the respective conditions and for which it has sufficient available inputs while trying to use at a maximum the publicly observable information, and respectively, to minimize the use of unobservable information. It uses the three acceptable approaches—the market approach, the income approach and the cost approach—whereas the most frequently applied valuation techniques include directly quoted and/or adjusted quoted market prices, market comparables (analogues) and discounted cash flows, including based on capitalised rental income. All assets and liabilities that are measured and/or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value, are categorised within the following fair value hierarchy, namely: - Level 1—Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; - Level 2—Valuation techniques that use inputs other than directly quoted prices but are observable, either directly or indirectly, including where the quoted prices are subject to significant adjustments; and - Level 3—Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable. For assets and liabilities that are recognised at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines at the end of each reporting period whether transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy are deemed to be made for a particular asset or liability depending on the inputs available and used at that date. The Group uses the expertise of external certified valuators to determine the fair value of the following assets and liabilities: derivative hedge instruments Level 2 and Level 3 investment properties, investments in equity instruments not quoted on an active market, property, plant and equipment. The choice of such valuators is made on an annual basis using the following criteria: applied professional standards, professional experience and knowledge, reputation and market status. When the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities carried in the statement of financial position cannot be obtained based on quoted prices on active markets, their fair value is determined by using other valuation models and techniques, including the discounted cash flows model. The input used in these models is obtained from observable markets, where possible, but when this cannot be done, significant judgement is applied to determine fair values. Such judgement involves the review, analysis and assessment of input, for instance regarding liquidity risk, credit risk, and volatility. The changes in assumptions for these factors may impact the amount of the fair value of financial instruments In determining the lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination options) are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated). If there are significant penalties to terminate (or not extend), or any leasehold improvements are expected to have a significant remaining value, the Group is typically reasonably certain to extend (or not terminate). Other factors including historical lease durations and the costs and business disruption required to replace the leased asset are also considered. For lease contracts with indefinite term or short-term technical site rentals the Group estimates the length of the contract to be equal to the economic useful life of non-current assets located in the leased property. The lease term is reassessed if an option is actually exercised (or not exercised) or the Group becomes obliged to exercise (or not exercise) it. The assessment of reasonable certainty is only revised if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs, which affects this assessment, and that is within the control of the lessee. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted by using the rate implicit in the lease. If this rate cannot be readily determined, which is generally the case for leases in the Group, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions. To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Group uses a build-up approach that starts with a risk-free interest rate adjusted for credit risk for the country and the Company and makes adjustments specific to the lease, e.g. term, currency and security. Potential prolonged recession and a deepening crisis could impact on growth prospects, customer spending and collection, and may result in assumptions and estimates that could trigger material adjustments to the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the future. In particular, management expects the assumptions and estimates used in determining impairment of Trade and other receivables, Contract assets, Property, plant and equipment, Intangible assets, Right-of-use assets and valuation of Investment property, and the related Deferred tax assets and liabilities to be affected.

In November 2013 BTC announced the successful completion of its debut bond offering of EUR 400 million 6[5]∕8 % Senior Secured Notes due 2018 on the Irish Stock Exchange pursuant to Rule 144A / Regulation S (the “Notes”). The interest on the Notes was payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing May 15, 2014. In relation to the admission of the Notes the Company received a credit rating of B1 by Moody’s and BB- by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services.

On 4 July 2016, Empreno Ventures Limited commenced legal proceedings in Bulgaria, challenging the validity of the first supplemental indenture (as referred in Note 16). Following the review on three instances, the Bulgarian courts finally dismissed the case on 16 March 2017 and the claim was rejected. On 26 August 2016, LIC Telecommunications S.à r.l. commenced legal proceedings in Luxembourg that, among other things, challenge the validity of the first supplemental indenture (as disclosed in Note 16) and claim damages amounting to EUR 62 million. In 2018 and 2019 judgments were rendered by two instance courts in Luxembourg which declared the request of LIC Telecommunications S.à r.l inadmissible and declined jurisdiction, which entered into force during the reporting period. The transactions for assignment of receivables on cash deposits in Corporate Commercial Bank AD—in bankruptcy (CCB), were executed in 2014 as per the provisions of the applicable law. One of the assigned receivables was utilised by NURTS Bulgaria EAD in order to set-off its obligations to CCB under a bond issued by NURTS Bulgaria EAD in 2013. CCB held 25,723 bonds with a nominal of EUR 1,000 each and in September 2014 NURTS Bulgaria EAD has set-off the principal in the amount of BGN 50,310 and applicable interest due to CCB in the amount of BGN 1,350 thousand against its own cash held in CCB accounts and -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Contingencies (continued)",1136.263.1,,"assigned CCB cash receivables from third parties, including BTC. Despite of the validly executed transactions, the receivers of CCB have recognized only partially the set-off from NURTS Bulgaria EAD (BGN 1,543 thousand) where the remaining amount of BGN 50,117 thousand and other owned cash in CCB of BGN 116 thousand was included in the list of accepted receivables of CCB creditors. No financial assets or liabilities in relation to this matter were recognized in these financial statements. On 2 May 2017 NURTS Bulgaria EAD was notified for commencement by CCB of legal proceedings for the challenge of the set-off. On 14 May 2018 the first instance court cast a decision, as a result of which the NURTS set-offs against CCB were declared partially null and void and partially invalid vis-à-vis the creditors of CCB. The decision has not entered into force and has been appealed before the Sofia Court of Appeal. On 12 December 2019 CCB has withdrawn its claim against NURTS and on 20 December 2019 has initiated a procedure for the sale of the bonds held by CCB within which the above-referred issues between CCB and NURTS were finally resolved during the reporting period. Accordingly, a provision was recognized by NURTS in 2019. As a consequence, the bonds and NURTS respectively were deregistered from the public register for issuers of securities maintained by the Bulgarian Financial Supervision Commission. During the reporting period NURTS Bulgaria AD was served with documents relating to a case that has been filed by the administrators of CCB against NURTS Bulgaria EAD claiming the return of certain assets originating from CCB. As the purported limitation period for filing such claims has expired and NURTS Bulgaria EAD has already settled all CCB claims, management believes that any chance of transfer of benefits with regards to this case to be remote and no provision has been recognised in these financial statements. NURTS Bulgaria EAD was notified by CCB that pursuant to a contract concluded on January 16, 2013 the company has stepped in as co-debtor in third party’s obligation in the amount of EUR 12,300 thousand (BGN 24,057 thousand). The management of the company underwent a process of confirmation of the relevant circumstances, including it has asked the receivers of CCB for provision of information, and as a result as per the date of the present financial statements no reliable and indisputable evidences were received for the existence of such contingent liability, nor for its exact amount (if such liability exists). Respectively, no liability or provision has been recognized as at December 31, 2019, and contingent liability was disclosed. During the reporting period NURTS Bulgaria EAD has acquired the above referred third party’s obligations towards CCB and thus, any contingent liability is deemed unenforceable and extinguished. Based on the information available, management is satisfied that there is no unprovided liability arising from these lawsuits and administrative proceedings, however there are inherent uncertainties related to the outcome of the cases. The recognised provisions for lawsuits are further disclosed in Note 15. The Group has bank guarantees issued to third parties which amount to BGN 10,412 thousand as of 31 December 2020 (2019: BGN 2,738 thousand).

During 2019 CRC decided to deregulated access to ducts provided by BTC after a transitional period of 1 year as from the publications of the General Terms and conditions according to LECNPI. At the end of July, 2015 BTC’s permission was amended again after replacing the assigned frequency bands and providing additional spectrum BTC was granted the right to use the following spectrum: - 1965-1980 MHz (total of 15 MHz) - 2155-2170 MHz (total of 15 MHz) In Q22016 CRC assigned to BTC additional spectrum of 2x5 MHz in 1800 MHz.

The fees are regulated by the CRC and relevant Council of Ministers Ordinances. - Mobile telecommunications In June 2004 the Communications Regulation Commission (CRC) granted BTC the license for building, exploitation and maintenance of a cellular mobile telecommunications network under the GSM standard with national coverage. The issued license is valid for the period of 20 years and granted the right of using radio frequency 900 and 1 800 MHz. BTC paid BGN 54,160 thousand for the GSM license.

Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results may differ from those estimates (Note 4). - Initial application of new amendments to the existing standards effective for the current reporting period The following amendments to the existing standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and adopted by the EU are effective for the current reporting period: - IFRS 16 “Leases”—adopted by the EU on October 31, 2017 (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019), - Amendments to IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”—Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation— adopted by the EU on March 22, 2018 (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019), - Amendments to IAS 19 “Employee Benefits”—Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement—adopted by the EU on March 13, 2019 (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019), - Amendments to IAS 28 “Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures”—Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures—adopted by the EU on February 8, 2019 (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019), - Amendments to various standards due to “Improvements to IFRSs (cycle 2015-2017)” resulting from the annual improvement project of IFRS (IFRS 3, IFRS 11, IAS 12 and IAS 23) primarily with a view to removing inconsistencies and clarifying wording—adopted by the EU on March 14, 2019 (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019), - IFRIC 23 “Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments”—adopted by the EU on October 23, 2018 (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019). The Group had to change its accounting policy and make certain adjustments following the adoption of IFRS 16, as disclosed below. The adoption of the other amendments to the existing standards and interpretation has not led to any material changes in these financial statements. Under IFRS 16, lessors continue to make distinction between operating lease and finance lease as previously under IAS 17, while lessees are required to recognize assets and liabilities for principally all leases in the statement of financial position. Summary of the performed impact assessment is presented below. The Group has adopted the new standard on the required effective date retrospectively but has not restated comparatives for the 2018 reporting period, as permitted under the specific transitional provisions in the standard. The reclassifications and the adjustments arising from the new leasing rules are therefore recognised in the opening balance sheet on 1 January 2019. On transition to IFRS 16, the Group recognised additional BGN 258,934 thousand of right of use assets (Note 11) and BGN 259,661 thousand lease liabilities (Note 16) and the Company—respectively BGN 294,146 thousand and BGN 294,874 thousand. Equity is not impacted as the right-of-use asset is measured at an amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments relating to that lease recognized in the statement of financial position immediately before the date of initial application. Amortization of the right-of-use assets and interest costs on the lease obligation are recognized in the statements of comprehensive income instead of operating expense under the previous lease standard. Classification of lease payments in the statement of cash flows is also affected by the requirements of the new lease standard: a significant portion of the lease payments recognized as cash flows from operating activities in the statement of cash flows previously, are classified as cash flows from financing activities upon application of the new lease accounting requirements. Accounting policy elated to leases is presented in Note 2.22. ----- The Group’s lease portfolio mainly consists of administrative and commercial buildings, fixed and mobile site rentals, network infrastructure, software and vehicles. Main assumptions applied in determining the values of the lease liability and right-of-use asset include the assessment of the lease term and the appropriate discount rate. The lease term is impacted by the assessment of the reasonably certain criterion in respect of renewal or termination options. For lease contracts with indefinite term or short term technical site rentals the Group estimates the length of the contract to be equal to the economic useful life of non-current assets located in the leased property. The same economic useful life is applied to determine the depreciation rate of right-of-use assets. The Group’s incremental borrowing rate, taking into account the expected term of the leases is applied for discounting the future payment obligations. As of 1 January 2019 the weighted-average rate is 4.99%. For significant judgements related to leases, see Note 4 k). The following options and practical expedients were exercised by the Group on transition to the new requirements: - Single discount rate is applied to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics such as lease term, class of underlying asset and currency. - Initial direct costs are excluded from the measurement of the right-of use asset at the date of initial application. - A distinction is not made in leases that contain both lease components and non-lease components. Each lease component is accounted for together with other related performance components as a single lease component. - The Group has not applied the practical expedient that allows to avoid reassessing whether a contract is, or contains, a lease at the date of initial application of IFRS 16. Besides the contracts identified as leases under the previous accounting standard, the new requirements are applied to certain contracts that were previously treated as supply of service (such as collocation and satellite capacity agreements, where entire satellite transponder is being rented). - Amendments to IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”, IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement” and IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments: Disclosures”—Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020). - New Standards and amendments to the existing Standards issued by IASB but not yet adopted by the EU: At present, IFRS as adopted by the EU do not significantly differ from regulations adopted by the IASB except from the following new standards and amendments to the existing standards, which were not endorsed for use in EU as at 23.04.2020 (the effective dates stated below is for IFRS in full): - IFRS 14 “Regulatory Deferral Accounts” (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016)—the European Commission has decided not to launch the endorsement process of this interim standard and to wait for the final standard, - IFRS 17 “Insurance Contracts” (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021), - Amendments to IFRS 3 “Business Combinations”—Definition of a Business (effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after 1 January 2020 and to asset acquisitions that occur on or after the beginning of that period), - Amendments to IFRS 10 “Consolidated Financial Statements”and IAS 28 “Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures”—Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture and further amendments (effective date deferred indefinitely until the research project on the equity method has been concluded), - Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current (issued on 23 January 2020). Unless otherwise described above, the Group and the Company anticipate that the adoption of these standards and amendments to the existing standards will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group and the Company in the period of initial application. Revaluation of land is performed by independent certified appraisers usually every three years. When there is an indication of material changes in their fair value in shorter intervals, the revaluation may be performed at shorter intervals. Increases in the carrying amount arising on revaluation of land are credited to revaluation reserves in shareholder’s equity. As disclosed in Note 2.8 decreases that offset previous increases of the same asset are charged against revaluation reserves directly in equity. All other decreases are charged to the profit or loss for the period as other operating expenses. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are measured at fair value in the consolidated financial statements, which is also the ultimate parent’s group policy. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment properties are included in profit or loss under “Other gains, net” in the period in which they arise. The chosen approach for subsequent measurement of investment properties for the Company is the cost model under IAS 16, i.e. cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses in value. Investment properties (excluding Land) are depreciated by using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life which is determined to be 25 years. An investment property is derecognised upon disposal or when the investment property is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits are expected from the disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the property (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in profit or loss in the period in which the property is derecognised. Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest method. They are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss upon asset disposal, modification or impairment. The Group’s financial assets at amortised cost may include: cash and cash equivalents at banks, trade receivables and other receivables, loans to related parties and loans to third parties, corporate bonds (potentially). They are presented within the following items in the statement of financial position: cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and investments. _Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (debt instruments) (based on past experience, for future transactions)_ The Group measures its debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income, when both of the following conditions have been satisfied: - the financial asset is held and used within the business model, for the purpose of both collecting contractual cash flows and selling it; and - the conditions of the financial asset contract give rise to cash flows on specific dates, which constitute solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding. With respect to debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income, the interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment losses, including their reversal, are recognised in profit or loss and are calculated in the same manner as the one applied for financial assets measured at amortised cost. The other changes in fair value are recognised through other comprehensive income in fair value reserve. Upon derecognition, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified (recycled) from equity to profit or loss. The Group’s debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income may include: investments in quoted debt instruments (corporate bonds), which are stated within the “long-term investments” item in the statement of financial position. _Financial instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (equity instruments)_ At the time of initial recognition, the Group may make an irrevocable election to account for the equity investments at fair value through other comprehensive income, but only if they meet the equity definition under IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation, and are not held for trading. The classification is determined at the level of individual instruments. The Group usually makes an irrevocable election to classify into this category minority equity investments, which it holds in the long-term and in relation to its business interests in these entities. They are presented in the statement of financial position within “investments”. The minority interest of BTC in: Viva Telecom Bulgaria, Sofia Stock Exchange and Intersputnik (Russia) is classified within these equity instruments. Upon derecognition of these assets, gains and losses from remeasurement to fair value, recognised in other comprehensive income, are not reclassified (recycled) to profit or loss. Dividends are recognised as “finance income”in profit or loss when the right to receive payment is established, unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of an investment—in this case gains are recognised in other comprehensive income. Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are not subject to impairment tests. _Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (based on past experience, for future transactions)_ Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include: financial assets designated upon their initial recognition as “at fair value through profit or loss”, or financial assets for which a mandatory requirement exists to be measured at fair value. Derivatives, including individual embedded derivates, are also classified as held for trading, unless they have been designated as effective hedging instruments. ----- Irrespective of the criteria for debt instruments which should be classified at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income as described above, debt instruments may be designated as “at fair value through profit or loss”upon their initial recognition, if this would eliminate or reduce a significant accounting mismatch. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are measured in the statement of financial position at fair value, with net changes in the fair value recognised in profit or loss. This category includes derivative instruments, as well as equity instruments registered for trade on stock exchanges, with respect to which the Group has not made an irrevocable election to be accounted for at fair value through other comprehensive income. Dividends from such equity instruments are also recognised within “finance income” in profit or loss when the right to receive payment is established. A derivative embedded in a hybrid contract containing a host that is financial liability or a non-financial item is separated from the host and accounted for as a separate instrument, if: the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host; a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative; and the hybrid contract is not measured at fair value through profit or loss. Embedded derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes therein are recognised in profit or loss. Remeasurement is only done if there is either a change in the contractual conditions that materially modifies the cash flows that would otherwise be required, or if there is reclassification of a financial asset outside the category of fair value through profit or loss. A derivative embedded in a hybrid contract whose host is a financial asset is not accounted for separately. The requirement is the host—financial asset, together with the embedded derivative, to be classified in its entirety as a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss. _Derecognition_ A financial asset (or, when applicable, a portion of a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised from the Group’s statement of financial position, when: - the rights to cash flows from the asset have expired, or - the rights to cash flows from the asset have been transferred or the Group has assumed an obligation to pay in full the cash flows received, without undue delay, to a third party under a transfer agreement, in which: a) the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards from ownership of the asset; or b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all risks and rewards from ownership of the asset, but has transferred control thereon. When the Group has transferred its right to obtain cash flows from the asset or has concluded a transfer agreement, it assesses the extent to which it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When the Group has neither transferred, nor retained substantially all risks and rewards from ownership of the financial assets, it continues to recognise the asset transferred to the extent of its continuing interest therein. In this case, the Group also recognises the respective liability. The transferred asset and the related liability are measured on a basis reflecting the rights and obligations that the Group has retained. Continuing involvement in the form of a guarantee on the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the two values: the initial carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group may be required to pay. _Impairment of financial assets_ The Group recognises an allowance (impairment provision) for expected credit losses for all debt instruments which are not carried at fair value through profit or loss. Expected credit losses are calculated as the difference between the contractual cash flows due under the contractual conditions, and all cash flows the Group expects ----- to receive, discounted at the initial effective interest rate. Expected cash flows also include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that constitute an integral part of the contractual conditions. _Loans to related and third parties, other significant individual receivables and cash and cash equivalents. Financial guarantees_ To calculate the expected credit losses from loans to related and third parties, other significant individual receivables, incl. cash and cash equivalents at banks, the Group applies the general impairment approach defined by IFRS 9. Under this approach, the Group applies a 3-stage impairment model based on changes versus the initial recognition of the credit quality of the financial instrument (asset). The categorization used by the Group to assess the credit risk related to loans, financial guarantees, and other individual receivables, is as follows: All financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value, and in the case of loans and borrowings and trade and other payables, net of direct transaction costs. The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings, including bank overdrafts, bond loans (if any), derivative financial instruments and lease liabilities. _Subsequent measurement_ The subsequent measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification. _Classification groups Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss_ Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading, and financial liabilities initially measured at fair value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they have been acquired for the purpose of repeated purchase in the near future. This category includes derivative financial instruments held by the Group which have not been designated as hedging instruments in the hedge relations pursuant to the IFRS 9 definition. Separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading, unless designated as effective hedging instruments. Gains and losses from financial liabilities held for trading are recognised in profit or loss under the “finance income/finance costs” item. Financial liabilities initially measured at fair value through profit or loss are identified as such at the date of initial recognition only if the IFRS 9 criteria are met. The Group has not classified any of its financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. _Financial liabilities at amortised cost_ The general accounting policies for the respective financial liabilities are presented in the notes below. _Offsetting (netting) of financial instruments_ Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position, if a legally enforceable right exists to offset the recognised amounts and if there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. This requirement results from the concept of the actual economic nature of the Group’s relations with a given counterparty stating that in the simultaneous presence of these two requirements the expected actual future cash flow and benefits for the Group is the net flow, i.e. the net amount reflects the Group’s actual right and obligation resulting from these financial instruments—in all cases to only receive or pay the net amount. If the two conditions are not simultaneously met, it is assumed that the Group’s rights and obligations with respect to these offsetting financial instruments are not exhausted in all situations by only the payment or receipt of the net amount. The offsetting policy is also related to the measurement, presentation and management of actual credit risk and the liquidity risk pursuant from these offsetting instruments. The criteria applied to establish the “current and legally enforceable entitlement to offsetting” are: - lack of dependence on a future event, i.e. it should not only be applicable upon the occurrence of a future event; ----- - the offsetting should be enforceable and legally defendable during (cumulatively): - the Company’s usual business operations; - in case of default/delay, and - in case of insolvency. The applicability of criteria is measured against the requirements of the Bulgarian legislation and the contractual relations between the parties. The condition of “presence of current and legally enforceable right to offsetting”is always and mandatorily assessed together with the second condition—for “mandatory settling of these instruments on a net basis”. The Group applies netting with respect to financial assets and liabilities with other domestic and foreign communications operators. pursuant from the hedged risk is carried as a portion of the carrying amount of the hedged item and is also recognised within the respective item in the statement of comprehensive income (within profit or loss for the year). In case of fair value hedges of items measured at amortised cost, any adjustment to the carrying amount shall be amortised through profit or loss for the hedge period remaining to maturity, using the effective interest method. Amortisation by means of effective interest may commence as soon as adjustments are made and not later than the point of discontinuing the hedged item’s correlation as a result of fair value changes pursuant from the hedged risk. If the hedged item is derecognised, the unamortized fair value is immediately recognised in the statement of comprehensive income (within profit or loss for the year). When an unrecognised firm commitment has been designated as a hedged item, the subsequent cumulative change in the fair value of the firm commitment pursuant from the hedged risk shall be recognised as asset or liability by accounting for the respective gains or losses in the statement of comprehensive income (within profit or loss for the year). The Group has no outstanding transactions classified as fair value hedges. _Cash flow hedges_ The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective is recognised in other comprehensive income, respectively in the cash flow hedge reserve, while the hedge ineffectiveness is immediately recognised in profit or loss. The cash flow hedge reserve is adjusted for reduction in the cumulative gains or losses of the hedging instrument and the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedged item. The Group uses currency forwards to hedge its currency risk exposure in forecast transactions and firm commitments. The ineffective portion of currency contracts is recognised within “finance costs”. Moreover, it uses interest rate swaps and interest rate cap options. The Group only designates the spot component of forward contracts as a hedging instrument. The forward component is recognised either: a) in profit or loss, or b) in other comprehensive income and is accumulated within a separate component of equity, within cost of hedging reserve”. The choice is made on a hedge by hedge basis. The accounting treatment of interest rate swaps and interest rate options is analogous, with the changes in the time value of options recognized only within separate component of equity—”cost of hedging reserve”. The amounts that have been accumulated through other comprehensive income in “cash flow hedge reserve” or “cost of hedging reserve” are accounted for depending on the nature of the underlying hedge transaction. If the hedged transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial item, the amount accumulated in equity is transferred from the respective reserve and is included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability. This is not a reclassification adjustment and hence is not recognised in other comprehensive income for the period. This is also applicable in the cases where the hedged forecast transaction for a non-financial asset or non-financial liability subsequently becomes a firm commitment for which fair value hedge accounting is applied. For all other cash flow hedges, the amount accumulated through other comprehensive income in “cash flow hedge reserve”or “cost of hedging reserve”is reclassified into profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment in the same period during which the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss. If the Group discontinues hedge accounting for a cash flow hedge, the amount accumulated through other comprehensive income in the cash flow hedge reserve is not reclassified if the hedged future cash flows are still expected to occur. ----- Otherwise, the amount is immediately reclassified to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment. Following the discontinuance, upon occurrence of the hedged cash flows, any outstanding amount in the reserve accumulated through other comprehensive income is accounted for depending on the underlying transaction, as described herein above. The measurement of provisions is based on the best estimate, made by the management at the reporting date, concerning the expenses that will be incurred for the settlement of the particular obligation. The estimate is discounted if the obligation maturity is long-term. When part of the resources required to settle the obligation is expected to be recovered from a third party, the Group recognises a receivable if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received, and its amount can be reliably measured. Income is recognised in the same category of the profit or loss for the period where the creations of the provision is charged. contract or contract liabilities arising from a prepayment by the customer are recognized at present value if the financing component is significant in relation to the total contract value, including those performance obligations that do not contain a financing component. Payments to customers, including subsequent discounts are recognized as a reduction in revenue unless the payment constitutes consideration for a distinct good or service acquired from the customer, for which the fair value can be reasonably estimated. The incremental costs of obtaining a contract (mainly sales commission paid to employees and third-party retailers) and the costs to fulfill a contract are capitalized if it can be assumed that the costs will be compensated by future revenue from the contract. Incremental costs of obtaining a contract are additional costs that would have not been incurred had the contract not been concluded. Costs to fulfill a contract are costs relating directly to a contract that are incurred after contract inception and serve the purpose of fulfilling the contract but are incurred prior to fulfillment and cannot be capitalized under any other standard. The capitalized contract costs are presented as other assets in the statement of financial position and recognised in the profit or loss as: 1) depreciation and amortization on a straight-line basis over the minimum enforceable contract period, or 2) other operating expenses when impairment loss is recognized, if their carrying amount exceeds the remaining amount of consideration that the Group expects to receive, less the costs that relate directly to providing the goods or services that have not been recognized as expenses. Principal activities from which the revenues are generated include provision of mobile and fixed voice and data services, broadband internet access, pay TV services (DTH and IPTV), rent of terrestrial network (ducts), TV and radio broadcasting, collocation services, connection and roaming fees billed to other operators, and sales or lease of mobile handsets, other telecommunications equipment, and accessories. Services revenue is recognized upon rendering of the agreed service. Services are usually billed and paid for on a monthly basis. Revenue from non-sales-type rentals and leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Revenue and expenses associated with the sale of telecommunications equipment and accessories are recognized when the products are delivered, provided there are no unfulfilled Group’s/Company’s obligations that affect the customer’s final acceptance of the arrangement. For telecommunications equipment sold separately, customers pay in full at the point of sale. For devices sold on lease in combination with a term service contract, customers usually pay monthly in equal instalments over a period of 12 or 24 months. determined, which is generally the case for leases in the Group, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions. To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Group uses a build-up approach that starts with a risk-free interest rate adjusted for credit risk for the country and the Company and makes adjustments specific to the lease, e.g. term, currency and security. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise: - fixed lease payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives; - variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the commencement date; - the amount expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees; - the exercise price of purchase options, if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the options; and - payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the exercise of an option to terminate the lease. The lease liability is presented as Borrowings and lease liabilities in the consolidated and separate statement of financial position. The lease liability is subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability (using the effective interest method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made. The Group remeasures the lease liability (and makes a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use asset) whenever: - the lease term has changed or there is a change in the assessment of exercise of a purchase option, in which case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate. - the lease payments change due to changes in an index or rate or a change in expected payment under a guaranteed residual value, in which cases the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using the initial discount rate (unless the lease payments change is due to a change in a floating interest rate, in which case a revised discount rate is used). - a lease contract is modified, and the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, in which case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate. The right-of-use assets comprise the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, lease payments made at or before the commencement day and any initial direct costs. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the shorter period of lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. If a lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group expects to exercise a purchase option, the related right-of-use asset is depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset. The depreciation starts at the commencement date of the lease. The right-of-use assets are presented as a separate line in the consolidated and separate statement of financial position. The Group applies IAS 36 Impairment of Assets to determine whether a right-of-use asset is impaired and accounts for any identified impairment loss as described in Note 2.8. ----- Variable rents that do not depend on an index or rate are not included in the measurement of the lease liability and the right-of-use asset. The related payments are recognised as an expense in the period in which the event or condition that triggers those payments occurs and are included in Other operating expenses in the statement of comprehensive income. The Group applies the practical expedient permitted by IFRS 16 not to separate non-lease components, and instead account for any lease and associated non-lease components as a single arrangement. unearned finance income. Lease income is recognized over the term of the lease using the net investment method, which reflects a constant periodic rate of return.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Impairment of non-financial assets,1136.354.1,,"The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (CGU) fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the profit or loss for the period as other operating expenses, except for land previously revalued where the revaluation was taken to equity. In this case the impairment is also recognised in equity up to the amount of any previous revaluation. An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses of assets may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group/ Company estimates the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.

The Group initially measures financial assets at fair value, and in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit and loss, the transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset are added. Exceptions to this rule are trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component—they are measured based on the transaction price determined under IFRS 15 and the invoice issued. The purchases and sales of financial assets whose conditions require asset delivery within a certain period, usually pursuant to legislation or the effective practice of the respective market (mostly the Bulgarian one) (regular way purchases), are recognized using trade date accounting, i.e. on the date when the Company committed to purchase or sell the asset. The classification of financial assets upon their initial recognition depends on the characteristics of: a) the contractual cash flows of the respective financial asset, and b) the Group’s business model for management thereof. In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income, its conditions should give rise to cash flows that are “solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)” on the principal amount outstanding. For this purpose, analysis is performed by means of SPPI test at instrument level. The Group’s business model for the management of financial assets reflects the way the Group manages its financial assets to generate cash flows. The business model determines if cash flows are generated by the collection of contractual cash flows, the sale of financial assets, or both. _Subsequent measurement_ For the purpose of subsequent measurement, the Group’s financial assets are classified in four categories: - Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments); - Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income with “recycling” of cumulative gains or losses (applied for debt instruments); - Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income without “recycling” of cumulative gains or losses (equity instruments); - Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss (applied for debt and equity instruments, as well as for derivative instruments under certain conditions and transactions). _Classification groups Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments)_ The Group measures a financial asset at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met: - the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows, and - the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

In this approach, it recognises an allowance (impairment provision) based on lifetime expected credit losses at each reporting date. The Group has developed and applies provisioning matrix(es) based on its historical experience with credit losses, adjusted with expected collection trends and forecast factors specific for the debtors and the economic environment, for which a correlation has been established with the percentage of credit losses. In the provisioning matrixes used to calculate expected credit losses from trade receivables, lease and other receivables, provision rates are based on days past due for groups from different customer segments sharing similar loss models. For BTC Group, such are: corporate and business customers, residential customers and “international connectivity” customers. The Group usually assumes that the date of economic loss from uncollectability occurs 365 days after the first day of delay. This period is studied and historically assessed. The Group does not have a practice of requesting collateral for receivables from clients. Contract assets are considered to have similar risk characteristics as lease receivables under the same contracts and customers.

These derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date of concluding the derivative contract. Following their initial recognition, derivatives continue to be measured at fair valued. They are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive, and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. For the purpose of hedge accounting, each hedge is classified based on its characteristics as: - fair value hedges, whereas the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability or of an unrecognized irrevocable commitment is hedged; - cash flow hedges, whereas the exposure to variability of cash flows due to a specific risk related to a recognised asset or liability or to a very probable forecast transaction, or to a currency risk related to an unrecognized irrevocable commitment; - hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation. At the inception of the hedge there is formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship and the Group ‘s risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the hedged risk, and the methods how the Group assess hedging relation for hedge effectiveness (including analysis of the sources of ineffectiveness of the hedging and how the hedge ratio has been determined). A hedging relation meets the requirements for hedge accounting if the three effectiveness requirements listed below have been satisfied: - there is an “economic relationship” between the hedged item and the hedging instrument; - the effect of credit risk does not “dominate the value changes” that result from that economic relationship; - the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the entity actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the entity actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item.

Revenue recognition,1136.382.1,,"Revenues comprise all revenues from the ordinary business activities of the Group and the Company, including not only the core business but also other recurring sales of goods or rendering of services and income from contractual penalties and default interest. Gains from sales of property, plant and equipment, investment property or intangible assets are not classified as revenue but presented in other gains, net. Revenues are recognized net of value-added tax in accordance with the provision of goods or services, if collectability of the consideration is probable. For service contracts with a continuous service provision, the contractually agreed total consideration is recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the minimum contract term, regardless of the payment pattern. A contract asset is recognized if corresponding revenue for fulfilment of a contractual performance obligation is recorded before the customer has paid consideration or before the requirements for billing and thus the recognition of a receivable exist. A contract liability is recognized when the customer has paid consideration or a receivable from the customer is due before the Group or the Company has fulfilled a contractual performance obligation. On a customer contract level, contract liabilities are set off against contract assets. Multiple-element arrangements involving the delivery or provision of multiple products or services are separated into distinct performance obligations, each with its own separate revenue contribution that is recognized as revenue on fulfilment of the obligation to the customer. This is particularly applicable for sale or lease of a mobile handset or other telecom equipment combined with the conclusion of a mobile or fixed telecommunication service contract. The total transaction price of the contract is allocated among the individual performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices. The stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the list prices at which the Group sells the telecommunication services and equipment. For items that are not sold separately, like options providing material right, the Group estimates stand-alone selling prices reflecting the likelihood that the option will be exercised. As a result, the revenue to be recognized for the telecom equipment usually delivered at contract inception and sold at a discounted price in combination with a term service contract is higher than the amount billed. This leads to the recognition of a contract asset in the statement of financial position. The contract asset is reversed and reduced over the remaining minimum contract period, lowering revenue from the other performance obligations in the contract (the telecommunication service). In contrast to the amounts billed, this results in higher revenue from the sale of goods and merchandise and lower revenue from the provision of services. One-time payments by the customer that do not constitute consideration for a separate performance obligation are classified as contract liabilities and are deferred and recognized as revenue over the minimum contract term. This is applicable to fees for installation and set-up activities that do not have an independent value for the customer. Options provided in the contract to the customer to purchase additional goods or services free of charge or at a discount are separate performance obligations (material rights) for which part of the revenue is deferred as a contract liability until the option is exercised or expires. Offers for the purchase of additional products or services at their stand-alone prices are treated as marketing offers and are excluded when determining consideration.

Due to the fact that the companies within BTC Group use mainly BGN and EUR as operating currencies they are not significantly exposed to currency risk. Most of the income is generated in BGN while long term and revolving financing, interest payments and part of the capital expenses are in EUR. This mismatch has not been a problem for the past years as the Bulgarian lev is pegged to the euro. At the same time the stability of the currency board needs to be monitored closely since a potential free floating of the local currency and devaluation of the BGN will significantly affect the financial situation of the Group. Due to forecasted purchases of equipment the Group/Company identified currency risk, arising as a result of certain exposure to the USD. According to the Treasury policy of the Group/Company and in compliance with its foreign exchange risk management strategy, the foreign exchange risk arising from these highly probable forecasted purchases may be hedged. The hedges are cash flow hedges and are classified as financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. When significant foreign currency exposure arises, the Group/Company takes into account the following factors: - Future outlook on volatility of financial market variables. These are modelled by Treasury and in accordance with best practice analytical techniques and economic models - effect of the given foreign exchange exposure on total Group/Company financial results - cost of foreign exchange exposure hedging BTC’s Treasury department mainly uses forward contracts to hedge foreign exchange risk.

Accordingly, no liability or provision has been recognized as at December 31, 2019, unless otherwise disclosed. These issues are expected to be resolved by the competent court after considering all arguments set out by BTC group companies. For assets and liabilities that are recognised at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines at the end of each reporting period whether transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy are deemed to be made for a particular asset or liability depending on the inputs available and used at that date. The Group uses the expertise of external certified valuators to determine the fair value of the following assets and liabilities: derivative hedge instruments Level 2 and Level 3, investment properties, investments in equity instruments not quoted on an active market, property, plant and equipment. The choice of such valuators is made on an annual basis using the following criteria: applied professional standards, professional experience and knowledge, reputation and market status. When the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities carried in the statement of financial position cannot be obtained based on quoted prices on active markets, their fair value is determined by using other valuation models and techniques, including the discounted cash flows model. The input used in these models is obtained from observable markets, where possible, but when this cannot be done, significant judgement is applied to determine fair values. Such judgement involves the review, analysis and assessment of input, for instance regarding liquidity risk, credit risk, and volatility. The changes in assumptions for these factors may impact the amount of the fair value of financial instruments assets and liabilities to be affected. At this stage management is not able to reliably estimate the impact as events are unfolding day-by-day. The longer term impact may also affect trading volumes, cash flows and profitability.

The ability of a tangible and intangible asset to generate sufficient future economic benefits to recover its carrying amount is usually subject to greater uncertainty. In performing these assessments of recoverable amount, a significant number of estimates and judgments are required including but not limited to: - An estimate of future cash flows expected to derive from these assets, - Expectations about possible variations in the amount or timing of those future cash flows, - The designation of the cash generating unit for which future cash flows are derived. The cash generating units identified for the Group are: fixed business, mobile business, collocation business and radio and TV broadcasting business - The time value of money represented by weighted average cost of capital (WACC). - Perpetual growth rate (PGR). For the last couple of years prior to 2018, the Group has been conducting annual impairment testing of its assets and no need for impairment has been identified. Taking into account the above and the fact that the Group performs in line with its projections and based on the assessment that no internal or external indicators exist affecting the recoverable amount of the assets or triggering the need for annual impairment test of assets, the Management considers that the carrying amount of the assets as of 31 December 2019 does not exceed their recoverable amount.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Such are: a) on a recurrent (annual) basis—financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, derivative contracts used for hedging at fair value through profit or loss, investment property, loans granted or borrowings received to/from third or related parties, certain trade and other receivables and payables, finance lease receivables and payables, etc. and b) on a non-recurrent (periodic) basis—non-financial assets such as property, plant and equipment. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in a common transaction between independent market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is an exit price and is based on the assumption that the sale transaction will take place either in the principal market for this asset or liability or in the absence of a principal market—in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. Both the designated as a principal market and the most advantageous market are markets to which the Group must have an access. Fair value is measured from the perspective of using the assumptions and judgments that potential market participants would use when pricing the respective asset or liability assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. In measuring the fair value of non-financial assets the starting point is always the assumption what would be the highest and best use of the particular asset for the market participants. The Group applies various valuation techniques that would be relevant to the specific features of the respective conditions and for which it has sufficient available inputs while trying to use at a maximum the publicly observable information, and respectively, to minimize the use of unobservable information. It uses the three acceptable approaches—the market approach, the income approach and the cost approach—whereas the most frequently applied valuation techniques include directly quoted and/or adjusted quoted market prices, market comparables (analogues) and discounted cash flows, including based on capitalised rental income. All assets and liabilities that are measured and/or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value, are categorised within the following fair value hierarchy, namely: - Level 1—Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; - Level 2—Valuation techniques that use inputs other than directly quoted prices but are observable, either directly or indirectly, including where the quoted prices are subject to significant adjustments; and - Level 3—Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

Extension options (or periods after termination options) are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated). If there are significant penalties to terminate (or not extend), or any leasehold improvements are expected to have a significant remaining value, the Group is typically reasonably certain to extend (or not terminate). Other factors including historical lease durations and the costs and business disruption required to replace the leased asset are also considered. For lease contracts with indefinite term or short-term technical site rentals the Group estimates the length of the contract to be equal to the economic useful life of non-current assets located in the leased property. The lease term is reassessed if an option is actually exercised (or not exercised) or the Group becomes obliged to exercise (or not exercise) it. The assessment of reasonable certainty is only revised if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs, which affects this assessment, and that is within the control of the lessee. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted by using the rate implicit in the lease. If this rate cannot be readily determined, which is generally the case for leases in the Group, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions. To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Group uses a build-up approach that starts with a risk-free interest rate adjusted for credit risk for the country and the Company and makes adjustments specific to the lease, e.g. term, currency and security.",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

On 8 June 2015 the Company was informed about an attachment over 43% of the shares of the Company in BTC Net imposed by the Commission for Forfeiture of Illegally Acquired Property. The attachment represents a preliminary securing measure in relation to a claim of the Commission against the former ultimate owner of 43% stake in BTC Mr. Tzvetan Vassilev and other parties, including BTC and Viva Telecom Bulgaria EOOD. On 17 April 2019 a joint venture (Paytech OOD) between BTC and Bulgarian-American Credit Bank AD was registered in the Bulgarian Commercial Register following competition clearance by the Bulgarian Competition Protection Commission granted on 28 March 2019. On 7 October 2019 BTC sold its 50% share in Paytech OOD to Bulgarian-American Credit Bank AD. With a notice dated 6 July 2019 BTC notified Viva Telecom Bulgaria OOD that it terminates its participation as a shareholder in Viva Telecom Bulgaria OOD upon expiry of 4 (four) months as of receipt of the notice. According to the provisions of the Commercial Act the receivable of BTC was determined on the basis of the balance sheet of Viva Telecom Bulgaria OOD as of 30 November 2019, as disclosed in Note 27. The change in the fair value of the investment for the ten months ended 31 October 2019 amounts to BGN 18,412 thousand. The total accumulated fair value reserve, net of tax, as of the date of termination of the participation, amounting to BGN 23,632 thousand was transferred in retained earnings in 2019.

In November 2013 BTC announced the successful completion of its debut bond offering of EUR 400 million 6[5]∕8% Senior Secured Notes due 2018 on the Irish Stock Exchange pursuant to Rule 144A / Regulation S (the “Notes”). The proceeds from the bond offering were used by the Company to repay its existing indebtedness under the amended and restated loan agreement in full. The interest on the Notes was payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing May 15, 2014. In relation to the admission of the Notes the Company received a credit rating of B1 by Moody’s and BB- by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services. On 29 March 2018 and 16 May 2018 respectively, Moody’s upgraded the long-term corporate credit rating of the Company to Ba3 and S&P Global Ratings reconfirmed it as BB- and in November 2019 both agencies placed the corporate credit ratings on review. On 27 March 2020 S&P Global Ratings downgraded the corporate credit rating to B+. BTC underwent a consent solicitation procedure for a waiver of the existing change of control provisions and amendment of certain definitions and ratios applicable to the Notes. The procedure was initiated in relation to the acquisition by VTL of 100% of the shares of InterV Investment S.a.r.l. On 13 June 2016, Vivacom obtained the necessary consent of 87.43% of bondholders. The amendments of Notes’ provisions entered into effect upon the execution of the first supplemental indenture on June 10, 2016 which became operative on 7 September 2016, when all the conditions precedent in the first supplemental indenture were either satisfied or waived. Simultaneously with the bond offering BTC concluded EUR 35 million Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) with Societe Generale Expressbank AD under which the Company may borrow funds for the repayment of its debt under the amended and restated loan agreement, financing of its working capital purposes and issue of bank guarantees and letters of credit. The RCF was initially agreed to be available up to 30 November 2016. The interest on the principal amounts owing by the Company under the RCF is payable monthly and was initially agreed to be the aggregate of 1 month EURIBOR plus a margin of 4% per year. Effective from 26 May 2014 the margin was reduced to 3,75% per year and from 14 November 2016 the margin was further reduced to 1,45% per year and the term was extended to 31 May 2018. On 22 December 2017 the Company entered into an up to EUR 365 million Senior Facilities Agreement (SFA) arranged by Citibank N.A., London Branch and VTB Bank (Deutschland) AG (currently VTB Bank (Europe) SE). The purpose of the facility is to refinance all amounts due under the Existing HY Bonds, payment of fees and costs under the facility and capital expenditure in respect of the Company’s investment and development program. The SFA comprises of a term loan Facility A, term loan Facility B, a Short-term Facility and a Revolving Facility. The maximum tenor is 5.25 years after the first Utilization under the SFA, which occurred on 14 April 2018. The interest on the facilities is based on EURIBOR plus a Margin between 1.25 and 3.75 per cent per annum. The liabilities of the Company under the SFA are guaranteed by BTC Net EOOD (subsidiary) and Viva Telecom Bulgaria EOOD (parent of the Company) and are further secured by: 1) a non-possessory pledge in accordance with the Special Pledges Act on the going concern of the Company, which includes among other receivables of the Company under certain bank accounts, insurance policies, related parties and customer -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,933

On 19 April 2018 the Company successfully completed the refinancing of its Notes ahead of their maturity date and has delisted the Notes from the Official List and from trading on the Main Securities Market of the Irish Stock Exchange. As of the date of these financial statements the Company has deregistered the relevant securities under the Notes. On 14 September 2018 the Company established an Incremental Facility (as defined in the SFA) with incremental commitments totaling EUR 40 million and thus bringing the total SFA borrowings to EUR 365 million. On 25 September 2018 the Short-term Facility outstanding under the SFA in the principal amount of EUR 20 million was prepaid in full. Simultaneously with the SFA the Company extended the maturity of the Existing EUR 35 million Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) with Societe Generale Expressbank AD to 18 April 2021 and reduced the applicable Margin to between 1.05 and 1.75 per cent per annum.

On 4 July 2016, Empreno Ventures Limited commenced legal proceedings in Bulgaria, challenging the validity of the first supplemental indenture (as referred in Note 16). Following the review on three instances, the Bulgarian courts finally dismissed the case on 16 March 2017 and the claim was rejected. On 26 August 2016, LIC Telecommunications S.à r.l. commenced legal proceedings in Luxembourg that, among other things, challenge the validity of the first supplemental indenture (as disclosed in Note 16) and claim damages amounting to EUR 62 million. In 2018 and 2019 judgments were rendered by two instance courts in Luxembourg which declared the request of LIC Telecommunications S.à r.l inadmissible and declined jurisdiction, which entered into force. BTC considers the legal proceedings in both Bulgaria and Luxembourg as being unmeritorious and devoid of any proper legal basis. The transactions for assignment of receivables on cash deposits in Corporate Commercial Bank AD—in bankruptcy (CCB), were executed in 2014 as per the provisions of the applicable law. One of the assigned receivables was utilised by NURTS Bulgaria EAD in order to set-off its obligations to CCB under a bond issued by NURTS Bulgaria EAD in 2013. CCB held 25,723 bonds with a nominal of EUR 1,000 each and in September 2014 NURTS Bulgaria EAD has set-off the principal in the amount of BGN 50,310 and applicable interest due to CCB in the amount of BGN 1,350 thousand against its own cash held in CCB accounts and assigned CCB cash receivables from third parties, including BTC. Despite of the validly executed transactions, the receivers of CCB have recognized only partially the set-off from NURTS Bulgaria EAD (BGN 1,543 thousand) where the remaining amount of BGN 50,117 thousand and other owned cash in CCB of BGN 116 thousand is included in the list of accepted receivables of CCB creditors. No financial assets or liabilities in relation to this matter were recognized in these financial statements. On 2 May 2017 NURTS Bulgaria EAD was notified for commencement by CCB of legal proceedings for the challenge of the set-off. On 14 May 2018 the first instance court cast a decision, as a result of which the NURTS set-offs against CCB were declared partially null and void and partially invalid vis-à-vis the creditors of CCB. The decision has not entered into force and has been appealed before the Sofia Court of Appeal. On 12 December 2019 CCB has withdrawn its claim against NURTS and on 20 December 2019 has initiated a procedure for the sale of the bonds held by CCB within which the above-referred issues between CCB and NURTS were finally resolved after the reporting date. As a result, a provision was recognized by NURTS as disclosed in Note 15. Based on the information available, management is satisfied that there is no unprovided liability arising from the outstanding lawsuits and administrative proceedings, however there are inherent uncertainties related to the outcome of the cases. The recognised provisions for lawsuits are further disclosed in Note 15. The Group has bank guarantees issued to third parties which amount to BGN 2,738 thousand as of 31 December 2018 (2018: BGN 2,359 thousand).

382_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,103,INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT,103.6,Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements,103.6.1,,"Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the separate and consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these separate and consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the separate and consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control. ----- - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. - Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the separate and consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the separate and consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the separate and consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the separate and consolidated financial statements. - We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,933
