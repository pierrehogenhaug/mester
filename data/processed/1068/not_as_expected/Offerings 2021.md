Group Corporation, a Delaware corporation and the parent of the Issuer (“Holdings”), and each and all of Holdings’ current

See “Description of Notes—Guarantees.” The guarantees will be the senior unsecured obligations of the guarantors, will rank
pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior unsecured debt of each such guarantor and will rank senior

subordinated to each guarantors guarantee of the debt outstanding under our Credit Agreement, to the extent of the value of
the assets securing such debt, and will be structurally subordinated to indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade
payables, of Holdings’ non-guarantor subsidiaries.

-----

We obtained the industry, market and competitive position data described or referred to throughout this

While we believe our internal estimates and research are reliable and the market definitions are appropriate,

such estimates, research and definitions have not been verified by any independent source. In particular, some of the
market and industry estimates in this offering circular were prepared prior to the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”)
pandemic, and we cannot predict the extent to which these estimates will be affected. These and other factors could
cause results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the estimates made by independent parties
and by us.

We caution you not to place undue reliance on this data.

**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**

The SEC has adopted rules to regulate the use of “non-GAAP financial measures” that are derived on the

basis of methodologies other than in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In this offering circular and the documents
incorporated by reference herein, we supplement our reporting of consolidated financial information determined in
accordance with U.S. GAAP with non-U.S. GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G of the
Exchange Act. We use certain non-U.S. GAAP financial measures that are included in this offering circular both in
explaining our results to stockholders and the investment community and in our internal evaluation and management
of our businesses. Management believes that these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures and the information they
provide are useful to investors since these measures (a) permit investors to view our performance using the same tools
that management uses to evaluate our past performance, reportable business segments and prospects for future
performance, (b) permit investors to compare us with our peers and (c) determine certain elements of management’s
incentive compensation. Specifically:

    - Adjusted net revenues is defined as net revenues excluding the impact and results of businesses classified
as assets held-for-sale and businesses divested. Management believes that this measure is useful as a
supplement to enable investors to compare period-over-period results on a more consistent basis without
the effects of businesses classified as assets held-for-sale and businesses divested, which more
meaningfully reflects our core ongoing operations and performance. We use adjusted net revenues to
evaluate our performance, both internally and as compared with our peers, because it excludes certain
items that may not be indicative of our core operating results. Adjusted gross profit is defined as gross
profit excluding the impact and results of businesses classified as assets held-for-sale and businesses
divested and certain non-cash and other specifically identified items. Management believes that this
measure is useful as a supplement to enable investors to compare period-over-period results on a more
consistent basis without the effects of businesses classified as assets held-for-sale and businesses
divested, which more meaningfully reflects our core ongoing operations and performance. We use
adjusted gross profit to evaluate our performance, both internally and as compared with our peers,
because it excludes certain items that may not be indicative of our core operating results.

    - Management believes that adjusted net revenues and adjusted gross profit, which are non-GAAP
financial measures that exclude business transformation and other expenses for the integration of
acquired businesses, the impact and results of businesses classified as assets held-for-sale and businesses
divested, and one-time and other events such as impairment charges, share-based compensation,
transaction and other costs related to acquisitions, amortization of intangible assets and depreciation
remeasurements associated with acquisitions, net COVID-19 relief, and certain tax benefits from the
acquisition of APi Group, Inc. (the “APi Acquisition”), are useful because they provide investors with a
meaningful perspective on the current underlying performance of our core ongoing operations.

    - We also present organic changes in net revenues on a segment and consolidated basis to provide a more
complete understanding of underlying revenue trends by providing net revenues on a consistent basis as
it excludes the impacts of material acquisitions, completed divestitures, and changes in foreign currency
from year-over-year comparisons on reported net revenues, calculated as the difference between the
reported net revenues for the current period and reported net revenues for the current period converted
at the prior year average monthly exchange rates (excluding acquisitions and divestitures). The

(v)


-----

completed divestitures.

    - Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) is the measure of profitability
used by management to manage our segments and, accordingly, in our segment reporting. We
supplement the reporting of our consolidated financial information with EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA
and adjusted EBITDA margin. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA excluding the impact of certain
non-cash and other specifically identified items, and adjusted EBITDA margin. Adjusted EBITDA
margin is calculated as adjusted EBITDA divided by adjusted net revenues. We believe these non-U.S.
GAAP measures provide meaningful information and help investors understand our financial results and
assess our prospects for future performance. We use EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA
margin to evaluate our performance, both internally and as compared with our peers, because they
exclude certain items that may not be indicative of our core operating results. Consolidated EBITDA is
calculated in a manner consistent with segment EBITDA, which is a measure of segment profitability.

    - We present free cash flow, adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow conversion, which are
liquidity measures used by management as factors in determining the amount of cash that is available
for working capital needs or other uses of cash, however, they do not represent residual cash flows
available for discretionary expenditures. Free cash flow is defined as cash provided by (used in)
operating activities less capital expenditures. Adjusted free cash flow is defined as cash provided by
(used in) operating activities plus or minus events including, but not limited to, transaction and other
costs related to acquisitions, business transformation and other expenses for the integration of acquired
businesses, impacts of businesses classified as assets held-for-sale and businesses divested, and one-time
and other events such COVID-19 related payroll tax deferral and relief items. Adjusted free cash flow
conversion is defined as adjusted free cash flow as a percentage of adjusted EBITDA.

While we believe these non-U.S. GAAP measures are useful in evaluating our performance, this information

should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to the related financial
information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-U.S. GAAP financial measures may differ from
similar measures presented by other companies. In addition, these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures are subject to
inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management about which items are excluded or
included in determining these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures. Investors are encouraged not to rely on any single
financial measure to evaluate our business and to review the reconciliation of these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures
to their most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, which can be found in “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis and Results of Operations” and “Summary—Summary Financial Data.”

**_Company Overview_**

We are a market-leading business services provider of safety, specialty and industrial services in over 200

locations, primarily in North America and with an expanding platform in Europe. We provide statutorily mandated
and other contracted services to a strong base of long-standing customers across industries. We have a winning
leadership culture driven by entrepreneurial business leaders who deliver innovative solutions for our customers.

We achieved net revenues of $803 million and $3.6 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and

full year ended December 31, 2020, respectively. We operate our business under three primary operating segments,
which are also our reportable segments: Safety Services, Specialty Services and Industrial Services.

Our end markets include telecommunications, utilities, commercial, education, entertainment, industrial,

manufacturing, distribution and fulfillment centers, government, infrastructure, healthcare, high tech and others. Our
services include installation, inspection, maintenance, service and repair, retrofitting and upgrading, engineering and
design, and fabrication. The mission-critical nature of the services we offer and regulatory driven inspection and
maintenance requirements tend to provide us with reliable and recurring revenue streams.

We were established in 1926 as a small plumbing company in St. Paul, Minnesota and have since evolved to

a global industry leader by expanding into key markets and establishing both a national and international presence. In
2019, APi Group, Inc. was acquired by an acquisition vehicle founded by Sir Martin E. Franklin, James E. Lillie, and
Ian G.H. Ashken and effective April 29, 2020, our common stock began trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol
“APG”.

Our corporate headquarters are in New Brighton, Minnesota, and we conduct business throughout the United

States, Europe and Canada and other foreign locations. The map below highlights our broad geographic footprint:

**_Our Business Segments_**

We employ a regional operating model designed to improve speed and responsiveness to our customers

across our businesses, empower leadership of our businesses to drive business performance and execute key decisions,
and foster cross-functional sharing of best practices. This structure promotes a business-owner mindset among our
individual business leaders and combines the personal attention of a small-to-medium sized company with the strength
and support of an industry leader. It also allows each of our businesses to remain highly focused on best positioning
itself within the categories in which it competes and reinforces strong accountability for operational and financial s
performance.

**_Safety Services (approximately 45% of 2020 net revenues) – A leading provider of safety services in North_**

America and Europe, focusing on end-to-end integrated occupancy systems (fire protection services, Heating,
Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (“HVAC”) and entry systems), including design, installation, inspection and service
of these integrated systems. The work performed within this segment, includes customers in various industries and
facilities such as commercial, data center, distribution, education, healthcare, high tech, industrial and special-hazard
settings. According to the 2020 ENR report, we were the largest provider of fire protection and sprinkler services in
North America and management estimates we were a leading provider of critical safety services in markets in the
Benelux region. The average project size in the safety services segment was approximately $10,000 as of December
31, 2020.

**_Specialty Services (approximately 39% of 2020 net revenues) – A leading provider of a variety of_**

infrastructure services and specialized industrial plant services, which include maintenance and repair of critical
infrastructure such as electric, gas, water, sewer and telecommunications infrastructure. Our services include
engineering and design, fabrication, installation, maintenance service and repair, and retrofitting and upgrading.
Customers within this segment include private and public utilities, communications, healthcare, education,
manufacturing, industrial plants and governmental agencies throughout the United States. The average project size in
the specialty services segment was approximately $70,000 as of December 31, 2020.

**_Industrial Services (approximately 16% of 2020 net revenues) – A leading provider of a variety of services_**

to the energy industry focused on transmission and distribution. This segment’s services include oil and gas pipeline
infrastructure, access and road construction, supporting facilities, and performing ongoing integrity management and
maintenance. The average project size in the industrial services segment was approximately $700,000 as of December
31, 2020.

**_Our Industry_**

The industries in which we operate are highly fragmented and comprised of national, regional and local

companies that provide services to customers across various end markets and geographies. We believe the following
industry trends are affecting, and will continue to affect, demand for our services.

**_Increased Regulation. The life safety industry is highly regulated at the federal, state and local levels and_**

continuous regulatory changes, including mandated building codes and inspections and maintenance requirements,
continue to generate increasing demand for our services, often on a recurring basis. Specifically, the Uniform Building
Codes written by the National Fire Protection Association, and the International Code Council regulate fire
suppression and sprinkler systems. Among other things, these codes require testing, inspections, repair, maintenance
and specific retrofits of building fire suppression and sprinkler systems which generates recurring revenue related to
those services. As these associations and government agencies continue to adopt new, more stringent regulations, the
demand for our services increases.

2

businesses that install fire suppression and sprinkler systems in new buildings, upgrade existing systems or retrofit
existing structures with systems.

**_COVID-19 and Non-Residential Construction. The negative economic impacts of COVID-19 have had an_**

overall negative impact on non-residential construction. However, certain end markets we serve have been less
impacted, such as data centers and distribution. As a leading provider of specialty contracting services, we are
impacted by these macroeconomic events and are unable to know if the recovery from COVID-19 economic impacts
in all markets we serve will rebound timely and completely. We believe that certain services driven by regulatory
requirements assists our ability to have demand for our services even in tough markets; however, these markets may
experience additional congestion.

**_Differentiated Leadership Development_**

We provide leadership development opportunities that pave the way for retaining invested, loyal, and quality

employees. We have spent approximately $25 to $30 million on leadership development over the past five years and
plan to continue to invest in and support our leadership development culture. We believe our leadership development
culture empowers the leaders across our businesses, drive business performance and increase future cross-selling
opportunities. Another important initiative is our field-based leadership programs. We believe our approach to field
leadership is different from our peers’ field-based programs, which tend to focus on technical competence as opposed
to leadership. We have sent more than 650 field leaders to the FMI Field Leadership Institute since 2014 and have a
variety of learning opportunities specifically tailored to our field leaders. An example of this is our one-day Leading
Self program, which focuses on building foundational leadership skills and has had approximately 2,500 attendees
since inception.

**_Our Competitive Strengths_**

**_Aligned to Attractive Secular Industry Tailwinds. We believe that the industries in which we operate are_**

subject to increasingly complex and evolving regulatory environments and have experienced pent-up demand resulting
from years of deferred maintenance and retrofit investment. In addition, we believe that there is increasing demand
for specialty contracting services and for inspection and maintenance services relating to aging energy infrastructure
as customers try to prolong the useful lives of their pipelines and limit incidents. We believe this presents great
opportunities for us to drive growth in our businesses and enhance our market share positions. We also believe that
the diversity of the niche markets we serve and the regulatory-driven demand for certain of our services will enable
us to better withstand various economic cycles.

**_Stability Through Significant Recurring Service Revenue. We have a stable cash flow profile driven by_**

our recurring revenue services-focused business model. The mission-critical nature of services and regulatory-driven
inspection requirements provide predictable, recurring revenue stream opportunities. Maintenance and service
revenues are less cyclical, and are reasonably recurring due to consistent renewal rates and deep customer
relationships. On average, service and inspection revenue generates approximately 10% higher gross margin than
contract revenue. We have grown the mix of service revenue as a proportion of net revenues for our Life Safety
business from approximately 20% in 2008 to approximately 41% in 2020. We have a goal of increasing the service
revenue proportion of net revenue to 50% or greater.

3


-----

**_Diversified Across Clients, End Markets, Geographies and Projects. We have a diverse set of long-standing_**

blue chip customers who are spread across a variety of end markets, with low concentration. Many of our customers
have high creditworthiness in a direct service relationship or contracting role, providing stable cash flows and a
platform for organic growth. Our broad geographic footprint with over 200 locations in North America and Europe
allows us to maintain relationships with local decision makers while also having the ability to execute multi-site
services for national account customers. Our individual contracts carry little risk due to:

    - Small average project size of less than $100,000 in 2020 and relatively short average project duration
helping to mitigate inflationary exposure;

    - No single customer accounting for more than 5% of net revenues in 2020;

    - Contract loss rate of less than 1.5% of adjusted net revenues in 2020; and

    - Significant portion of business operates across acyclical end markets.

**_Differentiated Business Model Focused on Growing Service Revenue. Our go to market strategy is to sell_**

inspection work first, because we estimate that every dollar sold can lead to subsequent service work. In most cases,
our inspection work is covered by statutory requirements. Nearly all facilities that have existing life safety systems
are required by law to have that system inspected on an annual basis regardless of whether the facility is filled to
capacity or empty. This strategy differentiates us from our peers and ultimately creates a stickier client relationship,
that we believe leads to recurring revenue, higher margins and growth opportunities.

**_Resilient Business Model with Multiple Levers to Navigate Downturns._** Our proactive approach to

managing risk across its platform, recurring revenue services-focused business model and highly variable cost
structure provide significant flexibility for the Company to effectively navigate downturns. Union labor force allows
us to expand and contract our workforce as market conditions dictate without incurring significant trailing costs or
severance. Average project duration is relatively short, mitigating inflationary exposure to cost of goods sold or
changes in labor expense that some peers may experience in an inflationary environment. We also have an asset-light
model which requires minimal ongoing maintenance capital expenditures (typically less than 2% of total net revenues).
In a downturn we have multiple levers to pull to preserve cash due to a high proportion of variable costs.

**_Strong Margin and Cash Flow Profile with Clear Path to Continued Margin Expansion._** We believe that,

due to our differentiated operating model, diversified services offerings, historically strong organic growth and
disciplined acquisition strategy, we have an attractive financial performance profile. In addition, we support margin
growth by leveraging our scale to benefit from procurement savings resulting from enhanced purchasing power,
serving higher-margin, niche industries, and requiring minimal ongoing maintenance capital expenditures (typically
less than 2% of total net revenues). We also have significant recurring revenue, which supports our ability to generate
strong operating cash flows. The Company’s long-term objectives include delivering long-term organic revenue
growth above industry average, expanding adjusted EBITDA margin to 13% or greater by year-end 2025, and
maintaining average adjusted free cash flow conversion of 80% or greater.

**_Our Business Strategy_**

We intend to continue to grow our businesses, both organically and through acquisitions and advance our

position in each of the markets we serve by pursuing the following integrated business strategies:

**_Drive Organic Growth. We believe that we can continue to grow our businesses organically and capture_**

additional market share across each of our segments by focusing on growing maintenance, inspection, installation,
and service revenues and maximizing cross-selling opportunities.

    - Grow Maintenance, Inspection, and Service Revenue. We believe that we can drive substantial organic
growth by focusing on growing our maintenance, inspection, and service revenue, which is a component

4


-----

cross-selling opportunities, and customer relationships to continue to grow maintenance, inspection, and
service revenue.

    - Maximize Cross-Selling Opportunities. With diverse businesses, a broad reach across a variety of
different industries, geographies, and end markets and a culture of collaboration, we believe that we have
significant cross-selling opportunities to service more of the project life cycle and, once a project is
completed, to continue to grow attractive recurring revenue streams.

**_Accelerate Growth through Acquisitions._** We have a well-established acquisition platform with a track

record of executing accretive acquisitions through our selective approach to targeting and assessing potential
acquisitions that align with our values and strategic priorities. We have a disciplined acquisition platform through
which we systematically target, execute and integrate strategic acquisitions. Since 2005, we have completed over 70
acquisitions. Through our selective approach, we identify and assess companies that align with our strategic priorities
and demonstrate key value drivers such as culture, geography, end markets and client base, capabilities and leadership,
opportunity to expand our service offering or geographic footprint, or provide a competitive opportunity such as new
end markets or client base. Each of our businesses maintains its identity, reputation, customer relationships and culture
following acquisition while benefiting from the resources of the APG network, which we believe is an important
differentiator.

We believe that the markets in which we operate are fragmented and lend themselves to continued

opportunistic acquisitions. We have grown, and plan to continue to drive growth through, accretive acquisitions,
targeting businesses in our existing segments and those complementary to our service offerings. We believe that our
core strategies of driving organic growth and growth through accretive acquisitions, promoting sharing of best
practices across all of our businesses and leveraging our scale and services offerings, place us in the position to
capitalize on opportunities and trends in the industries we serve, grow our businesses and advance our position in each
of our markets. We believe that our diverse customer base, regional approach to operating our businesses, specialty
operations in niche markets, strong commitment to leadership development, long-standing customers with a robust
reputation in the industries we serve, and strong safety track record differentiates us from our competitors.

**_Continue to Foster Leadership Development throughout All Levels of the Organization._** We plan to

continue to invest in and support our leadership development culture through our Building Great Leaders[TM] platform,
which we believe will continue to empower the leaders across our businesses, drive business performance and create
future cross-selling opportunities. Our programmatic training and development curriculum focuses on a range of
topics from enhancing technical capabilities to developing soft skills, and decision-making training to enable
independent company leadership. We believe that this culture will continue to support our decentralized operating
model, which combines the personal attention of a small-to-medium sized company with the strength and support of
an industry leader.

**_Leverage Our Scale and Services Portfolio. We believe that we can grow our businesses and increase our_**

market position by leveraging our scale and broad portfolio of services offerings to capitalize on demand for singlesource national providers. For example, we plan to focus on expanding national accounts and further developing an
entity-wide purchasing program to realize the benefits from volume discounts and vendor pricing. In addition, we
plan to leverage our industry-leading positions and the leadership across our businesses to capture growth
opportunities across each of our segments.

**_COVID-19 Update_**

We continue to monitor the short- and long-term impacts of COVID-19, a global pandemic that has caused

a significant slowdown in the global economy beginning in March 2020. To date, the services we provide have been
deemed to be essential in most instances under various governmental orders. However, as the COVID-19 situation
has continued to evolve, we have seen impacts on our work due to the domino effects of various local, state and
national governmental orders, including but not limited to, reduced efficiency in performing our work while adhering
to physical distancing protocols demanded by COVID-19, customers deferring inspection and service projects, and
temporary shutdowns of active projects as customers work through COVID-19 related matters. As a result, we are
experiencing delays in certain projects and disruptions to the flow of our work to meet COVID-19 working protocols.
Although we are actively quoting new work for customers, should the macro economy continue to be negatively
impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic or worsen due to surges in cases, it is possible additional projects could be
delayed indefinitely or cancelled, or that we may not be allowed access to our customers’ facilities to perform

5


-----

to result in greater seasonal and cyclical volatility than would otherwise exist under normal conditions.

New or extended shelter-in-place orders or closures, or outbreaks in jurisdictions in which we operate or at

our project or work sites, could have a material negative impact on our net revenues and earnings. If a large number
of our employees who are located in a particular jurisdiction or are working on a project or work site are exposed to
or infected with COVID-19 and we are unable to hire qualified personnel due to labor shortages and other impacts of
the COVID-19 outbreak, we may be required to delay projects or the provision of our services for a period of time.
This could negatively impact our revenue, have a material adverse impact on our operating results and cause harm to
our reputation.

As we have continued to monitor our activity, revenue period over period has been negatively impacted by

the level of shelter-in-place orders and outbreaks of COVID-19, causing certain customers to temporarily halt work
to implement COVID-19 working protocols and other customers have delayed or cancelled projects. Generally, during
the latter half of 2020 and continuing into first quarter 2021, we saw indications of stabilizing and some volume
improvements as our teams and customers adapted to working in the COVID-19 environment and with the easing of
some shelter-in-place orders. There can be no assurance that this trend, which would allow us to recover prior year
volume levels, will continue in a positive manner.

As the economy is beginning to rebound from COVID-19, supply chains across multiple industries are

experiencing extended lead times and rising prices which are also impacting our business indirectly and directly. We
have been largely able to source the supplies and materials needed for our business but have seen some lengthening
in delivery schedules and pricing increases, which can impact our ability to start projects as planned and the timing of
our revenue and can create pressure on our margins. The continued impact of COVID-19, including its resurgence in
some geographies combined with the impact of reopening in others, is evolving and unpredictable and could make it
difficult to obtain needed supplies and materials at reasonable prices or as timely as needed. We also implemented a
preemptive cost reduction plan, which saved both expense and cash in 2020. As COVID-19 restrictions were easing
and volumes were increasing from earlier lows, these cost reductions have eased and costs were reinstated.

The United States Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has

warned that cybercriminals will take advantage of the uncertainty created by COVID-19 and federal and state
mandated quarantines to launch cybersecurity attacks. The risks could include more frequent malicious cybersecurity
and fraudulent activities, as well as schemes which attempt to take advantage of employees’ use of various
technologies to enable remote work activities. We believe the COVID-19 outbreak has incrementally increased our
cyber risk profile, but we are unable to predict the extent or impacts of those risks at this time. A significant disruption
in our information technology systems, unauthorized access to or loss of confidential information, or legal claims
resulting from violation of privacy laws could each have a material adverse effect on our business.

While we cannot estimate the duration or future negative financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on

our business, we are currently experiencing some negative impact, which we expect to continue in the future.

In prior economic downturns, the impact on our business has generally lagged against the impact of other

industries. We have no way of knowing if the economic crisis caused by COVID-19 will impact us similarly to past
economic downturns.

_An investment in the Notes involves risk.  In addition to the risks described below, you should also carefully_

_read all of the other information included in this offering circular, including those risk factors described in our Annual_
_Report and Quarterly Report incorporated by reference herein, in evaluating an investment in the Notes. The risks_
_and uncertainties described below and in the documents that we incorporated by reference herein are not the only_
_ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently deem immaterial, also_
_may become important factors that affect us. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, prospects, liquidity,_
_financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected, which, in turn, could adversely affect_
_our ability to pay interest or principal on the Notes or otherwise fulfill our obligations under the Indenture._

**Risk Factor Summary**

Below is a summary of the principal factors that may affect our business, financial condition, and results of

operations. This summary does not address all of the risks that we, or an investor in the Notes, may face. Additional
discussion of the risks summarized in this risk factor summary, and other risks that we and investors in the Notes may
face, can be found below under the heading “Risk Factors,” including the section entitled “Risks Relating to the
Notes,” and should be carefully considered, together with other information in this offering circular, the documents
incorporated herein by reference, and our other filings with the SEC.

    - As part of our business strategy, we rely on our ability to successfully acquire other businesses, integrate
acquired businesses into our operations, and manage the risks and potential liabilities associated with
those acquisitions, and our inability to do so could adversely affect our business and operating results.

    - Our regional, decentralized business model subjects us to various risks which may impact our ability to
execute on our business strategies and integrated policies and processes and to operate our business
successfully.

    - Our participation in joint ventures presents certain risks, including risks associated with the performance
and reputation of our joint venture partners.

    - The costs, expenses and time required to bring our business into compliance with the laws, regulations,
and requirements applicable to U.S. publicly traded companies have been and will continue to be
significant, and this work may not be completed timely.

    - We have expanded our international operations, which exposes us to additional legal, operational and
currency fluctuation risks.

    - Adverse developments in the credit markets could adversely affect funding of projects in our industries
and our ability to secure financing, make future investments, take advantage of acquisition opportunities,
or pursue other strategic initiatives.

    - A material portion of our revenue is recognized over time based on estimates of contract revenue, costs,
and profitability, and our reliance on such projections carries risk of revenue shortfalls.

    - The profitability of many of our customer projects, especially arrangements with fixed price terms,
depends on our ability to accurately estimate the costs of and manage those projects.

    - We experience variability in operating results between periods, which impacts our ability to forecast
future operating results and meet market expectations.

    - We have a significant amount of goodwill, identifiable intangible assets and fixed assets that are subject
to impairment in the future under certain circumstances, including additional goodwill impairment as a
result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

    - The COVID-19 pandemic presents risks to our business, markets, supply chain, customers and
workforce, to the credit and financial markets, and to the global economy generally.

or in our implementation and maintenance of effective controls, creates certain risks.

- Our substantial level of indebtedness and potential future indebtedness, and the associated compliance
obligations contained in the financial maintenance covenants in our Credit Facilities (as later defined)
and restrictions on our operations set forth in the Credit Agreement, increases the potential negative
impact of interest rate increases and creates risks to our cash flow, liquidity, and ability to operate our
business.

- We are effectively self-insured against many potential liabilities, which increases the financial risks
associated with the realization of such potential liabilities.

- We generally bear the risks of increases in the cost, or reductions in the supply, of the materials we use
in our business.

- Our contracts portfolio is primarily comprised of contracts with durations of less than six months, many
of which are subject to reduction or cancellation, which present risks that turn on our ability to maintain
a stable pipeline of projects.

- Our contracts portfolio also contains many highly-regulated government contracts and guaranties of
subsidiary contracts, which present elevated risks in the event of contract breach.

- A large portion of our workforce is covered by collective bargaining agreements, a fact which limits our
discretion in the management of covered employees and carries a risk of strikes or other concerted
activities that may impair our operations.

- We are vulnerable to the economic conditions affecting the industries we serve, including the
construction industry and the energy sector, as well as general economic conditions, which present risks
of a decline in demand for our services or in the financial condition of our customers and their ability
and willingness to invest in infrastructure projects.

- We often perform our services under dangerous and challenging conditions, which presents substantial
risks of injury and associated liability.

- Many of our services involve the installation of systems designed for the protection of lives and real and
personal property, and any failures in the operations of those systems present significant potential
liabilities.

- In our business we face regular litigation across a broad range of claims, including costs related to
damages we may be assessed as a result of product liability claims against our customers.

- Certain of the markets we serve are seasonal, and our projects can be negatively impacted by poor or
extreme weather.

- Our ability to collect on our contracts in the construction industry generally depends on the ability of our
customers to collect on upstream contracts, which subjects us to risk of nonpayment or late payment.

- We are governed by many health, safety and environmental laws and regulations, which presents
significant costs associated with compliance and significant risks associated with compliance
deficiencies.

- Customer consolidation in our industries, if realized, presents risks to our business model.

- We face the general risks of cybersecurity incidents, faulty forecasting of key metrics, deterioration in
our performance of services, increases in healthcare costs, significant employee misconduct, and adverse
regulatory changes, all of which may negatively impact our operations and financial results.

serve which may be jeopardized by the loss of key senior management personnel or a shortage of skilled
personnel.

    - The Notes will be subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future
operations.

    - The Notes will be structurally subordinated to existing and future liabilities and other indebtedness of
our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes.

    - We can enter into transactions like recapitalizations, reorganizations and other highly leveraged
transactions that do not constitute a change of control but that could adversely affect the holders of the
Notes.

    - We may redeem your Notes at our option, which may adversely affect your return.

    - If the Notes are rated investment grade at any time by both Moody’s and S&P, most of the restrictive
covenants and corresponding events of default contained in the Indenture will be suspended.

**Risks Related to Our Business**

**_Our business strategy includes acquiring companies and making investments that complement our existing_**
**_businesses. These acquisitions and investments could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources, which_**
**_could adversely affect our operating results._**

We expect to continue to evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses, service lines, and technologies with

the potential to strengthen our industry position or enhance our existing offerings. We cannot assure you that we will
identify or successfully complete suitable acquisitions in the future or that completed acquisitions will be successful.
Acquisitions that do not achieve the intended strategic or operational benefits could adversely affect our operating
results and may result in an impairment charge.

Under certain circumstances, it may be difficult for us to complete transactions quickly and to integrate

acquired operations efficiently into our current business operations. Acquisitions and investments may involve
significant cash expenditures, debt incurrence, operating losses and expenses that could have a material adverse effect
on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Acquisitions involve numerous
other risks, including: (i) diversion of management’s time and attention from daily operations; (ii) difficulties
integrating acquired businesses, technologies and personnel into our business; (iii) inability to obtain required
regulatory approvals and/or required financing on favorable terms; (iv) potential loss of key employees, key
contractual relationships, or key customers of acquired companies or from our existing businesses; and (v) assumption
of the liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies. Any acquisitions or investments may
ultimately harm our business or consolidated financial condition, as such acquisitions may not be successful and may
ultimately result in impairment charges.

**_We are a decentralized company and place significant decision-making authority with our subsidiaries’_**
**_management, supported by certain integrated policies and processes._**

We believe our practice of conferring significant authority upon the management of our subsidiaries has been

important to our successful growth and has allowed us to be responsive to opportunities and to our customers’ needs.
We seek to maintain business continuity within our subsidiaries while identifying and implementing operational
efficiencies, cost synergies, and integration of organizational processes across these companies. This balance presents
certain risks, including the risk we would be slower to identify a misalignment between a subsidiary’s and our overall
business strategy or shared processes. Our decentralized organization also creates the possibility that our operating
subsidiaries assume excessive risk without appropriate guidance from our centralized accounting, tax, treasury and
insurance functions, or external legal counsel, as to the potential overall impact. If an operating subsidiary fails to
follow our shared company policies and processes, including those relating to compliance with applicable laws, we
could be subjected to risks of noncompliance with applicable regulations, or made party to a contract, arrangement or
situation that requires the assumption of disproportionate liabilities or contain other less desirable terms.

21


-----

**_participation in joint ventures exposes us to liability and/or harm to our reputation for failures of our partners._**


The purpose of our joint ventures is typically to combine skills and resources to allow for the proposing on

and performance of particular projects. Success of these jointly performed projects can be adversely affected by the
performance of our joint venture partners, over whom we may have little or no control. Differences in opinions or
views between us and our joint venture partners could result in delayed decision-making or failure to agree on material
issues that could adversely affect the business and operations of our joint ventures. Additionally, the failure by a joint
venture partner to comply with applicable laws, regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our
business.

We and our joint venture partners are generally jointly and severally liable for all liabilities and obligations

of our joint ventures. If a joint venture partner fails to perform or is financially unable to bear its portion of required
capital contributions or other obligations, including liabilities stemming from claims or lawsuits, we could be required
to make additional investments, provide additional services or pay more than our proportionate share of a liability to
make up for our partner’s shortfall. Further, if our partners experience cost overruns or project performance issues
that we are unable to adequately address, the customer may terminate the project, which could result in legal liability
to us, harm our reputation and reduce our profit or increase our loss on a project.

**_As a newer U.S. public company, we face continued costs and administrative responsibilities associated with the_**
**_transition from private to public ownership._**

As a U.S. publicly traded company with listed equity securities, we need to comply with certain laws,

regulations and requirements, including certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, certain regulations of the SEC
and certain NYSE requirements applicable to public companies. Compliance with these various requirements
includes: continued preparation and distribution of periodic public reports under the federal securities laws; continued
development or refinement of our internal policies and establishment of frameworks and processes for compliance
with such policies; continued establishment and maintenance of internal controls over financial reporting; and
continued enhancement of our processes and systems for communicating with our investors. Complying with these
statutes, regulations and requirements has and will occupy a significant amount of the time of our Board and
management and may continue to increase our costs and expenses, or may not be completed timely.

In addition, as a public company the expense associated with director and officer liability insurance may be

higher and more variable than what we have historically experienced. Consequently, we may be required to accept
reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult
for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers and members of our Board, particularly to serve on our audit
committee.


**Risks Related to Our International Operations**


**_We have expanded our international operations, which subjects us to additional risks._**


With the acquisition of SK FireSafety (“SKG”) in October 2020 (the “SKG Acquisition”), our international

operations expanded from Canada and the United Kingdom (and to a much lesser extent, Mexico, Asia and the
Caribbean) to include the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, and Sweden. Approximately 10.8% and 6.7% of our
revenue was derived from areas outside the United States for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and year ended
December 31, 2020, respectively. Our overall business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and
cash flows could be negatively impacted by our international operations. We are paid for work outside the United
States in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Such payments may exceed our local currency needs, and, in certain
instances, those amounts may be subject to temporary blocking or taxes or tariffs, and we may experience difficulties
if we attempt to convert such amounts to U.S. dollars.

Applicable U.S. and non-U.S. anti-corruption laws, including but not limited to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt

Practices Act (“FCPA”), prohibit us from, among other things, corruptly making payments to non-U.S. officials for
the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We pursue opportunities in certain parts of the world and in certain
industries that may experience corruption, and in certain circumstances, compliance with these laws may conflict with
longstanding local customs and practices. Our policies mandate compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws.
We have policies and procedures designed to ensure that our employees and intermediaries who work for us outside
the United States comply with these laws, and we otherwise require such employees and intermediaries to comply
with these laws. However, there can be no assurance that such policies, procedures and other requirements will protect

22


-----

detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations of such laws is expensive and could consume
significant time and attention of our senior management, in-country management, and other personnel. Liability for
such actions could result in severe criminal or civil fines, penalties, forfeitures, disgorgements or other sanctions. This
in turn could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, consolidated financial condition, results of
operations, and cash flows.


**Financial Risks**


**_Adverse developments in the credit markets could adversely affect the funding of significant construction projects_**
**_and therefore reduce demand for our services._**

Adverse developments in the credit markets, including reduced liquidity or rising interest rates, could reduce

the availability of funding for large capital projects, including construction projects that require our services. Volatility
in the credit and equity markets could reduce the availability of debt or equity financing for significant construction
projects, causing a reduction in capital spending, which, in the past has resulted, and in the future could result, in
project pipeline constraints, project deferrals and project cancellations, any of which could materially and adversely
affect our results of operations and liquidity.

**_We may need additional capital in the future for working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions, and we may_**
**_not be able to access capital on favorable terms, or at all, which would impair our ability to operate our business_**
**_or achieve our growth objectives._**

Our ability to generate cash is essential for the funding of our operations and the servicing of our debt. If

existing cash balances together with the borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility and the term loans
available under our Credit Agreement (together with our Revolving Credit Facility, the “Credit Facilities”) were not
sufficient to make future investments, make acquisitions or provide needed working capital, we may require financing
from other sources. Our ability to obtain such additional financing in the future will depend on a number of factors
including prevailing capital market conditions, conditions in our industry, and our operating results. These factors
may affect our ability to arrange additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us. If additional funds were not
available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to make future investments, take advantage of acquisitions or pursue
other opportunities.

**_Our use of revenue recognition over time could result in a reduction or reversal of previously recorded revenue or_**
**_profits._**

A material portion of our revenue is recognized over time by measuring progress toward complete satisfaction

of performance obligations in the proportion that our actual costs bear to our estimated contract costs at completion.
The earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract revenue, costs and
profitability. We review our estimates of contract revenue, costs and profitability on an ongoing basis. Prior to
contract completion, we may adjust our estimates on one or more occasions as a result of change orders to the original
contract, collection disputes with the customer on amounts invoiced, claims against the customer for increased costs
incurred by us due to customer induced delays and other factors, or other changes in facts and circumstances that
require modifications to estimated costs. Contract losses are recognized in the fiscal period when the loss is
determined. Contract profit estimates are also adjusted in the fiscal period in which it is determined that an adjustment
is required. As a result of the requirements of over time revenue recognition, the possibility exists, for example, that
we could have estimated and reported a profit or loss on a contract over several periods and later determined that all
or a portion of such previously estimated and reported profits or losses were overstated. If this occurs, the full
aggregate amount of the overstatement or understatement will be reported for the period in which such determination
is made, thereby eliminating all or a portion of any profits or losses from other contracts that would have otherwise
been reported in such period or even resulting in a loss or gain being reported for such period. On a historical basis,
we believe that we have made reasonably reliable estimates of the progress towards completion on our long-term
contracts. However, given the uncertainties associated with these types of contracts, it is possible for actual costs to
vary from estimates previously made, which may result in reductions or reversals of previously recorded revenue and
profits.

23


-----

**_potential for any of the foregoing, may adversely affect our business._**


Interest payments for borrowings under the Credit Facilities are based on floating rates which at times

references a LIBOR rate. It is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to alternative rates
will occur over the course of the next few years. The United Kingdom (“U.K.”) Financial Conduct Authority
announced in 2017 that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. In addition, other regulators have suggested
reforming or replacing other benchmark rates. The discontinuation, reform or replacement of LIBOR or any other
benchmark rates may have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics in the credit markets or cause disruption
to the broader financial markets. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential discontinuation, reform or replacement
may negatively impact interest expense related to borrowings under our Credit Facilities, including the Term Loan
and the interest rate swap we entered into with respect thereto. We may in the future pursue amendments to our Credit
Facilities to provide for a transition mechanism or other reference rate in anticipation of LIBOR’s discontinuation, but
we may not be able to reach agreement with its lenders on any such amendments. Further, certain of our current debt
instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur. As a result, additional financing to
replace our LIBOR-based indebtedness may be unavailable, available on less favorable terms or restricted by the terms
of our outstanding indebtedness.

**_We carry a significant amount of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheets._**
**_Earnings for future periods may be impacted by impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets._**

Goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses. We

assess goodwill and identifiable intangible assets for impairment each year, or more frequently if circumstances
suggest an impairment may have occurred. As a result of the impact of COVID-19, in the year ended December 31,
2020 we determined that certain of our goodwill and intangible assets were impaired as the carrying values exceeded
fair value and we recorded a non-cash charge of $197 million. Given the uncertainty of these factors, as well as the
inherent difficulty in predicting the severity and duration of the COVID-19 global pandemic and associated recovery
and the uncertainties regarding the potential financial impact on our business and the overall economy, there can be
no assurance that our estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the goodwill testing performed during the year
ended December 31, 2020 will prove to be accurate predictions of the impact in future periods.

While we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair values of our

reporting units which were based on facts and circumstances known at such time, it is possible that existing or new
events may result in forecasted cash flows, revenue and earnings that differ from those that formed the basis of our
estimates and assumptions, which could be materially different from our estimates and assumptions. If so, we may
be required to record additional impairment charges in the future, which could be material.

Additionally, we have a significant amount of identifiable intangible assets and fixed assets that could also

be subject to impairment. If we determine that a significant impairment has occurred in the value of our unamortized
intangible assets or fixed assets, we could be required to write off a portion of our assets, which could adversely affect
our consolidated financial condition or our reported results of operations.

**_The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or similar global health concerns, could lead to project delays or_**
**_cancellations, could adversely affect our ability to timely complete projects and source the supplies we need, and_**
**_may impact labor availability and productivity, and could result in impairment risks, each of which could adversely_**
**_impact our business, financial condition and results of operations._**

The coronavirus outbreak in China in December 2019 and the subsequent spread of the virus throughout the

world has resulted in widespread infections and fatalities. Governments in affected countries, including the United
States, have launched measures to combat the spread of COVID-19, including travel bans, quarantines and lock-downs
of affected areas that include closures of non-essential businesses. In addition, the initial outbreak has been followed
by a resurgence of illness caused by the virus and/or variants of the virus in many areas. The future incidence of
illness from the virus and its variants is highly unpredictable. We rely on the availability of our skilled workforce and
third-party contractors to meet contractual milestones and timely complete projects. If the incidence of COVID-19
outbreaks were to require us to discontinue operations, or to cause shortages of our workforce or third-party
contractors, it could result in cancellations or deferrals of project work, which could lead to a decline in revenue and
an increase in costs. In addition, such outbreaks have and may continue to impact the availability and prices of the
commodities, supplies and materials needed for projects, and we may experience difficulties obtaining such
commodities, supplies and materials from suppliers or vendors whose supply chains are impacted by any outbreaks.
Additionally, as certain areas are able to resume economic activity either due to a low or diminished incidence of

24


-----

If we are unable to source the essential commodities, supplies and materials in adequate quantities, at acceptable prices
and in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
Similarly, our customers may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which could cause them to cancel or defer
project work, or have difficulty settling our accounts receivable timely, if at all, which could have a negative impact
on our business.

In addition, our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the credit and financial markets

and the economy generally. Global credit and financial markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruptions
as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic including diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer
confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability.
There can be no assurance that deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions
will not occur or be sustained as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Any protracted economic disruption or recession
could lead customers to delay or cancel projects, which would negatively impact our revenues, earnings and financial
condition. As noted, as a result of the pandemic, certain of our goodwill and intangible assets were impaired. The
impacts of COVID-19 may also lead to increases in our future contribution obligations and potential withdrawal
liability exposure in connection with the multiemployer pension plans in which we participate. In addition, our general
business strategy may be adversely affected by any such economic downturn, volatile business environment or
continued unpredictable and unstable market conditions. If the current equity and credit markets deteriorate, or do
not improve, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult, more costly, and more dilutive.
Failure by us or our customers to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could
have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, financial performance and stock price and could require us to
delay or abandon current or expected projects.

The circumstances and global disruption caused by COVID-19 has affected, and we believe will continue to

affect, our businesses, operating results, cash flows and financial condition; however, the scope and duration of the
impact is highly uncertain. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, markets, supply
chain, customers and workforce will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be
predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the
actions to treat or contain it or to otherwise limit its impact, among others.

**_In connection with our preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31,_**
**_2020, 2019 and 2018, we and our independent registered public accounting firm identified material weaknesses in_**
**_our internal control over financial reporting._**

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial

reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP (as
later defined). Prior to the APi Acquisition, the acquired business was not subject to public company internal control
framework requirements and therefore did not design and document its control environment to be in compliance with
required public company standards. Additionally, we and our independent registered public accounting firm were not
required to and did not perform an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020,
2019 and 2018 in accordance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In connection with our preparation of
our consolidated financial statements in this registration statement for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and
2018, we and our independent registered public accounting firm identified material weaknesses in our internal control
over financial reporting. Under standards established by the United States Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board, a material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting
such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will
not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis.

As indicated above, control deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting have been identified

which constitute material weaknesses relating to inadequate design and implementation of:

    - information technology general controls that prevent the information systems from providing complete
and accurate information consistent with financial reporting objectives and current needs;

    - internal controls over the preparation of the financial statements, including the insufficient review and
oversight over financial reporting, journal entries along with related file documentation;

    - internal controls to identify and manage segregation of certain accounting duties;

25


-----

and

    - management review controls over projected financial information used in fair value financial models
used for purchase accounting and intangible asset valuations.

We cannot assure you that we have identified all, or that we will not in the future have additional, material

weaknesses. If we fail to remediate any material weaknesses or if we otherwise fail to establish and maintain effective
control over financial reporting, our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results could be adversely
affected. Management is in the process of executing its remediation plan. The material weaknesses will not be
considered remediated until management designs and implements effective controls that operate for a sufficient period
of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are effective. We will monitor the
effectiveness of our remediation plans and will make changes management determines to be appropriate.

If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent

registered public accounting firm is unable when required in the future to express an unqualified opinion as to the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and
completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our Common Stock could be adversely affected, and we
could become subject to litigation or investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC
or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.

**_Our substantial indebtedness may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business and fulfill_**
**_our obligations under our indebtedness._**

As of March 31, 2021, on a consolidated basis, we had approximately $1.4 billion of indebtedness, consisting

primarily of indebtedness outstanding under our Credit Facilities.


Our substantial indebtedness could have significant effects on our operations. For example, it may:



    - require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our
indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital
expenditures, dividends, research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes;

    - increase the amount of our interest expense, because our borrowings are at variable rates of interest,
which, if interest rates increase, would result in higher interest expense;

    - cause credit rating agencies to view our debt level negatively;

    - increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

    - limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which
we operate;

    - limit our ability to make strategic acquisitions, introduce new technologies or exploit business
opportunities; and

    - place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness.

In addition, the Credit Agreement governing the Credit Facilities contains covenants that restrict our

operations. These covenants restrict, among other things, our ability to incur additional debt, grant liens, pay cash
dividends, enter new lines of business, redeem our Common Stock, make certain investments and engage in certain
merger, consolidation or asset sale transactions. These restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market
conditions, meet extraordinary capital needs or otherwise take actions that we believe are in the best interest of the
Company. Further, a failure by us to comply with any of these covenants and restrictions could result in an event of
default that, if not waived or cured, could result in the acceleration of all or a substantial portion of the outstanding
indebtedness thereunder.

26


-----

**_opportunities, and our future debt level may limit our future financial and operating flexibility._**


The Credit Agreement governing the Credit Facilities prohibits distributions on, or purchases or redemptions

of, securities if any default or event of default is continuing. In addition, it contains various covenants limiting our
ability to, among other things, incur indebtedness if certain financial ratios are not maintained, grant liens, engage in
transactions with affiliates, enter into sale-leaseback transactions, and sell substantially all of our assets or enter into
a merger or consolidation. The Credit Agreement governing the Credit Facilities also treats a change of control as an
event of default and also requires us to maintain certain leverage ratios.

Our ability to access capital markets to raise capital on favorable terms will be affected by our debt level, our

operating and financial performance, the amount of our current maturities and debt maturing in the next several years,
and by prevailing credit market conditions. Moreover, if lenders or any future credit rating agency downgrade our
credit rating, then we could experience increases in our borrowing costs, face difficulty accessing capital markets or
incurring additional indebtedness, be unable to receive open credit from our suppliers and trade counterparties, be
unable to benefit from swings in market prices and shifts in market structure during periods of volatility in the crude
oil and natural gas markets or suffer a reduction in the market price of our Common Stock. If we are unable to access
the capital markets on favorable terms at the time a debt obligation becomes due in the future. The price and terms
upon which we might receive such extensions or additional bank credit, if at all, could be more onerous than those
contained in existing debt agreements. Any such arrangements could, in turn, increase the risk that our leverage may
adversely affect our future financial and operating flexibility and thereby impact our ability to pay cash distributions
at expected rates.


**_We may incur substantial additional indebtedness, which could further exacerbate the risks that we may face._**


Subject to the restrictions in the agreements that govern the Credit Agreement, we may incur substantial

additional indebtedness (including secured indebtedness) in the future. These restrictions are subject to waiver and a
number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions
could be substantial.

Any material increase in our level of indebtedness will have several important effects on our future

operations, including, without limitation:

    - we would have additional cash requirements in order to support the payment of interest on our
outstanding indebtedness;

    - increases in our outstanding indebtedness and leverage would increase its vulnerability to adverse
changes in general economic and industry conditions, as well as to competitive pressure; and

    - depending on the levels of our outstanding indebtedness, our ability to obtain additional financing for
working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes could be limited.

**_An increase in interest rates would increase the interest costs on our Credit Facilities and on our floating rate_**
**_indebtedness and could impact adversely our ability to refinance existing indebtedness or to sell assets._**

Interest payments for borrowings under the Credit Facilities are based on floating rates. As a result, an

increase in interest rates will reduce our cash flow available for other corporate purposes.


Rising interest rates also could limit our ability to refinance existing indebtedness when it matures and

increase interest costs on any indebtedness that is refinanced. We have and may continue to enter into agreements
such as floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps, caps, floors and other hedging contracts in order to fully or partially hedge
against the cash flow effects of changes in interest rates for floating rate debt. For example, effective October 1, 2019,
we entered into an interest rate swap on a portion of our Term Loan, which swapped a portion of the principal amount
which was accruing interest at a rate based on LIBOR for a fixed rate. However, we may not maintain interest rate
swaps with respect to all of our floating rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our
interest rate risk. In addition, these agreements expose us to the risk that other parties to the agreements will not
perform or that the agreements will be unenforceable.

27


-----

We maintain insurance policies covering a broad range of risks, including automobile liability, general

liability, workers’ compensation and employee group health. However, these policies do not cover all possible claims
and certain of the policies are subject to large deductibles. Accordingly, we are effectively self-insured for a
substantial number of actual and potential claims. In addition, if any of our insurance carriers defaulted on their
obligations to provide insurance coverage by reason of its insolvency or for other reasons, our exposure to claims
would increase and our profits would be adversely affected.

Our estimates for unpaid claims and expenses are based on known facts, historical trends and industry

averages, utilizing the assistance of an actuary. The determination of such estimated liabilities and their
appropriateness are reviewed and updated at least quarterly. However, these liabilities are difficult to assess and
estimate due to many relevant factors, the effects of which are often unknown, including the severity of an injury or
damage, the determination of liability in proportion to other parties, the timeliness of reported claims, the effectiveness
of our risk management and safety programs and the terms and conditions of our insurance policies. Our accruals are
based upon known facts, historical trends and our reasonable estimate of future expenses, and we believe such accruals
are adequate. However, unknown or changing trends, risks or circumstances, such as increases in claims, a weakening
economy, increases in medical costs, changes in case law or legislation, or changes in the nature of the work we
perform, could render our current estimates and accruals inadequate. In such case, adjustments to our balance sheet
may be required and these increased liabilities would be recorded in the period that the experience becomes known.
Our costs of insurance coverage have steadily risen and the market, particularly for excess coverage, has hardened.
Insurance carriers may be unwilling, in the future, to provide our current levels of coverage without a significant
increase in insurance premiums and/or collateral requirements to cover our obligations to them. Increased collateral
requirements may be in the form of additional letters of credit and/or cash, and an increase in collateral requirements
could significantly reduce our liquidity. If insurance premiums continued to increase, and/or if insurance claims are
higher than our estimates, our profitability could be adversely affected.

**_Improperly managed projects or project delays may result in additional costs or claims against us, which could_**
**_have a material adverse effect on our operating results, cash flows and liquidity._**

The quality of our performance on any given project depends in large part upon the ability of the project

manager(s) to manage relationships and the project itself and to timely deploy appropriate resources, including both
third-party contractors and our own personnel. Our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be adversely
affected if a project manager or our personnel miscalculate the resources or time needed to complete a project with
capped or fixed fees, or the resources or time needed to meet contractual milestones. Additionally, delays on a
particular project, including delays in designs, engineering information or materials provided to us by the customer or
a third party, delays or difficulties in equipment and material delivery, schedule changes, delays from failure to timely
obtain permits or rights-of-way or to meet other regulatory requirements, weather-related delays, governmental,
industry, political and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, could result in cancellations or deferrals
of project work, which could lead to a decline in revenue, or, for project deferrals, could cause us to incur costs for
standby pay, and could lead to personnel shortages on other projects scheduled to commence at a later date.

We could also encounter project delays due to local opposition, including political and social activism, which

could include injunctive actions or public protests related to the siting of oil, natural gas, or electric power transmission
lines or for power generation or other facilities, and such delays could adversely affect our project margins. In
addition, some of our agreements require that we share in cost overages or pay liquidated damages if we do not meet
project deadlines; therefore, any failure to properly estimate or manage cost, or delays in the completion of projects,
could subject us to penalties, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Further,
any defects or errors, or failures to meet our customers’ expectations, could result in reputational harm and large
damage claims against us. Due to the substantial cost of, and potentially long lead-times necessary to acquire certain
of the materials and equipment used in our complex projects, damage claims could substantially exceed the amount
we can charge for our associated services.


**Risks Related to Our Contracts**


**_We may not accurately estimate the costs associated with services provided under fixed price contracts, which could_**
**_impair our financial performance._**

A portion of our agreements with customers contain fixed price terms. Under these contracts, we typically

set the price of our services on a per unit or aggregate basis and assume the risk that costs associated with our

28


-----

require the installation or construction of an entire infrastructure system or specified units within an infrastructure
system, many of which are priced on a fixed price or per unit basis. Profitability for these contracts will be reduced if
actual costs to complete a project exceed our original estimates. If estimated costs to complete the remaining work
for a project exceed the expected revenue to be earned, the full amount of any expected loss is recognized in the period
the loss is determined. Our profitability on these contracts is therefore dependent upon our ability to accurately
estimate the costs associated with our services and our ability to execute in accordance with our plans. A variety of
factors could negatively affect these estimates, including changes in expected productivity levels, conditions at work
sites differing materially from those anticipated at the time we propose on the contract, and higher than expected costs
of labor and/or materials. These variations, along with other risks inherent in performing fixed price contracts, could
cause actual project results to differ materially from our original estimates, which could result in lower margins than
anticipated, or losses, which could reduce our profitability, cash flows and liquidity.


**_A portion of our contracts allocate the risk of price increases in supplies to us._**


For certain contracts, including where we have assumed responsibility for procuring materials for a project,

we are exposed to market risk of increases in certain commodity prices of materials, such as copper and steel, which
are used as components of supplies or materials utilized in all of our operations. In addition, our customers’ capital
budgets may be impacted by the prices of certain materials. These prices could be materially impacted by general
market conditions and other factors, including U.S. trade relationships with other countries or the imposition of tariffs.
We are also exposed to increases in energy prices, including as they relate to gasoline prices for our rolling-stock fleet
of approximately 8,000 units. Additionally, the price of fuel required to run our vehicles and equipment is
unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control. Any increase in fuel costs could materially reduce
our profitability and liquidity to the extent we are not able to adjust our pricing for such expenses. While we believe
we can increase our prices to adjust for some price increases in commodities, there can be no assurance that price
increases of commodities, if they were to occur, would be recoverable. Additionally, some of our fixed price contracts
do not allow us to adjust our prices and, as a result, increases in material or fuel costs could reduce our profitability
with respect to such projects.

**_Some of our subsidiaries are government contractors, and they are subject to complex rules and regulations_**
**_governing government contractors, and their contracts with government entities are subject to audit. Violations of_**
**_the applicable rules and regulations could result in a subsidiary being barred from future government contracts._**

Government contractors must comply with many regulations and other requirements that relate to the award,

administration and performance of these contracts, and government contracts are subject to audit. A violation of these
laws and regulations could result in imposition of fines and penalties, the termination of a government contract or
debarment from proposing on government contracts in the future. Further, despite our decentralized nature, a violation
at one of our locations could impact other locations’ ability to propose on and perform government contracts.
Additionally, because of our decentralized nature, we face risks in maintaining compliance with all local, state and
federal government contracting requirements. Prohibition against proposing on future government contracts could
have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our backlog is subject to reduction or cancellation, and revenues may be realized in different periods than initially_**
**_reflected in our backlog._**

Our backlog includes the estimated unsatisfied performance obligations associated with the services to be

performed under customer contracts. These estimates are based on contract terms and evaluations regarding the timing
of the services to be provided. In many instances, our customers are not contractually committed to procure specific
volumes of services under a contract. Revenue estimates reflected in our backlog can be subject to change due to a
number of factors, including contract cancellations and contract changes made by our customers to the amount or
nature of the work actually performed under a contract. In addition, revenue reflected in our backlog may be realized
in periods different from those previously reported due to the factors above as well as project accelerations, or delays
due to various reasons, including, but not limited to, customer scheduling changes, commercial issues such as
permitting, engineering revisions, difficult job site conditions, and adverse weather. The amount or timing of our
backlog can also be impacted by the merger or acquisition activity of our customers. As a result, our backlog as of
any particular date is an uncertain indicator of the amount of or timing of future revenues and earnings.

**_Some of our customers require surety bonds as a contract term and, accordingly, a portion of our business depends_**
**_on our ability to provide surety bonds. Any difficulties in the financial and surety markets or in our ability to obtain_**

29


-----

**_for or work on projects._**


As of March 31, 2021, we had approximately $217 million in outstanding construction surety bonds (bid,

payment, and performance bonds) related to our projects that required an underlying surety bond. Historically, surety
market conditions have experienced times of difficulty as a result of significant losses incurred by surety companies
and the results of macroeconomic trends outside of our control. Consequently, during times when less overall bonding
capacity is available in the market, surety terms have become more expensive and more restrictive. We cannot
guarantee our ability to maintain a sufficient level of bonding capacity in the future, which could preclude our ability
to propose for certain contracts or successfully contract with some customers.

Our surety providers are under no commitment to guarantee us access to new bonds in the future; thus, our

ability to access or increase bonding capacity is at the sole discretion of the providers. If our surety companies were
to limit or eliminate our access to bonds, the alternatives would include seeking bonding capacity from other surety
companies, increasing business with clients that do not require bonds, and posting other forms of collateral for project
performance, such as letters of credit or cash. We may be unable to secure these alternatives in a timely manner, on
acceptable terms, or at all. If we were to experience an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity
as a result of these or any other reasons, we may be unable to compete for or work on the portion of projects available
to us that require bonding. Additionally, even if we continue to access bonding capacity to sufficiently bond future
projects, we may be required to post collateral to secure bonds, which would decrease the liquidity we would have
available for other purposes.

**_In some instances, we guarantee performance and completion of contracts entered into by our subsidiaries, which_**
**_could subject us to additional costs._**

In some instances, we guarantee completion of a subsidiary’s contract or project by a specific date or price,

cost savings, or achievement of certain performance standards. If a third party holding the guaranty seeks relief
thereunder, we may be held responsible for performance under the subsidiary’s contract and costs resulting from the
subsidiary’s failures. If we subsequently fail to meet such guarantees, such failure could result in our payment of
liquidated or other damages. To the extent that any of these events occur, the total costs of a project could exceed the
original estimated costs, and we would experience reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss.


**Risks Related to Our Workforce**


**_Our unionized workforce and related obligations could adversely affect our operations. These obligations may_**
**_include cash contributions to meet our underfunded obligations in certain multiemployer pension plans._**

As of March 31, 2021, approximately 47.2% of our employees were covered by collective bargaining

agreements. The terms of these agreements limit our discretion in the management of covered employees and our
ability to nimbly implement changes in the terms and conditions of employment to meet business needs. Certain of
our unionized employees have participated in strikes and work stoppages in the past, and we cannot be certain that
strikes or work stoppages will not occur in the future. Strikes or work stoppages could adversely impact relationships
with our customers and could cause us to lose business and experience a decline in revenues. Our ability to complete
future acquisitions also could be adversely affected because of our union status for a variety of reasons. For instance,
our union agreements may be incompatible with the union agreements of a business we want to acquire, and some
businesses may not want to become affiliated with a union-based company. Moreover, certain of our customers
require or prefer a non-union workforce, and they may reduce the amount of work assigned to us if our nonunion labor crews become unionized, which could negatively affect our business, consolidated financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows.

Additionally, our collective bargaining agreements generally require us to participate with other companies

in multiemployer pension plans. To the extent those plans are underfunded, the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, as amended by the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, may subject us to substantial
liabilities under those plans if we withdraw from them or they are terminated or experience a mass withdrawal. In
connection with our acquisitions, we may be required to increase our exposure to withdrawal liabilities for
underfunded multiemployer pension plans to which an acquired company historically contributed or presently
contributes. Our future contribution obligations and potential withdrawal liability exposure with respect to these plans
could increase significantly based on the investment and actuarial performance of those plans, the insolvency of other
companies that contribute to those plans and other factors, which could be negatively impacted as a result of the

30


-----

and related issues.


In addition, certain plans to which we contribute or may contribute in the future are in “endangered,”

“seriously endangered” or “critical” status. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 added special funding and operational
rules generally applicable to plan years beginning after 2007 for multiemployer plans that are classified as
“endangered,” “seriously endangered” or “critical” status based on multiple factors (including, for example, the plan’s
funded percentage, cash flow position and whether it is projected to experience a minimum funding deficiency). Plans
in these classifications must adopt measures to improve their funded status through a funding improvement or
rehabilitation plan, as applicable, which may require additional contributions from employers (which may take the
form of a surcharge on benefit contributions) and/or modifications to retiree benefits. The amount of additional funds,
if any, that we may be obligated to contribute to these plans in the future cannot be estimated due to uncertainty of the
future levels of work that require the specific use of union employees covered by these plans, as well as the future
contribution levels and possible surcharges on contributions applicable to these plans.

**_We maintain a workforce based upon current and anticipated workloads. We could incur significant costs and_**
**_reduced profitability from underutilization of our workforce if we do not receive future contract awards, if contract_**
**_awards are delayed, or if there is a significant reduction in the level of services we provide. Shortages of skilled_**
**_labor could impede our ability to provide timely, cost-effective services to our customers_**

Our estimates of future performance and results of operations depend, among other factors, on whether and

when we receive new contract awards, which affect the extent to which we are able to utilize our workforce. The rate
at which we utilize our workforce is affected by a variety of factors, including our ability to forecast the need for our
services, which allows us to maintain an appropriately sized workforce, our ability to transition employees from
completed projects to new projects or between internal business groups, our ability to manage attrition, and our need
to devote resources to non-chargeable activities such as training or business development. While our estimates are
based upon our good faith judgment, professional knowledge and experience, these estimates may not be accurate and
may frequently change based on newly available information. In the case of large-scale projects where timing is often
uncertain, it is particularly difficult to predict whether and when we will receive a contract award. The uncertainty of
contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size to our project needs. If an expected
contract award is delayed or not received, we could incur significant costs and reduced profitability resulting from
underutilization of our workforce, redundancy of facilities, or from efforts to right-size our workforce and/or
operations, which could reduce our profitability and cash flows. Conversely, general trends in our industry suggest
that we may face a shortage of skilled workers in the mid- to long-term. Competition in the market for labor could
drive up our costs, reduce our profitability, or impact our ability to deliver timely service to our customers.


**Risks Related to Our Customer Base**


**_We serve customers who are involved in energy exploration, production and transportation, and adverse_**
**_developments affecting activities in these industries, including sustained low or further reduced oil or natural gas_**
**_prices, reduced demand for oil and natural gas products, or increased regulation of exploration and production,_**
**_could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations._**

Our energy and infrastructure businesses depend on energy industry participants’ willingness to make

operating and capital expenditures to build pipelines to transport oil and natural gas and the development and
production of oil and natural gas in the United States. The level of activity in the new construction of oil and natural
gas pipelines, oil and natural gas exploration and production in the U.S. has been volatile. A reduction in these
activities generally results in decreased demand for our support services in that industry. Therefore, if these
expenditures decline, our business is likely to be adversely affected.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the prices of crude oil and related products dropped substantially in 2020.

This price and demand volatility impacted the level of work customers were undertaking. However, the price of crude
oil and related products have largely recovered in 2021, and remain uncertain. This uncertainty is heightened by the
potential for significant change in energy policy under the Biden administration. If crude oil prices fall or experience
further volatility, energy and production companies, pipeline owners and operators and public utility or local
distribution companies in the regions we conduct our business may reduce or delay capital spending to expand or
maintain their pipelines or oil and natural gas production. Decreases in production related field activities could have
an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, demand for services, and cash flows.

31


-----

**_infrastructure._**


A portion of our current business and a portion of our future growth is expected to result from public and

private investments in infrastructure. As a result, reduced or delayed spending, including the impact of government
sequestration programs or other changes in budget priorities could result in the deferral, delay or disruption of our
projects. These potential events could also impact our ability to be timely paid for our current services, which could
adversely affect our cash flows and margins.


**Risks Related to Our Occupational Hazards**


**_Our businesses at times perform services under challenging conditions involving factors outside of our control._**


The challenging conditions we encounter may include, without limitation, (i) hard to reach terrain and

difficult site conditions; (ii) challenging engineering, procurement and construction phases, which may occur over
extended time periods; (iii) difficulties or delays in designs or materials provided by the customer or a third party; (iv)
equipment and material delivery delays; (v) schedule changes; (vi) delays from customer failure to timely
obtain rights-of-way; (vii) weather-related delays, (viii) COVID-19-related changes to working conditions or
disruptions; and (ix) delays by subcontractors in completing their portion of the project. Performing services under
such conditions can result in project delays or cancellations, potentially causing us to incur unanticipated costs,
reductions in revenue or the payment of liquidated damages. In addition, some of our contracts require that we assume
the risk should actual site conditions vary from those expected.

In some cases, delays and additional costs may be substantial, and we may be required to cancel a project

and/or compensate the customer for the delay. We may not be able to recover any of such costs. Any such delays,
cancellations, errors or other failures to meet customer expectations could result in damage claims substantially in
excess of the revenue associated with a project. Delays or cancellations could also negatively affect our reputation or
relationships with our customers, which could adversely affect our ability to secure new contracts.

**_Our business is subject to operational hazards due to the nature of services we provide and the conditions in which_**
**_we operate, including electricity, fires, explosions, mechanical failures and weather-related incidents._**

The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended (the “OSH Act”), establishes certain employer

responsibilities, including maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious
injury, compliance with standards promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and various
recordkeeping, disclosure and procedural requirements. Various standards, including standards for notices of hazards
and safety, may apply to our operations. We incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in the ordinary
course of business in complying with the OSH Act and other state and local laws and regulations, and could incur
penalties and fines in the future, including, in extreme cases, criminal sanctions.

While we invest substantial resources in occupational health and safety programs, the construction industry

involves a high degree of operational risk, and there can be no assurance that we will avoid significant liability.
Although we have taken what we believe to be appropriate precautions, we have had employee injuries and fatalities
in the past and may suffer additional injuries or fatalities in the future. Serious accidents of this nature may subject
us to substantial penalties, civil litigation or criminal prosecution. Personal injury claims for damages, including for
bodily injury or loss of life, could result in substantial costs and liabilities, which could materially and adversely affect
our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, if our safety record were to
deteriorate, or if we suffered substantial penalties or criminal prosecution for violation of health and safety regulations,
customers could cancel existing contracts and not award future business to us, which could materially adversely affect
our liquidity, cash flows and results of operations. If we were not able to successfully resolve such issues, our ability
to service our customers could be damaged, which could lead to a material adverse effect on our consolidated results
of operations, cash flows and liquidity.

Construction projects undertaken by us expose our employees to electrical lines, pipelines carrying

potentially explosive or toxic materials, heavy equipment, transportation accidents, adverse weather conditions and
the risk of damage to equipment and property. These hazards, among others, can cause personal injuries and loss of
life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and other consequential damages and could lead to
suspension of operations and large damage claims which could, in some cases, substantially exceed the amount we
charge for the associated services. In addition, if serious accidents or fatalities occur, or if our safety records were to
deteriorate, we may be restricted from proposing on certain work or obtaining new contracts, and certain existing

32


-----

bureaus. The occurrence of accidents in the course of our business could result in significant liabilities, employee
turnover, increase the costs of our projects or harm our ability to perform under our contracts or enter into new
customer contracts, all of which may subject us to liabilities, affect customer relationships, result in higher operating
costs, negatively impact employee morale and result in higher employee turnover and could materially adversely affect
our profitability and our consolidated financial condition.


**Claims and Litigation Risks**


**_We are and may become subject to periodic litigation which may adversely affect our business and financial_**
**_performance._**

We are subject to various lawsuits, administrative proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of

business. We could be party to class and collective actions, along with other complex legal disputes, that could
materially impact our business by requiring, among other things, unanticipated management attention, significant
attorney fees and settlement spend, or operational adjustments implemented in response to a settlement, court order
or to mitigate future exposure.

We may have litigation in a variety of matters, some matters may be unpredictable or unanticipated, and the

frequency and severity of litigation could increase. Because lawsuits are inherently unpredictable, assessing
contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgements about future events. A judgement that is not covered by
insurance or that is significantly in excess of our insurance coverage could materially adversely affect our consolidated
financial condition or results of operations.

**_We are exposed to product liability, workmanship warranty, casualty, negligence, construction defect, breach of_**
**_contract and other claims and legal proceedings._**

From time to time, we are subject to product liability, workmanship warranty, casualty, negligence,

construction defect, breach of contract and other claims and legal proceedings relating to the products we install that,
if adversely determined, could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows. We rely on manufacturers and other suppliers to provide us with most of the products we install. Because we
do not have direct control over the quality of such products manufactured or supplied by such third-party suppliers,
we are exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products. In addition, we are exposed to potential claims arising
from the conduct of our employees, and other subcontractors, for which we may be contractually liable.

We have in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to liabilities in connection with injury, death, or

damage incurred in conjunction with the installation of our products. Although we currently maintain what we believe
to be suitable and adequate insurance, we may be unable to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms or such
insurance may not provide adequate protection against potential liabilities.

Such claims and legal proceedings can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management

and other personnel for significant periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome. In addition, lawsuits relating
to construction defects typically have statutes of limitations that can run as long as ten years. Claims of this nature
could also have a negative impact on customer confidence in our businesses and services. Current or future claims
could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, consolidated financial condition and results of
operations.

**_We are and may become subject to periodic regulatory proceedings, including Fair Labor Standards Act and state_**
**_wage and hour class action lawsuits, which may adversely affect our business and financial performance._**

Pending and future wage and hour litigation, including claims relating to the Fair Labor Standards Act,

analogous state laws, or other state wage and hour laws could result in significant attorney fees and settlement costs.
Resolution of non-litigated alleged wage and hour violations could also negatively impact our performance. The
potential settlement of, or awards of damages for, such claims also could materially impact our financial performance
as could operational adjustments implemented in response to a settlement, court order or in an effort to mitigate future
exposure. Additionally, an increased volume of alleged statutory violations or matters referred to an agency for
potential resolution could result in significant attorney fees and settlement costs that could, in the aggregate, materially
impact our financial performance.

33


-----

**_obligations._**


If we do not meet our contractual obligations, our customers may look to us to pay damages or pursue other

remedies, including, in some instances, the payment of liquidated damages. Additionally, if we fail to meet our
contractual obligations, or if our customer anticipates that we cannot meet our contractual obligations, our customers
may, in certain circumstances, seek reimbursement from us to cover the incremental cost of having a third party
complete or remediate our work. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are required to pay
damages or incur costs as a result of a failure to meet our contractual obligations.

**Risks Related to the Industries in Which We Operate**

**_We have significant operations in the construction industry, which is highly competitive, and our failure to_**
**_effectively compete could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance._**

The construction industry is highly fragmented, and we compete with other companies in each of the markets

in which we operate, ranging from small independent firms servicing local markets to larger firms servicing regional
and national markets. We also compete with existing and prospective customers who perform some of the services
we offer, which could reduce the amount of services we perform for our customers. There are relatively few barriers
to entry for certain of the services we provide and, as a result, any organization that has adequate financial resources
and access to technical expertise and skilled personnel may become a competitor. Further, smaller competitors are
more susceptible to consolidation. Consolidation of smaller entities could create larger national competitors which
could adversely affect our business or profitability.

Most of our customers’ work is awarded through proposal processes. Consequently, price is often a

significant factor that determines whether we are awarded the project, especially on smaller, less complex projects.
Smaller competitors may have an advantage against us based on price alone due to their lower costs and financial
return requirements. Additionally, our proposals for certain projects may depend on customer perception, including
our perceived relative ability to perform the work as compared to our competitors or a customer’s perception of
technological advantages held by our competitors as well as other factors. Our market share and results of operations
could be materially and adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in proposing on projects or renewing our master
service agreements, or if our ability to be awarded such projects or agreements requires that we accept less desirable
terms, including lower margins.

**_Our businesses are dependent on levels of construction activity and an economic downturn in that industry could_**
**_materially and adversely affect our business._**

The demand for our services – including without limitation general construction, safety services, electrical

utility transmission buildouts, grid connections, and pipeline construction – is substantially dependent upon the
existence of construction projects across multiple markets including energy and infrastructure, commercial, and
industrial. Any period of economic recession affecting the volume or size of those projects is likely to adversely
impact our business. Many of the projects that require our services involve long timelines from conception to
completion, and many of the services that we offer are required later in the project’s lifecycle. Consequently, some
of our businesses experience the results of economic trends later in an economic cycle.

The construction industry and individual markets within that industry have historically been vulnerable to

macroeconomic downturns and we expect that will continue to be the case. The industry is traditionally cyclical in
nature and economic downturns can adversely affect the willingness and ability of our customers to commit to capital
expenditures. Such a decline would likely reduce the demand for certain of our services.

For example, the market for hydrocarbons has historically experienced significant volatility since 2015 and

this volatility has continued during the COVID-19 pandemic. To the extent that energy producers reduce exploration,
development or refining activities in response to changes in their respective markets, the demand for our services
would be adversely affected. In the past, reductions in new housing starts have also negatively affected the
construction industry. Generally, when demand for our services is reduced, it leads to greater price competition and
decreased revenue and profit, any of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity.

34


-----

**_conditions at project sites and other variations, the combined effects of which can potentially delay cash flows and_**
**_adversely impact our results of operations._**

Our revenue and results of operations can be subject to seasonal and other variations. These variations are

influenced by various factors, including weather, customer spending patterns, proposal seasons, project schedules,
holidays and timing, in particular, for large, non-recurring projects. In particular, many of the construction projects
that demand our services include significant portions of outdoor work. As a result, seasonal changes and adverse
weather conditions can adversely affect our business operations through declines in demand for our services and
alterations and delays in applicable schedules. Adverse weather conditions such as extended rainy and cold weather
in the spring and fall can reduce demand for our products and reduce sales or render our contracting operations less
efficient resulting in under-utilization of crews and equipment and lower contract profitability. Although our projects
are geographically dispersed across the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and Europe, extreme weather patterns or events such
as hurricanes, tornadoes, tropical storms and heavy snows could also adversely impact a substantial number of projects
and affect our revenues and profitability. Warmer and drier weather during the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal
year typically results in higher activity and revenues during those quarters. Our first and second fiscal quarters
typically have lower levels of activity due to weather conditions. A cool, wet spring increases drying time on projects,
which can delay sales in our third fiscal quarter, while a warm dry spring may enable earlier project startup.

Furthermore, the industries we serve can be cyclical in nature. Fluctuations in end-user demand within those

industries, or in the supply of services within those industries, can affect demand for our services. As a result, our
business may be adversely affected by industry declines or by delays in new projects. Variations or unanticipated
changes in project schedules in connection with large construction and installation projects can create fluctuations in
revenue and could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

**_Our ability to collect payments on contracts (at milestones, modifications, and completion) is often dependent on_**
**_the occurrence of a preceding payment to our customer (by, for example, a project owner or general contractor)_**
**_and on the financial health of our customer. Our inability to collect could negatively affect our business._**

At times, it can be difficult for us to collect payments owed to us by customers. Slowing conditions in the

overall economy or in the industries we serve, customer difficulties in obtaining project financing, and bankruptcies
at times could impair the financial condition of one or more of our customers and hinder their ability to pay us on a
timely basis or at all. In certain cases, our clients are project-specific entities that do not have significant assets other
than their interests in the project. To the extent that any of our contracts require customers to pay at specific milestones
or at the end of a project, our ability to timely identify these difficulties and pare back our expenses and resources
could be further impaired. In the past, we incurred losses after customers filed for bankruptcy or experienced financial
difficulties following a general economic downturn, in which certain industry factors worsened the effect of the overall
economic downturn on those customers. In difficult economic times, some of our clients may find it difficult to pay
for our services on a timely basis, increasing the risk that our accounts receivable could become uncollectible and
ultimately be written off. Even mere delays in client payments may require us to make a working capital investment,
which could negatively affect our cash flows and liquidity. If a client fails to pay us on a timely basis or defaults in
making payments on a project for which we have devoted significant resources, it could materially and adversely
affect our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.

We routinely present contract change orders to our clients and subcontractors for changes in contract

specifications or requirements, and at times the work specified in the change order is performed before the change
order is executed. Claims can also be caused by non-customer-caused changes, such as rain or other weather delays.
In some cases, settlement of contract modifications may not occur until after completion of work under the contract.
A failure to promptly negotiate and execute substantial or multiple contract modifications could negatively impact our
cash flows, and reductions in our ability to recover contract modifications could have a negative impact on our
consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_A failure in the systems we construct and install, whether due to employee acts or omissions or faulty workmanship_**
**_or design, may subject us to significant liability._**

Our business involves professional judgments regarding the planning, design, development, construction,

operations and management of electric power transmission, communications and pipeline infrastructure. Because our
projects are often technically complex, our failure to make judgments and recommendations in accordance with
applicable professional standards, including engineering standards, could result in damages. A significantly adverse
or catastrophic event at a project site or completed project resulting from the services we performed could result in

35


-----

claims or other claims against us, as well as reputational harm. These liabilities could exceed our insurance limits or
could impact our ability to obtain third-party insurance in the future. In addition, customers, subcontractors or
suppliers who have agreed to indemnify us against any such liabilities or losses might refuse or be unable to pay us.
An uninsured claim, either in part or in whole, if successful and of a material magnitude, could have a substantial
impact on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Because many of our services are intended to protect lives and real and personal property, we may have

greater exposure to litigation risks than businesses that provide other services. For example, with respect to our safety
services, we could face liability for failure to respond adequately to alarm activations, failure of our safety systems to
operate as expected, or losses caused by erroneous alarm activations. Many of our businesses perform services at
large projects and industrial facilities where accidents or system failures can be disastrous and costly. The nature of
the services we provide exposes us to the risks that we may be held liable for employee acts or omissions, faulty
construction or system failures. We work to include contractual provisions limiting our liability for our installation
and monitoring services, and we typically maintain liability insurance to cover losses if our services fail to satisfy
applicable requirements and standards. However, in the event of litigation, it is possible that contract limitations may
be deemed inapplicable or unenforceable, that our insurance coverage is insufficient, or that insurance carriers deny
coverage of our claims. Any claim, regardless of its merit or eventual outcome, could result in substantial costs, divert
management’s attention and create negative publicity, particularly for claims relating to environmental matters where
the amount of the claim could be extremely large. As a result, such employee acts or omissions, faulty construction
or system failures could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows. If a customer or third party believes that he or she has suffered harm to person or property
due to an actual or alleged act or omission of one or more of our employees, faulty construction, or a failure of a
system we installed, then they may pursue legal action against us.

Under our contracts with customers, we may guarantee the work performed against, among other things,

defects in workmanship, and we may agree to indemnify our customers for losses related to our services and materials.
As much of the work we perform is inspected by our customers for any defects in construction prior to acceptance of
the project, the claims that we have historically received have not been substantial. Additionally, materials used in
construction are often provided by the customer or are warranted against defects by the supplier. If customer claims
occur, we generally would be obligated to re-perform the services and/or repair or replace the item and any other
facilities impacted thereby, at our sole expense, and we could also be responsible for other damages if we are not able
to adequately satisfy customer claims. In addition, we may be required under contractual arrangements with our
customers to honor any defects or failures in materials we provide. While we generally require the materials suppliers
to provide us warranties or indemnification that are consistent with those we provide to our customers, if any of these
suppliers default on their obligations to us, we may incur costs to repair or replace the defective materials. Costs
incurred as a result of claims could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows.

**_Our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities and increased environmental_**
**_regulations could result in increased costs._**

We often perform services in and around environmentally-sensitive areas. These areas include underground

environments and areas in proximity to rivers, lakes and wetlands. Likewise, we perform directional drilling
operations below certain environmentally-sensitive terrains and water bodies. It is possible that such directional
drilling may cause a surface fracture, resulting in the release of subsurface materials. These subsurface materials may
contain contaminants in excess of amounts permitted by law, potentially exposing us to remediation costs and fines.

Our work may also cause unanticipated environmental damage or risks to employees, customers, or public

health. If the field location maps supplied to us are not accurate, or if objects are present in the soil that are not
indicated on the field location maps, our underground work could strike objects in the soil, some of which may contain
pollutants. These objects may also rupture, resulting in the discharge of pollutants. In such circumstances, we may
be liable for fines and damages, and we may be unable to obtain reimbursement from the parties providing the incorrect
information. Additionally, we own and lease several facilities at which we store our equipment. Some of these
facilities contain fuel storage tanks that are above or below ground. If these tanks were to leak, we could be responsible
for the cost of remediation as well as potential fines.

This work subjects us to various environmental laws and regulations, including those dealing with the

handling and disposal of waste products, PCBs, industrial chemicals, fuel storage, water quality and air quality. New
laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown

36


-----

new clean-up requirements could require us to incur significant costs or become the basis for new or increased
liabilities that could negatively impact our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows. In certain instances, we have obtained indemnification or covenants from third parties (including predecessors
or lessors) for such clean-up and other obligations and liabilities. However, such third-party indemnities or covenants
may not cover all of our costs and the indemnitors may not pay amounts owed to us, and such unanticipated obligations
or liabilities, or future obligations and liabilities, may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify
or be indemnified for all potential environmental liabilities relating to any acquired business.

**_Certain of our businesses are party to asbestos-related litigation that could adversely affect our consolidated_**
**_financial condition, results of operations and cash flows._**

Certain of our businesses, along with numerous other third parties, are named as defendants in personal injury

lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos containing materials. These cases typically involve product liability
claims based primarily on allegations of sale, distribution, installation or use of industrial products that either contained
asbestos or were used with asbestos containing components. We cannot predict with certainty the extent to which we
will be successful in litigating or otherwise resolving lawsuits in the future and we continue to evaluate different
strategies related to asbestos claims filed against us including entity restructuring and judicial relief. Unfavorable
rulings, judgments or settlement terms could have a material adverse impact on our business and consolidated financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The amounts we have recorded for asbestos-related liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial

position are based on our current strategy for resolving asbestos claims, currently available information, and a number
of variables, estimates and assumptions. Key variables and assumptions include the number and type of new claims
that are filed each year, the average cost of resolution of claims, the identity of defendants and the resolution of
coverage issues with insurance carriers, amount of insurance, and the solvency risk with respect to our insurance
carriers. Many of these factors are closely linked, such that a change in one variable or assumption will impact one
or more of the others, and no single variable or assumption predominately influences the determination of our asbestosrelated liabilities and insurance-related assets. Furthermore, predictions with respect to these variables are subject to
greater uncertainty in the later portion of the projection period. Other factors that may affect our liability and cash
payments for asbestos-related matters include uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to
jurisdiction and from case to case, reforms of state or federal tort legislation and the applicability of insurance policies
among subsidiaries. As a result, actual liabilities or insurance recoveries could be significantly higher or lower than
those recorded if assumptions used in our calculations vary significantly from actual results. If actual liabilities are
significantly higher than those recorded, the cost of resolving such liabilities could have a material adverse effect on
our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.


**Risks Related to Our Organizational Structure**


**_We operate as a holding company and our principal source of operating cash is income received from our_**
**_subsidiaries._**

We have a holding company structure and do not have any material assets or operations other than ownership

of equity interests of our subsidiaries. Our operations are conducted almost entirely through our subsidiaries, and our
ability to generate cash to meet our obligations or to pay dividends is highly dependent on the earnings of, and receipt
of funds from, our subsidiaries through dividends or intercompany loans. As a result, we are dependent on the income
generated by our subsidiaries to meet our expenses and operating cash requirements. The amount of distributions and
dividends, if any, which may be paid from APG and its subsidiaries to us will depend on many factors, including
APG’s results of operations and consolidated financial condition, its constitutional documents, documents governing
any indebtedness of us or APG, limits on dividends under applicable law, and other factors which may be outside of
our control. If our subsidiaries are unable to generate sufficient cash flow, we may be unable to pay our expenses or
make distributions and dividends on the Common Stock.

**_Delaware law and our organizational documents contain certain provisions, including anti-takeover provisions,_**
**_which limit the ability of stockholders to take certain actions and could delay or discourage takeover attempts that_**
**_stockholders may consider favorable._**

Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and the Delaware General Corporate Law (“DGCL”), contain

provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying, or preventing an acquisition deemed

-----

could also make it difficult for stockholders to take certain actions, including electing directors who are not nominated
by the current members of our Board of Directors or taking other corporate actions, including effecting changes in our
management. These provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or
changes in our Board of Directors or management.

In addition, Section 203 of the DGCL restricts certain “business combinations” with “interested

stockholders” for three years following the date that a person becomes an interested stockholder unless: (1) the
“business combination” or the transaction which caused the person or entity to become an interested stockholder is
approved by the Board of Directors prior to such business combination or transactions; (2) upon the completion of the
transaction in which the person or entity becomes an “interested stockholder,” such interested stockholder holds at
least 85% of our voting stock not including (i) shares held by officers and directors and (ii) shares held by employee
benefit plans under certain circumstances; or (3) at or after the person or entity becomes an “interested stockholder,”
the “business combination” is approved by the Board of Directors and holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding
voting stock, excluding shares held by such interested stockholder. A Delaware corporation may elect not to be
governed by Section 203. We have not made such an election.

**_Our securityholders may be required to bring certain actions or proceedings relating to us in the Delaware Court_**
**_of Chancery and certain actions asserting claims arising under the Securities Act in the federal district courts of_**
**_the United States._**

Pursuant to our certificate of incorporation, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the Delaware

Court of Chancery is the sole and exclusive forum for: (1) derivative actions or proceedings brought on behalf of us;
(2) actions asserting a claim of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or employees to us or our
stockholders; (3) civil actions to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of the our certificate of
incorporation or bylaws; or (4) actions asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Under our certificate
of incorporation, if the Delaware Court of Chancery lacks jurisdiction over any of the foregoing actions or proceedings,
then the sole and exclusive forum for such actions or proceedings will be another state or federal court located in the
State of Delaware, as long as such court has jurisdiction over the parties. These Delaware forum provisions require
our stockholders to bring certain types of actions and proceedings relating to Delaware law in the Delaware Court of
Chancery or another state or federal court located in the State of Delaware and therefore may prevent our stockholders
from bringing such actions or proceedings in another court that a stockholder may view as more convenient, costeffective or advantageous to the stockholder or the claims made in such action or proceeding, or may discourage them
from bringing such actions or proceedings.

In addition, pursuant to our certificate of incorporation, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum,

the U.S. federal district courts will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum
for any action asserting a claim arising under the Securities Act. This forum provision prevents our securityholders
from bringing claims arising under the Securities Act in state court, which court our securityholders may view as more
convenient, cost effective or advantageous to the claims made in such action and therefore may discourage such
actions. In addition, while the Delaware Supreme Court has recently upheld provisions of the certificates of
incorporation of other Delaware corporations that are similar to this forum provision, a court of a state other than the
State of Delaware could decide that such provisions are not enforceable under the laws of that state.

Neither the Delaware nor the Securities Act forum provisions are intended by us to limit the forums available

to our stockholders for actions or proceedings asserting claims arising under the Exchange Act.

**General Risk Factors**

**_In the event of a cybersecurity incident, we could experience operational interruptions, incur substantial additional_**
**_costs, become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings or suffer damage to our reputation._**

In addition to the disruptions that may occur from interruptions in our information technology systems,

cybersecurity threats and sophisticated and targeted cyberattacks pose a risk to our information technology systems
and the systems that we design and install. We have established security policies, processes and defenses designed to
help identify and protect against intentional and unintentional misappropriation or corruption of our information
technology systems, disruption of our operations or the secure operation of the systems we install. Despite these
efforts, our information technology systems may be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by unauthorized
access, malicious software, computer viruses, undetected intrusion, hardware failures or other events, and in these
circumstances our disaster recovery plans may be ineffective or inadequate. These breaches or intrusions could lead

38


-----

reputation, exposure to legal and regulatory proceedings and other costs. Such events could have a material adverse
impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we could be
adversely affected if any of our significant customers or suppliers experiences any similar events that disrupt their
business operations or damage their reputation. We maintain monitoring practices and protections of our information
technology to reduce these risks and test our systems on an ongoing basis for potential threats. There can be no
assurance, however, that our efforts will prevent the risk of a security breach of our databases or systems that could
adversely affect our business.

**_Our financial results are based, in part, upon estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results. In_**
**_addition, changes in accounting principles may cause unexpected fluctuations in our reported financial_**
**_information._**

In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, our management made a

number of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes. These estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information used in the
preparation of our consolidated financial statements is either dependent on future events or cannot be calculated with
a high degree of precision from data available. In some cases, these estimates are particularly uncertain, and we must
exercise significant judgment. Furthermore, some of the inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining the
fair value of our reporting units are outside the control of management, including interest rates, cost of capital, tax
rates, industry growth, credit ratings, foreign exchange rates, and labor inflation. Key estimates include: the
recognition of revenue and project profit or loss, which we define as project revenue, less project costs of revenue,
including project-related depreciation, in particular, on construction contracts accounted for under the cost-tocost method, for which the recorded amounts require estimates of costs to complete and the amount of variable
consideration included in the contract transaction price; allowances for doubtful accounts; fair value estimates,
including those related to acquisitions, valuations of goodwill and intangible assets, acquisition-related contingent
consideration and equity investments; asset lives used in computing depreciation and amortization; fair values of
financial instruments; self-insurance liabilities; other accruals and allowances; income taxes; and the estimated effects
of litigation and other contingencies. Actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that
we use, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.

In addition, accounting rules and regulations are subject to review and interpretation by the Financial

Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”), the SEC and various other governing bodies. A change in U.S. GAAP
could have a significant effect on our reported financial results. Additionally, the adoption of new or revised
accounting principles could require that we make significant changes to our systems, processes and controls. We
cannot predict the effect of future changes to accounting principles, which could have a significant effect on our
reported financial results and/or our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.

**_The loss of key senior management personnel or the failure to hire and retain highly skilled personnel could_**
**_negatively affect our business._**

We depend on our senior management and other key personnel to operate our businesses. We also rely on

other highly skilled personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in our industries, especially with respect to
specialized projects or unique skill sets in applicable trades, is intense. The loss of any of our executive officers or
other key employees or the inability to identify, hire, train, retain, and manage skilled personnel, could harm our
business.


**_Increases in healthcare costs could adversely affect our financial results._**


The costs of providing employee medical benefits have steadily increased over a number of years due to,

among other things, rising healthcare costs and legislative requirements. Because of the complex nature of healthcare
laws, as well as periodic healthcare reform legislation adopted by Congress, state legislatures, and municipalities, we
cannot predict with certainty the future effect of these laws on our healthcare costs. Continued increases in healthcare
costs or additional costs created by future health care reform laws adopted by Congress, state legislatures, or
municipalities could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position.

**_could harm our reputation, damage our relationships with customers, reduce our revenue and profits, and subject_**
**_us to criminal and civil enforcement actions._**

Misconduct, fraud, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or other improper activities by one

or more of our employees, subcontractors or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and
reputation. Examples of such misconduct include employee or subcontractor theft, the failure to comply with safety
standards, laws and regulations, customer requirements, environmental laws and any other applicable laws or
regulations. While we maintain policies and procedures to prevent and detect these activities, such precautions may
not be effective and are subject to inherent limitations, including human error and malfeasance. The failure of any of
our employees to comply with applicable laws or regulations or other acts of misconduct could subject us to fines and
penalties, harm our reputation, damage our relationships with customers, reduce our revenue and profits and subject
us to criminal and civil enforcement actions.

**_Our long-term success depends, in part, on the quality and safety of the services we provide and systems we install._**
**_A deterioration in the quality or reputation of our businesses could have an adverse impact on our reputation,_**
**_business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations._**

The success of each of our businesses and our ability to attract and retain customers typically depends in

large part on reputation. Such dependence makes our businesses susceptible to reputational damage and heightened
competition from other companies. Changes in management practices, or acts or omissions that adversely affect our
business, including any crime, scandal, litigation, negative publicity, catastrophic fires or similar events or accidents
and injuries can have a substantial negative impact on the operations of our businesses, and can cause a loss of
customer and prospective customer confidence. We or any of our businesses could also face legal claims and adverse
publicity from a variety of events or conditions, many of which are beyond our control. If the reputation or perceived
quality of our businesses decline, then our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations could be
adversely affected.

**_We are subject to many laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and changes to such laws_**
**_and regulations may result in additional costs and impact our operations._**

We are committed to upholding the highest standards of corporate governance and legal compliance. We are

subject to many laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We expect to be subject to various laws
and regulations that apply specifically to U.S. public companies. These include the rules and regulations of the NYSE,
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as the various
regulations, standards and guidance put forth by the SEC and other governmental agencies to implement those laws.
New laws, rules and regulations, or changes to existing laws or their interpretations, could create added legal and
financial costs and uncertainty for us. In addition, our international operations are subject to laws and regulations that
are in some cases different from those of the United States, including labor laws and laws and regulations governing
information collected from employees, customers and others, specifically the European Union’s General Data
Protection Regulation, which went into effect in May 2018. These laws and regulations, and the economic, financial,
political and regulatory impact of the U.K.’s decision to leave the European Union, could increase the cost and
complexity of doing business in the U.K. and negatively impact our financial position and results of operations. Our
efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and reporting standards may increase our general and administrative
expenses, divert management time and attention or limit our operational flexibility, all of which could have a material
adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.


**_Demand for our businesses can be materially affected by new or changed governmental regulation._**


Our customers operate in regulated industries and are subject to regulations that can change frequently and

without notice. The adoption of new laws or regulations, or changes to the enforcement or interpretation of existing
laws or regulations, could cause our customers to reduce spending on the services we provide, which could adversely
affect our revenues, results of operations, and liquidity. Delays in implementing anticipated regulations or reversals
of previously adopted regulations could adversely affect demand for our services. For example, the anticipation by
utilities that coal-fueled power plants may become uneconomical to operate because of potential environmental
regulations has increased demand for gas pipeline construction for utility customers. If these environmental
regulations are not implemented, this could reduce demand for our services.

40


-----

Our customers may consolidate, especially in periods of significant industry downturns. We expect any

customers that consolidate will take actions to harmonize pricing from their suppliers and rationalize their supply
chain, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. There can be no assurance that, following
consolidation, our large customers will continue to buy from us across different service offerings or geographic
regions, or at the same levels as prior to consolidation, which could adversely affect our business, consolidated
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**Risks Relating to the Notes**

**_We will be subject to restrictive debt covenants under the Indenture governing the Notes as well as under the Credit_**
**_Agreement that may limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and to pursue business_**
**_opportunities and activities. If we default under these covenants, we will not be able to meet our payment_**
**_obligations._**

The Indenture will, and the Credit Agreement currently does, contain a number of significant covenants that

restrict some of Holdings’ and our subsidiaries’ corporate activities, including our ability to:

    - incur or guarantee additional debt and issue certain preferred stock;

    - make restricted payments, including paying dividends or making other distributions and prepaying or
redeeming subordinated debt or equity;

    - create or incur certain liens;

    - sell, lease or transfer certain assets;

    - enter into arrangements that restrict dividends or other payments to us;

    - create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or
advances;

    - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

    - create unrestricted subsidiaries; and

    - consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets.

All of these limitations are or will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description

of Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders —Asset Sales” and “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants.” The
covenants to which we are subject could limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and our
ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest.

Our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control.

These include prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If we breach any of these covenants or
restrictions, we could be in default under Indenture. Any event of default or declaration of acceleration under our
Indenture could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments.

**_We are dependent on cash flows from our operating subsidiaries to fund our debt obligations, capital expenditures_**
**_and ongoing operations._**

We do not have any material assets or operations other than ownership of equity interests of our subsidiaries.

Our operations are conducted almost entirely through our subsidiaries, and our ability to generate cash to meet our
obligations or to pay dividends, if any, is highly dependent on the earnings of, and receipt of funds from, our
subsidiaries through dividends or intercompany loans. As a result, we are dependent on the income generated by our
subsidiaries, and to some degree on our ability to repatriate earnings from our foreign operations effectively, to meet
our debt service obligations, expenses and operating cash requirements. The amount of distributions and dividends, if
any, which may be paid to us from each of our subsidiaries depends on many factors, including the results of operations
and financial condition of our subsidiaries, limits on dividends or otherwise under applicable law, constitutional
documents of our subsidiaries, documents governing their indebtedness, and other factors which may be outside our
control. If our subsidiaries are unable to generate sufficient cash flows or if we are unable to repatriate earnings

requirements. subsidiaries.


Our ability to service our indebtedness, including the Notes, may depend on the results of operations of our

subsidiaries and upon the ability of such subsidiaries to provide us with cash, whether in the form of dividends, loans
or otherwise, to pay amounts due on our obligations, including the Notes. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct
legal entities and other than the subsidiaries that guarantee the Notes have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to
make payments on the Notes or to make any funds available for that purpose. In addition, dividends, loans or other
distributions to us from our non-guarantor subsidiaries may be subject to contractual and other restrictions and are
subject to other business considerations. As of March 31, 2021, accounts receivable, inventory and fixed assets,
collectively, for the Issuer and the guarantors of the Notes were approximately $877 million, which was approximately
86.5% of the same class of assets of the Company as a whole as of March 31, 2021. As of March 31, 2021, as adjusted
to give pro forma effect to this offering and the application of proceeds as described under “Use of Proceeds,” our
non-guarantors would have had approximately $2 million of indebtedness.

**_An event of default under either of our Credit Agreement or Indenture could cause an event of default under the_**
**_other, and if our debts under the Credit Agreement and Notes were accelerated, our assets may be insufficient to_**
**_repay our debts in full._**

Our Credit Agreement contains, and the Indenture will contain, a number of significant covenants that restrict

Holdings’ and some of its subsidiaries’ corporate activities. Our ability to comply with these covenants and
restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control. If we breach any of these covenants or restrictions, we
could be in default under our Credit Agreement. This would permit the lenders to take certain actions, including
declaring all amounts that we have borrowed under our Credit Agreement to be due and payable, together with accrued
and unpaid interest. A failure to pay such amounts would also result in an event of default under the Indenture. If we
are unable to repay our debt to the lenders, they could proceed against the collateral that secures the debt under our
Credit Agreement. If the debt under our Credit Agreement, the Notes, or any other material financing arrangement
that we enter into were to be accelerated, our assets may be insufficient to repay in full the Notes and our other debt.
In addition, any event of default or declaration of acceleration under one debt instrument could also result in an event
of default under one or more of our other debt instruments.

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to existing and future liabilities and other indebtedness of our_**
**_subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes._**

The Notes will be guaranteed only by Holdings’ direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries that guarantee the

Credit Agreement from time to time with certain permitted exceptions. The Notes will be structurally subordinated
to all existing and future liabilities of any of Holdings’ existing non-guarantor subsidiaries and all liabilities of any of
Holdings’ future non-guarantor subsidiaries. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or dissolution of any of our
non-guarantor subsidiaries, holders of their indebtedness, their trade creditors and holders of their preferred equity
will generally be entitled to payment on their claims from assets of those non-guarantor subsidiaries before any assets
are made available for distribution to the Issuer or a guarantor of the Notes.

As of March 31, 2021, accounts receivable, inventory and fixed assets, collectively, for the Issuer and the

guarantors of the Notes were approximately $877 million, which is approximately 86.5% of the same class of assets
of the Company as a whole as of March 31, 2021. The amount is derived from the unaudited general ledgers
maintained by the Issuer. For the three months ended March 31, 2021 and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020,
the combined net sales of the Issuer and the guarantor subsidiaries, including net sales to non-guarantor subsidiaries,
were approximately $706 million, or approximately 87.9% of net sales, and $3,224 million, or approximately 89.9%
of net sales, respectively. Dividends, loans or other distributions to us from such subsidiaries may be subject to
contractual and other restrictions and are subject to other business considerations. As of March 31, 2021, as adjusted
to give pro forma effect to this offering and the application of proceeds as described under “Use of Proceeds,” our
non-guarantor subsidiaries would have had approximately $2 million of indebtedness.

**_The Notes are unsecured and will be effectively subordinated to our 2020 Term Loan and 2019 Term Loan, to the_**
**_extent of the value of the collateral securing the 2020 Term Loan and the 2019 Term Loan._**

Our obligations under the Notes will be unsecured and will be effectively subordinated to our secured

indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such secured indebtedness. Borrowings under the
2020 Term Loan and the 2019 Term Loan are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Issuer, Holdings and

42


-----

restricted subsidiaries owned by the Issuer or the guarantors.


If an event of default occurs under the Credit Agreement, the holders of such senior secured indebtedness

will have a priority right to our secured assets, to the exclusion of the holders of the Notes, even if we are in default
with respect to the Notes. In that event, our secured assets would first be used to repay in full all indebtedness and
other obligations secured by them (including all amounts outstanding under the 2020 Term Loan and 2019 Term
Loan), resulting in all or a portion of our assets being unavailable to satisfy the claims of the holders of the Notes and
other unsecured indebtedness. Therefore, in the event of any distribution or payment of our assets in any foreclosure,
dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization, or other bankruptcy proceeding, holders of the Notes will
participate in our remaining assets ratably with each other and with all holders of our unsecured indebtedness that is
deemed to be of the same class as the Notes, and potentially with all of our other general creditors, based upon the
respective amounts owed to each holder or creditor. In any of the foregoing events, we cannot assure you that there
will be sufficient assets to pay amounts due on the Notes. As a result, holders of such Notes may receive less, ratably,
than holders of secured indebtedness.

As of March 31, 2021, as adjusted to give pro forma effect to this offering and the application of proceeds as

described in “Use of Proceeds,” the Issuer and the guarantors would have had total indebtedness of $1.4 billion other
than the Notes, all of which ranks senior in right of payment with the Notes. In addition, as of March 31, 2021 on a
pro forma basis after giving effect to this offering, we would have had an additional $300 million of availability to
incur additional secured indebtedness under our Revolving Credit Facility (excluding $73 million of letters of credit).
In addition, we are permitted to add incremental facilities under the Credit Agreement, subject to certain conditions
being satisfied. The Indenture will also permit us to incur additional secured indebtedness, which could be substantial.

**_The Indenture does not fully prohibit us from incurring substantial additional indebtedness, which could further_**
**_exacerbate the risks that we may face._**

Despite our current indebtedness levels, Holdings and its subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially

more debt in the future and the terms of the Indenture will not fully prohibit Holdings or its subsidiaries from doing
so. The Credit Agreement permits borrowings in an aggregate amount of $1.75 billion, consisting of a Revolving
Credit Facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $300 million and term loans in an aggregate principal amount
of up to $1.45 billion. If new debt is added to Holdings’ and its subsidiaries’ current debt levels, the related risks that
Holdings and they face could be exacerbated. See “Risk Factors—Financial Risks—We may incur substantial
additional indebtedness, which could further exacerbate the risks that we may face” for a description of the potential
effects of an increase in our indebtedness, and “Description of Other Indebtedness—Credit Agreement” for a
description of the terms of our Credit Agreement.

**_We can enter into transactions like recapitalizations, reorganizations and other highly leveraged transactions that_**
**_do not constitute a change of control but that could adversely affect the holders of the Notes._**

Certain important corporate events, such as leveraged recapitalizations, may not, under the Indenture,

constitute a “change of control” that would require us to purchase the Notes, notwithstanding the fact that such
corporate events could increase the level of our indebtedness or otherwise adversely affect our capital structure, credit
ratings or the value of the Notes. Therefore, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including
acquisitions, reorganizations, refinancings or other recapitalizations, which would not constitute a change of control
requiring mandatory redemption under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding
at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings and thereby potentially adversely affect the
holders of the Notes.

**_We may redeem your Notes at our option, which may adversely affect your return._**

We may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at our option at any time or from time to time at the applicable

redemption prices described in this offering circular. Prevailing interest rates at the time we redeem the Notes may
be lower than the interest rate on the Notes. As a result, you may not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds in
a comparable security at an interest rate equal to or higher than the interest rate on the Notes. See “Description of
Notes—Optional Redemption” for a more detailed description of the conditions under which we may redeem the
Notes.

-----

**_and corresponding events of default contained in the Indenture will be suspended._**

If, at any time, the credit rating on the Notes, as determined by both Moody’s and S&P, equals or exceeds

Baa3 (or the equivalent), and BBB-1 (or the equivalent), respectively, or any equivalent replacement ratings, we will
no longer be subject to most of the restrictive covenants and corresponding events of default contained in the Indenture.
Any restrictive covenants or corresponding events of default that cease to apply to us as a result of achieving these
ratings will be restored if one or both of the credit ratings on the Notes later falls below these thresholds. However,
during any period in which these restrictive covenants are suspended, we may incur other indebtedness, make
restricted payments and take other actions that would have been prohibited if these covenants had been in effect. If
the restrictive covenants are later restored, except for the covenant described under “Description of Notes—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments,” the actions taken while the covenants were suspended will not result
in an event of default under the Indenture even if it would constitute an event of default at the time the covenants are
restored. Accordingly, if these covenants and corresponding events of default are suspended, you will have less credit
protection than you will at the time the Notes are issued.

**_We may not have the ability to raise funds necessary to finance any change of control offer required under the_**
**_Indenture and our Credit Agreement._**

If a change of control (as defined in the Indenture) occurs, we will be required to offer to purchase your Notes

at 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. If a purchase offer obligation arises under the
Indenture, a change of control could also have occurred under the Credit Agreement, which could result in the
acceleration of the indebtedness outstanding thereunder. Any of our future debt agreements may contain similar
restrictions and provisions. If a purchase offer were required under the Indenture and/or under our Credit Agreement,
we may not have sufficient funds to pay the purchase price of all debt, including the Notes, that we are required to
purchase or repay.

**_Holders of the Notes may not be able to determine when a change of control giving rise to their right to have the_**
**_Notes repurchased has occurred following a sale of “substantially all” of our assets._**

The definition of change of control in the Indenture will include a phrase relating to the sale of “all or

substantially all” of our assets. There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under
applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of the Notes to require us to repurchase its Notes as a result of a
sale of less than all our assets to another person may be uncertain. See “Description of Notes—Repurchase at the
Option of Holders—Change of Control.”

**_Federal and state laws allow courts, under certain circumstances, to void guarantees and require holders of the_**
**_Notes to return payments received from guarantors._**

The Notes will be guaranteed by all of Holdings’ direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries that guarantee our

Credit Agreement from time to time with certain permitted exceptions. The guarantees may be subject to review
under U.S. federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent conveyance laws if a bankruptcy or
insolvency proceeding or a lawsuit is commenced by or on behalf of us or one of our guarantors or by our unpaid
creditors or the unpaid creditors of one of our guarantors. Under these laws, a court could void the obligations under
the guarantees, subordinate the guarantees of the Notes to that guarantor’s other debt or take other action detrimental
to the holders of the Notes and the guarantees of the Notes, if, among other things, the guarantor, at the time it incurred
the indebtedness evidenced by its guarantee:

    - issued the guarantee to delay, hinder or defraud present or future creditors;

    - received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for issuing the guarantee at the time
it issued the guarantee;

    - was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of issuing the guarantee;

    - was engaged, or about to engage, in a business or transaction for which its remaining assets constituted

    - unreasonably small capital to carry on its business; or

44


-----

In those cases where our solvency or the solvency of one of our guarantors is a relevant factor, the measures

of insolvency will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer
has occurred. Generally, however, a party would be considered insolvent if:

    - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all of its
assets;

    - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its
probable liability on its existing indebtedness, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute
and mature; or

    - it could not pay its indebtedness as it becomes due.

We cannot be sure as to the standard that a court would use to determine whether or not a party was solvent

at the relevant time, or, regardless of the standard that the court uses, that the issuance of the guarantees would not be
voided or the guarantees would not be subordinated to the guarantors’ other debt. If such a case were to occur, the
guarantee could also be subject to the claim that, since the guarantee was incurred for our benefit and only indirectly
for the benefit of the guarantor, the obligations of the applicable guarantor were incurred for less than fair
consideration.

**_There is currently no public market for the Notes, and an active trading market may not develop for the Notes. The_**
**_failure of a market to develop for the Notes could adversely affect the liquidity and value of the Notes._**

The Notes are a new issue of securities, and there is no existing market for the Notes. We do not intend to

apply for listing of the Notes on any U.S. or foreign securities exchange or for quotation of the Notes on any automated
dealer quotation system. We have been advised by the initial purchasers that following the completion of the offering,
certain of the initial purchasers currently intend to make a market in the Notes. However, they are not obligated to do
so and any market-making activities with respect to the Notes may be discontinued by them at any time without notice.
A market may not develop for the Notes, and there can be no assurance as to the liquidity of any market that may
develop for the Notes. If an active, liquid market does not develop for the Notes, the market price and liquidity of the
Notes may be adversely affected. If any of the Notes are traded after their initial issuance, they may trade at a discount
from their initial offering price.

The liquidity of the trading market, if any, and future trading prices of the Notes will depend on many factors,

including, among other things, prevailing interest rates, our operating results, financial performance and prospects,
the market for similar securities and the overall securities market, and may be adversely affected by unfavorable
changes in these factors. Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt such as the Notes has been subject to
disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in prices. It is possible that the market for the Notes, if an active
trading market develops, will be subject to disruptions which may have a negative effect on the holders of the Notes,
regardless of our operating results, financial performance or prospects. In addition, the Indenture will allow us to
issue additional Notes in the future, which could adversely impact the liquidity of the Notes.

**_Transfers of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect their liquidity and the price at which they may_**
**_be sold._**

The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act. As a result, the Notes may not

be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements
of the Securities Act. As a result of the foregoing, your ability to resell the Notes in the public market may be limited,
which may adversely affect the size of the market for these securities and pricing on resales. Additional interest
payable in respect of the Notes is payable only under specified circumstances and may not adequately compensate
you for any loss of value or tradability or any other negative impact on the Notes that may result from the risks
described in this paragraph. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

We do not intend to apply for listing of the Notes on any U.S. or foreign securities exchange or for quotation

through an automated dealer quotation system. Therefore, an active market for the Notes may not develop or be
maintained, which would adversely affect the market price and liquidity of the Notes. In that case, holders of the
Notes may not be able to sell their Notes at a particular time or at a favorable price. The liquidity of any market for
the Notes will depend on a number of factors, including:

45


-----

    - our operating performance and financial condition;

    - the market for similar securities;

    - the interest of securities dealers in making a market in the Notes;

    - prevailing interest rates; and

    - the aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding.

Even if an active trading market for the Notes does develop, there is no guarantee that it will continue.

Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to severe disruptions that have caused
substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The market, if any, for the Notes may experience
similar disruptions, and any such disruptions may adversely affect the liquidity in that market or the prices at which
you may sell your Notes. In addition, subsequent to their initial issuance, the Notes may trade at a discount from their
initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar notes, our operating performance
and financial condition and other factors.

**_The Indenture will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and we will not be required to comply with the_**
**_provisions of the Trust Indenture Act._**

The Indenture will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and we will not be required to comply with

the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act. Therefore, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to the benefit of the
provisions and protections of the Trust Indenture Act except to the extent there are similar provisions in the Indenture.

**_Any adverse rating of the Notes may negatively affect the trading price and liquidity of the Notes._**

We may seek a rating for the Notes. A rating agency’s rating of the Notes is not a recommendation to

purchase, sell or hold any particular security, including the Notes. Such ratings are limited in scope, and do not
comment as to material risks relating to an investment in the Notes. If one or more rating agencies rates the Notes
and assigns the Notes a rating lower than the rating expected by investors, reduces its rating of the Notes below the
rating initially assigned to the Notes or announces its intention to put us on credit watch, the trading price or liquidity
of the Notes could decline.

**_Our credit ratings may not reflect all risks associated with an investment in the Notes._**

Credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our results of operations, actions that

we take, their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy.
Actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining, upgrading, or downgrading the current rating or placing
us on a watch list for possible future downgrading. Downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us
on a watch list for possible future downgrading would likely increase our cost of financing, limit our access to the
capital markets and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities, including the Notes.

-----

We estimate that the net proceeds from this offering of the Notes will be approximately $      million,

after deducting discounts to the initial purchasers and estimated offering fees and expenses. We intend to use a portion
of the net proceeds from this offering to repay all of our outstanding indebtedness under the 2020 Term Loan and the
remainder of the net proceeds to repay outstanding indebtedness under the 2019 Term Loan and for general corporate
purposes, as well as transaction fees and expenses. In addition, certain initial purchasers and/or their affiliates are
agents and/or lenders under the 2020 Term Loan and the 2019 Term Loan and therefore will receive a portion of the
net proceeds from this offering.

**Overview**

APG is a market-leading business services provider of safety, specialty and industrial services in over 200

locations, primarily in North America and with an expanding platform in Europe. APG provides statutorily mandated
and other contracted services to a strong base of long-standing customers across industries. We have a winning
leadership culture driven by entrepreneurial business leaders to deliver innovative solutions for our customers.

We operate our business under three primary operating segments which are also our reportable segments:

    - **_Safety Services – A leading provider of safety services in North America and Europe, focusing on end-_**
to-end integrated occupancy systems (fire protection solutions, HVAC and entry systems), including
design, installation, inspection and service of these integrated systems. The work performed within this
segment spans across industries and facilities and includes commercial, education, healthcare, high tech,
industrial and special-hazard settings.

    - **_Specialty Services – A leading provider of a variety of infrastructure services and specialized industrial_**
plant services, which include maintenance and repair of critical infrastructure such as underground
electric, gas, water, sewer and telecommunications infrastructure. Our services include engineering and
design, fabrication, installation, maintenance service and repair, and retrofitting and upgrading.
Customers within this segment vary from private and public utilities, communications, healthcare,
education, transportation, manufacturing, industrial plants and governmental agencies throughout the
United States.

    - **_Industrial Services – A leading provider of a variety of services to the energy industry focused on_**
transmission and distribution. This segment’s services include pipeline infrastructure, access and road
construction, supporting facilities, and performing ongoing integrity management and maintenance.

We focus on growing our recurring revenue and repeat business from our diversified long-standing customers

across a variety of end markets, which we believe provides us with stable cash flows and a platform for organic growth.
Maintenance and service revenues are generally more predictable through contractual arrangements with typical terms
ranging from days to three years, with the majority having durations of less than six months, and are often recurring
due to consistent renewal rates and long-standing customer relationships.


For financial information about our operating segments, see Note 15 – “Segment Information” to our

unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Quarterly Report.

**_Effect of Seasonality and Cyclical Nature of Business_**

Our revenue and results of operations can be subject to seasonal and other variations. These variations are

influenced by weather and include impacts of customer spending patterns, bidding seasons, project schedules, holidays
and timing, in particular, for large, non-recurring projects. Typically, our revenue is lowest in the first quarter during
the winter months in North America because cold, snowy or wet conditions can cause project delays. Revenue is
generally higher during the summer and fall months during the third and fourth quarters, due to increased demand for
our services when favorable weather conditions exist in many of the regions in which we operate. Continued cold and
wet weather can often affect second quarter productivity. In the fourth quarter, many projects tend to be completed
by customers seeking to spend their capital budgets before the end of the year, which generally has a positive effect
on our revenue. However, the holiday season and inclement weather can cause delays, which can reduce revenue and
increase costs on affected projects. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted and could continue to result
in greater seasonal and cyclical volatility than would otherwise exist under normal conditions.

Additionally, the industries we serve can be cyclical. Fluctuations in end-user demand within those

industries, or in the supply of services within those industries, can affect demand for our services. As a result, our
business may be adversely affected by industry declines or by delays in new projects. Variations or unanticipated
changes in project schedules in connection with large projects can create fluctuations in revenue.

**_Economic, Industry and Market Factors_**

We closely monitor the effects of general changes in economic and market conditions on our customers.

General economic and market conditions can negatively affect demand for our customers’ products and services,
which can affect their planned capital and maintenance budgets in certain end markets. Market, regulatory and
industry factors could affect demand for our services, including: (i) changes to customers’ capital spending plans; (ii)
mergers and acquisitions among the customers we serve; (iii) new or changing regulatory requirements or other
governmental policy changes or uncertainty; (iv) economic, market or political developments; (v) changes in
technology, tax and other incentives; and (vi) access to capital for customers in the industries we serve. Availability
of transportation and transmission capacity and fluctuations in market prices for energy and other fuel sources can
also affect demand for our services for pipeline and power generation construction services. These fluctuations, as
well as the highly competitive nature of our industries, can result, and has resulted, in lower proposals and lower profit
on the services we provide. In the face of increased pricing pressure on key materials, such as steel, or other market
developments, we strive to maintain our profit margins through productivity improvements, cost reduction programs,
pricing adjustments, and business streamlining efforts. While we actively monitor economic, industry and market
factors that could affect our business, we cannot predict the effect that changes in such factors may have on our future
consolidated results of operations, liquidity and cash flows, and we may be unable to fully mitigate, or benefit from,
such changes.

**Recent Developments**

**_Acquisitions_**

During 2021, we completed several immaterial acquisitions for consideration transferred of $7 million,

primarily made up of cash paid at closing, and the results of operations of these acquisitions are included in our
unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations from their respective dates of acquisition and were not
material. See Note 4 – “Business Combinations” to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in our
Quarterly Report for further details.

**_COVID-19 Update_**

We continue to monitor the short- and long-term impacts of COVID-19, a global pandemic that has caused

a significant slowdown in the global economy beginning in March 2020. To date, the services we provide have been
deemed to be essential in most instances under various governmental orders. However, as the COVID-19 situation
has continued to evolve, we have seen impacts on our work due to the domino effects of various local, state and
national governmental orders, including but not limited to, reduced efficiency in performing our work while adhering
to physical distancing protocols demanded by COVID-19, customers deferring inspection and service projects, and
temporary shutdowns of active projects as customers work through COVID-19 related matters. As a result, we are
experiencing delays in certain projects and disruptions to the flow of our work to meet COVID-19 working protocols.

50


-----

impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic or worsen due to surges in cases, it is possible additional projects could be
delayed indefinitely or cancelled, or that we may not be allowed access to our customers’ facilities to perform
inspection and service projects. In addition, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted and could continue
to result in greater seasonal and cyclical volatility than would otherwise exist under normal conditions.

New or extended shelter-in-place orders or closures, or outbreaks in jurisdictions in which we operate or at

our project or work sites, could have a material negative impact on our net revenues and earnings. If a large number
of our employees who are located in a particular jurisdiction or are working on a project or work site are exposed to
or infected with COVID-19 and we are unable to hire qualified personnel due to labor shortages and other impacts of
the COVID-19 outbreak, we may be required to delay projects or the provision of our services for a period of time.
This could negatively impact our revenue, have a material adverse impact on our operating results and cause harm to
our reputation.

As we have continued to monitor our activity, revenue period over period has been negatively impacted by

the level of shelter-in-place orders and outbreaks of COVID-19, causing certain customers to temporarily halt work
to implement COVID-19 working protocols and other customers have delayed or cancelled projects. Generally, during
the latter half of 2020 and continuing into first quarter 2021, we saw indications of stabilizing and some volume
improvements as our teams and customers adapted to working in the COVID-19 environment and with the easing of
some shelter-in-place orders. There can be no assurance that this trend, which would allow us to recover prior year
volume levels, will continue in a positive manner.

To date, we have been able to source the supply and materials needed for our business with minimal

disruptions. However, the continued impact of COVID-19 on our vendors is evolving and could make it difficult to
obtain needed materials and at reasonable prices. We also implemented a preemptive cost reduction plan, which saved
both expense and cash in 2020. As COVID-19 restrictions were easing and volumes were increasing from earlier
lows, these cost reductions have eased and costs were reinstated.

The United States Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has

warned that cybercriminals will take advantage of the uncertainty created by COVID-19 and federal and state
mandated quarantines to launch cybersecurity attacks. The risks could include more frequent malicious cybersecurity
and fraudulent activities, as well as schemes which attempt to take advantage of employees’ use of various
technologies to enable remote work activities. We believe the COVID-19 outbreak has incrementally increased our
cyber risk profile, but we are unable to predict the extent or impacts of those risks at this time. A significant disruption
in our information technology systems, unauthorized access to or loss of confidential information, or legal claims
resulting from violation of privacy laws could each have a material adverse effect on our business.

While we cannot estimate the duration or future negative financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on

our business, we are currently experiencing some negative impact, which we expect to continue in the future.

In prior economic downturns, the impact on our business has generally lagged against the impact of other

industries. We have no way of knowing if the economic crisis caused by COVID-19 will impact us similarly to past
economic downturns.

**_Recent Accounting Pronouncements_**

A summary of recent accounting pronouncements is included in Note 3 – “Recent Accounting

Pronouncements” to our unaudited condensed financial statements included in the Quarterly Report.

**Description of Key Line Items**

**_Net Revenues_**

Revenue is generated from the sale of various types of contracted services, fabrication and distribution. We

derive revenue primarily from services under contractual arrangements with durations ranging from days to three
years, with the majority having durations of less than six months, and which may provide the customer with pricing
options that include a combination of fixed, unit, or time and material pricing. Revenue for fixed price agreements is
generally recognized over time using the cost-to-cost method of accounting which measures progress based on the
cost incurred to total expected cost in satisfying our performance obligation.

51


-----

based on total contract costs incurred plus an agreed-upon markup. Revenue for these cost-plus contracts is recognized
over time on an input basis as labor hours are incurred, materials are utilized, and services are performed. Revenue
from wholesale or retail unit sales is recognized at a point-in-time upon shipment.

**_Cost of Revenues_**

Cost of revenues consists of direct labor, materials, subcontract costs and indirect costs related to contract

performance, such as indirect labor, supplies, tools, repairs and depreciation costs. Labor costs are considered to be
incurred as the work is performed. Subcontractor labor is recognized as the work is performed.

**_Gross Profit_**

Our gross profit is influenced by direct labor, materials and subcontract costs. Our profit margins are also

influenced by raw material costs, contract mix, weather and proper coordination with contract providers. Labor
intensive contracts usually drive higher margins than those contracts that include material, subcontract and equipment
costs.

**_Selling, General and Administrative Expenses_**

Selling expenses consist primarily of compensation and associated costs for sales and marketing personnel,

costs of advertising, trade shows and corporate marketing. General and administrative expense consists primarily of
compensation and associated costs for executive management, personnel, facility leases, outside professional fees and
other corporate expenses.

**_Amortization of Intangible Assets_**

Amortization expense reflects the charges incurred to amortize our finite-lived identifiable intangible assets,

such as customer relationships, which are amortized over their estimated useful lives. There is a portion of
amortization expense related to the backlog of intangible assets reflected in cost of revenues in the unaudited
condensed consolidated statement of operations.

**_Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets_**

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently as events and circumstances change.

Expenses for impairment charges related to the write-down of goodwill balances and identifiable intangible assets
balances are recorded to the extent their carrying values exceed their estimated fair values. Expenses for impairment
charges related to the write-down of other long-lived assets (which includes amortizable intangibles) are recorded
when triggering events indicate their carrying values may exceed their estimated fair values.

**Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates**

For information regarding our Critical Accounting Policies, see “APG Management’s Discussion and

Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies” in our Annual Report.

_Net revenues_

Net revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2021 were $803 million compared to $858 million for

the same period in 2020, a decrease of $55 million or (6.4)%. The decrease in net revenues was primarily driven by
the Industrial Services segment, which was impacted by the sale of two businesses that accounted for $38 million in
revenue during first quarter 2020, disciplined project selection resulting from our strategic focus on improving
margins, suppression of demand for our services due to a general slowing in the energy industry, and the continuing
negative impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. This change was partially offset by increased revenues in our Safety
Services and Specialty Services segments due to acquisitions that occurred primarily during the fourth quarter of 2020
and higher volumes due to project timing.

_Gross profit_

The following table presents our gross profit (net revenues less cost of revenues) and gross margin (gross

profit as a percentage of net revenues) for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively:

**Three** **Months** **Ended**

**March** **31,** **Change**

($ in millions) **2021** **2020** **$** **%**

Gross profit $ 181   $ 162   $ 19 11.7 %

Gross margin _22.5 %_ 18.9 %

Our gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was $181 million compared to $162 million for

the same period in 2020, an increase of $19 million, or 11.7%. Gross margin was 22.5%, an increase of 360 basis
points compared to prior year primarily due to a $21 million decrease in backlog amortization expense, which
positively impacted the rate by 260 basis points. We also divested two lower margin businesses during 2020 in our
Industrial Services segment, which contributed 90 basis points to the improvement. In addition, favorable mix from
a higher content of service work, higher volumes in more profitable segments, and disciplined project and customer
selection drove higher gross margin. These increases were partially offset by project delays, jobsite conditions and
suppression of demand in the energy industry.

2020, respectively:

Total operating expenses $ 183   $ 396   $ (213 ) (53.8 )%

_Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues_ _22.8 %_ _46.2 %_

Our operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2021 were $183 million compared to

$396 million for the same period in 2020, a decrease of $213 million. Operating expenses as a percentage of net
revenues were 22.8% for 2021 compared to 46.2% for 2020, improving primarily due to the $208 million impairment
charge related to goodwill and intangible assets recorded in the first quarter 2020 that did not repeat during 2021. In
addition, selling, general, and administrative expenses (excluding amortization) decreased $5 million, primarily due
to a reduction in depreciation expense and the divestiture of two businesses in the Industrial Services segment.

_Interest expense, net_

Interest expense was $15 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 relatively flat compared to

$14 million for the same period of the prior year.

_Income tax provision_

The income tax benefit for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was $6 million compared to a benefit of

$51 million in the first quarter of the prior year. The decrease in tax benefit was driven by a lower loss before income
taxes. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was 42.3%, compared to 20.9% in the first
quarter of 2020. The difference in the effective tax rate was driven by discrete and nondeductible permanent items,
which have a greater impact on the effective tax rate when income or losses are smaller. The tax law changes in the
CARES Act had an immaterial impact on the Company’s income tax provision during the three months ended
March 31, 2021. The difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 21.0%
is due to the nondeductible permanent items, state taxes and foreign earnings in jurisdictions that have higher tax rates.

_Net income as a % of Net Revenues_ _(1.0 )%_ _(22.6 )%_

_EBITDA as % of Net Revenues_ _6.4 %_ _(18.8 )%_

Our net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2021 of $8 million compared to $194 million for the same

period in 2020, an improvement of $186 million. Net loss as a percentage of net revenues for the three months ended
March 31, 2021 was (1.0)% compared to (22.6)% for the same period in 2020. The change was principally from an
impairment charge that occurred in first quarter 2020 related to goodwill and intangible assets of $208 million that did
not recur, and an improved gross margin rate and lower operating expenses (discussed above). EBITDA as a
percentage of net revenues for the first quarter 2021 was 6.4% compared to (18.8)% for the same period in 2020.
Improvements in EBITDA were primarily a result of the impairment charge of $208 million recorded in first quarter
2020 and an improved gross margin rate. See the discussion and reconciliation of our non-U.S. GAAP financial
measures below.

The following discussion breaks down the net revenues, operating income and EBITDA by operating

segment for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020.

_Safety Services_

Safety Services net revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2021 increased by $42 million, or 9.9%

compared to the same period in the prior year. This increase is primarily driven by the 2020 acquisitions, and higher
volumes from increased demand for our HVAC services, partially offset by continued negative impacts of COVID19.

Safety Services operating margin for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 was approximately

9.7% and (2.4)%, respectively. The improvement was primarily driven by an impairment charge of $34 million
recorded in the first quarter 2020 that did not recur. In addition, the improvement was impacted by favorable contract
mix which shifted to more inspection and service related work, disciplined project and customer selection, and a
decrease in amortization expense of $9 million. Safety Services EBITDA as a percentage of net revenues for the three
months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 was approximately 13.9% and 4.2%, respectively. This improvement is

mix.

_Specialty Services_

Specialty Services net revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2021 increased by $21 million, or

7.0% compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in segment revenue was primarily driven by project
timing and higher volumes of specialty fabrication projects during first quarter 2021. These increases were partially
offset by adverse jobsite conditions and project delays for certain projects.

Specialty Services operating margin for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 was approximately

(0.9)% and (45.3)%, respectively. The improvement was the result of an impairment charge of $120 million recorded
in first quarter 2020 that did not recur, and decreased amortization expense of $7 million. Our Specialty Services
EBITDA as a percentage of net revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 was approximately
6.2% and (36.0)%, respectively. This improvement is primarily related to the impairment charges recorded in first
quarter 2020 that did not recur.

_Industrial Services_

Industrial Services net revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2021 decreased by $112 million, or

(81.8)% compared to the same period in the prior year. The sale of two Industrial Services businesses accounted for
$38 million of the decline. The revenue decline was also impacted by suppression of demand for our services due to
COVID-19, strategic focus on improving margin resulting from disciplined project and customer selection, and a
general slowing in the energy industry.

Industrial Services operating margin for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 was approximately

(60.0)% and (42.3)%, respectively. The decline was primarily driven by a lower volume of projects while certain
indirect costs for leases and equipment remained consistent with prior quarters, partially offset by an impairment
charge of $49 million which was recorded in first quarter 2020 that did not recur. Industrial Services EBITDA as a
percentage of net revenues was (24.0)% and (32.8)% for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020,
respectively. This improvement is primarily related to the impairment charge of $49 million in 2020 that did not recur,
partially offset by the impacts of lower volumes described above.

**_Non-GAAP Financial Measures (Unaudited)_**

We supplement our reporting of consolidated financial information determined in accordance with U.S.

GAAP with EBITDA (defined below), which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure. We use EBITDA to evaluate
our performance, both internally and as compared with our peers, because it excludes certain items that may not be
indicative of our core operating results. Management believes this measure is useful to investors since it (a) permits
investors to view the Company’s performance using the same tools that management uses to evaluate the Company’s
past performance, reportable business segments and prospects for future performance, (b) permits investors to compare
the Company with its peers and (c) determines certain elements of management’s incentive compensation.
Specifically, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) is the measure of profitability
used by management to manage its segments and, accordingly, in its segment reporting. The Company supplements
the reporting of its consolidated financial information with EBITDA. The Company believes this non-U.S. GAAP
measure provides meaningful information and help investors understand the Company’s financial results and assess
its prospects for future performance. The Company uses EBITDA to evaluate its performance, both internally and as
compared with its peers, because it excludes certain items that may not be indicative of the Company’s core operating
results. Consolidated EBITDA is calculated in a manner consistent with segment EBITDA, which is a measure of
segment profitability.

This non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, however, has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be

considered in isolation from, a substitute for, or superior to, the related financial information that we report in
accordance with U.S. GAAP. The principal limitation of this non-U.S. GAAP financial measure is that it excludes
significant expenses that are required by U.S. GAAP to be recorded in our financial statements and may not be
comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in calculation methods. In
addition, this measure is subject to inherent limitations as it reflects the exercise of judgment by management about
which items are excluded or included in determining this non-U.S. GAAP financial measure. Investors are encouraged
to review the following reconciliation of this non-U.S. GAAP financial measure to its most comparable U.S. GAAP
financial measure and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

**_Overview_**

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from the operating activities of our consolidated subsidiaries,

available cash and cash equivalents, and our access to our Revolving Credit Facility. We believe these sources will
be sufficient to fund our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months. Although we believe we have
sufficient resources to fund our future cash requirements, there are many factors with the potential to influence our
cash flow position including weather, seasonality, commodity prices, market conditions, and prolonged impacts of
COVID-19 and shelter-in-place governmental action, over which we have no control. As of March 31, 2021, we had
$972 million of total liquidity, comprising $745 million in cash and cash equivalents and $227 million ($300 million
less outstanding letters of credit of approximately $73 million, which reduce availability) of available borrowings
under our Revolving Credit Facility. During first quarter 2021, we received approximately $230 million of cash
proceeds resulting from the exercise of approximately 60 million outstanding warrants, resulting in the issuance of
approximately 20 million shares of common stock.

Given the uncertainties regarding the COVID-19 global pandemic and in preparation for its potential

unforeseen impacts, in late March 2020, we drew down $200 million under our Revolving Credit Facility.
Subsequently, in April 2020, we repaid the full amount borrowed on the Revolving Credit Facility. As of March 31,
2021, we had $1.2 billion of indebtedness outstanding under the 2019 Term Loan, $249 million outstanding under the
2020 Term Loan, and no amounts outstanding under the $300 million Revolving Credit Facility.

We expect to continue to be able to access the capital markets through equity and debt offerings for liquidity

purposes as needed. Our principal liquidity requirements have been, and we expect will be, any deferred consideration
due to selling shareholders, including tax payments in connection therewith, for working capital and general corporate
purposes, including capital expenditures and debt service, as well as to identify, execute and integrate strategic
acquisitions and business transformation. Our capital expenditures were approximately $18 million and $11 million
in the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Our annual capital expenditures were decreased in 2020 due to the impacts of COVID-19 and may return to

pre-COVID-19 levels in future periods which we expect to be less than 2% of net revenues annually.

In December 2020, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program, authorizing the purchase

of up to an aggregate of $100 million of shares of common stock. There were no stock repurchases during first quarter
2021 under the share repurchase program, and approximately $70 million of repurchases remained authorized.

The following table summarizes net cash flows with respect to our operating, investing and financing

activities for the periods indicated:

**Three Months Ended March 31,**

($ in millions) **2021** **2020**

Net cash provided by operating activities $ 32 $ 55

Net cash used in investing activities (23 )   (15 )

Net cash provided by financing activities 223 139

Effect of foreign currency exchange rate change on cash
and cash equivalents 1 1

Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 233 $ 180

Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at the end of the period $ 748 $ 436

_Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities_

Net cash provided by operating activities was $32 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021

compared to $55 million for the same period in 2020. Cash flow from operations is primarily driven by changes in
the mix and timing of demand for our services and working capital needs associated with the various services we
provide. Working capital is primarily affected by changes in total accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued
expenses, and contract assets and contract liabilities, all of which tend to be related and are affected by changes in the
timing and volume of work performed. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven
by changes in working capital levels as the declines in net revenues during first quarter 2021 have resulted in less
impactful reductions in our working capital balances.

_Net Cash Used in Investing Activities_

Net cash used in investing activities was $23 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared

to $15 million for the same period in 2020. The increase in cash used in investing activities was attributable to an
increase in purchases of property and equipment during the current period as management enacted adjustments to
capital expenditures in response to COVID-19 during the prior year.

_Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities_

Net cash provided by financing activities was $223 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021

compared to $139 million for the same period in 2020. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was
primarily due to $230 million of proceeds from the issuance of common shares in connection with the warrant
exercises which occurred during first quarter 2021 and acquisition-related consideration payments made in the prior
year period that did not recur in first quarter 2021. During first quarter 2020, we borrowed $200 million on our
Revolving Credit Facility due to uncertainties around the future impact of COVID-19, which was repaid early in the
second quarter of 2020.

**_Credit Facilities_**

We have the Credit Agreement which provides for: (1) a term loan facility, pursuant to which we incurred

the $1.2 billion 2019 Term Loan used to fund a part of the cash portion of the purchase price in the APi Acquisition;
and the incremental $250 million 2020 Term Loan, which we used to replenish balance sheet cash utilized for
acquisitions, including the SKG Acquisition, and to pay fees and expenses related to such acquisitions and the
financing; and (2) the Revolving Credit Facility of which up to $150 million can be used for the issuance of letters of
credit. As of March 31, 2021, the Company had no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and
$227 million was available after giving effect to $73 million of outstanding letters of credit, which reduce availability.

One of our Canadian subsidiaries had a $20 million unsecured line of credit agreement with a variable interest

rate based upon the prime rate. This line of credit was closed during January 2021.

The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on

additional indebtedness, dividends and other distributions, entry into new lines of business, use of loan proceeds,
capital expenditures, restricted payments, restrictions on liens on assets, transactions with affiliates and dispositions.

_The following is a description of certain of our current indebtedness. The descriptions of the agreements_

_relating to our current indebtedness contained herein are summaries thereof and do not purport to be complete_
_descriptions of the full text of such agreements._

**Credit Agreement**

In connection with the closing of the APi Acquisition, we entered into the Credit Agreement, which we used

to fund a part of the cash portion of the purchase price in the APi Acquisition. We entered into the 2020 Term Loan
on October 22, 2020, which we used to replenish balance sheet cash utilized for acquisitions, including the SKG
Acquisition, and to pay fees and expenses related to such acquisitions and the 2020 Term Loan. The Credit Agreement
includes the Revolving Credit Facility of which up to $150 million can be used for the issuance of letters of credit. At
March 31, 2021, the Company had no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and $227 million was
available after giving effect to $73 million of outstanding letters of credit which reduce availability.

The interest rate applicable to the 2019 Term Loan and 2020 Term Loan is, at our option, either (1) a base

rate plus an applicable margin equal to 1.50% for the 2019 Term Loan and 1.75% for the 2020 Term Loan or (2) a
Eurocurrency rate (adjusted for statutory reserves) plus an applicable margin equal to 2.50% for the 2019 Term Loan
and 2.75% for the 2020 Term Loan. At our option, the interest period for a 2019 Term Loan or 2020 Term Loan that
is a Eurocurrency rate loan may be one, two, three or six months (or twelve months or any other period agreed with
the lenders under the 2019 Term Loan or our 2020 Term Loan, as applicable). Interest on the 2019 Term Loan and
2020 Term Loan is payable (1) with respect to a Eurocurrency rate loan, at the end of each interest period except that,
if the interest period exceeds three months, interest is payable every three months and (2) with respect to a base rate
loan, on the last business day of each March, June, September and December. Principal payments on the 2019 Term
Loan commenced the first quarter ending on March 31, 2020 and will be made in quarterly installments on the last
day of each fiscal quarter, for a total annual amount equal to 1.00% of the initial aggregate principal amount of the
2019 Term Loan. Principal payments on the 2020 Term Loan commenced with the first quarter ending on March 31,
2021 and will be made in quarterly installments on the last day of each fiscal quarter, for a total annual amount equal
to 1.00% of the initial aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Term Loan. The 2019 Term Loan matures on October
1, 2026 and the 2020 Term Loan matures on October 1, 2026.

**_Covenants_**

The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on

additional indebtedness, dividends and other distributions, entry into new lines of business, use of loan proceeds,
investments, restricted debt payments, restrictions on liens on assets, transactions with affiliates and dispositions. To
the extent total outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility (excluding undrawn letters of credit up to
$40 million) is greater than 30% of the total commitment amount of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company’s
first lien net leverage ratio shall not exceed (i) 4.00 to 1.00 for each fiscal quarter ending in 2021 and (ii) 3.75 to 1.00
for each fiscal quarter ending thereafter. Our first lien net leverage ratio as of March 31, 2021 was 1.75 to 1.00.

In addition, the Credit Agreement contains customary provisions relating to events of default that include,

among others, non-payment of principal, interest or fees, breach of covenants, inaccuracy of representations and
warranties, failure to make payment on, or defaults with respect to, certain other indebtedness having an aggregate
principal amount in excess of $75 million, bankruptcy and insolvency events, judgments in excess of $75 million or
that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect, change of control and certain events relating to
ERISA plans. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, and after the expiration of any applicable grace period,
payment of any outstanding loans under the Credit Agreement may be accelerated and the lenders could enforce their
security interests in the assets of the borrower and the guarantors under the Credit Agreement.

The 2020 Incremental Amendment (1) modified the negative covenants in the Credit Agreement to permit

the Company to make acquisitions of and investments in entities that would not become guarantors under the Credit
Agreement if, after giving effect to the acquisition or investment, the Company is in compliance with its guarantor
coverage ratio and the total net leverage ratio under the Credit Agreement is less than 3.25 to 1.00, giving the Company
more flexibility to make acquisitions and investments in the future, (2) modified the Credit Agreement to provide for
a guarantor coverage ratio commencing with the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2021, which requires the Company
to maintain a loan party group that represents at least 85% of the Company’s consolidated EBITDA and (3) made
other changes to the Credit Agreement to recognize the Company’s expanded non-U.S. platform.

    - will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness, claims of holders of
Preferred Stock and other liabilities of the Company’s Subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes;

    - will be senior in right of payment to any Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company; and

    - will be guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Guarantors, as described under “—
Guarantees.”

As of the date of the Indenture, all of Holdings’ Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries.” However,

under certain circumstances, we will be permitted to designate additional Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.”
Any Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not
guarantee the Notes. Unless otherwise expressly noted herein, the term “Restricted Subsidiaries” includes the
Company.

**Guarantees**

The Notes and the Obligations under the Indenture will be guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by

Holdings and each of Holdings’ direct and indirect Domestic Restricted Subsidiaries that guarantee our Senior Secured
Credit Facilities, other than any Foreign Subsidiary. Except as set forth in the next paragraph, the Guarantors, as
primary obligors and not merely as sureties, will initially jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guarantee,
on a senior unsecured basis, the performance and full and punctual payment when due, whether at maturity, by
acceleration or otherwise, of all Obligations of the Company under the Indenture and the Notes, whether for payment
of principal of, or any premium or interest on or in respect of, the Notes, fees, costs, expenses, indemnification or
otherwise, on the terms set forth in the Indenture by executing the Indenture.

62


-----

material Indebtedness, any Indebtedness under a Credit Facility or guarantees Indebtedness of the Company or any
Guarantor, will guarantee the Notes. As of the Issue Date, none of our Foreign Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes
and no Foreign Subsidiaries are expected to Guarantee the Notes in the future, but Foreign Subsidiaries may become
Guarantors at the Company’s option. Each of the Guarantees of the Notes:

    - will be a general senior unsecured obligation of each Guarantor;

    - will be effectively subordinated to such Guarantor’s Guarantee of the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such Indebtedness;

    - will be pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Senior Indebtedness of each such
Guarantor, including such Guarantor’s existing and future Obligations under the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities;

    - will be senior in right of payment to any Subordinated Indebtedness of each such Guarantor; and

    - will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness, claims of holders of
Preferred Stock and other liabilities of Subsidiaries of each Guarantor that do not Guarantee the
Notes (other than the Company).

Not all of Holdings’ Subsidiaries will be required to Guarantee the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy,

liquidation, reorganization or similar proceeding of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor
Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of
their assets to the Company or any Guarantor. As a result, all of the existing and future liabilities of these non-guarantor
Subsidiaries (other than the Company), including any claims of trade creditors, will be effectively senior to the Notes.
We will not be permitted to designate the Company or any Intermediate Parent as an “Unrestricted Subsidiary”.

The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the Guarantee

from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or similar limitation under applicable law. This provision may not,
however, be effective to protect a Guarantee from being voided under fraudulent transfer law, or may reduce the
applicable Guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its Guarantee worthless.

Any entity that makes a payment under its Guarantee will be entitled upon payment in full of all guaranteed

obligations under the Indenture to a contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such other
Guarantor’s pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the Guarantors at the time of
such payment determined in accordance with GAAP.

If a Guarantee were rendered voidable, it could be subordinated by a court to all other indebtedness (including

guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of the Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such indebtedness, a
Guarantor’s liability on its Guarantee could be reduced to zero. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—
Federal and state laws allow courts, under certain circumstances, to void guarantees and require holders of the Notes
to return payments received from guarantors.”

A Guarantee by a Subsidiary Guarantor (other than any Intermediate Parent) will provide by its terms that it

will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged with respect to the Notes upon:

(1) (a) any sale, exchange or transfer (by merger or otherwise) of the Capital Stock of

such Subsidiary Guarantor, after which the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a Restricted
Subsidiary, if such sale, exchange or transfer is made in compliance with the applicable provisions
of the Indenture;

(b) the release or discharge of the guarantee by such Subsidiary Guarantor of all

Indebtedness that resulted in the creation of such Guarantee except a discharge or release by or as a
result of payment under such guarantee (it being understood that a release subject to a contingent
reinstatement will constitute a release for the purposes of this provision);

(c) the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of such Subsidiary

Guarantor otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Indenture;

63


-----

and security, if any, granted by such Subsidiary Guarantor in connection with the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities;

(e) the designation of any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Guarantor as an

Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the provisions set forth under “—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Restricted Payments” and the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary;”

(f) the merger or consolidation of any Guarantor with and into the Company or

another Guarantor or upon the liquidation of such Guarantor following the transfer of all of its assets
to the Company or another Guarantor; or

(g) the Company exercising its defeasance option or covenant defeasance option with

respect to the Notes as described under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or the
Company’s obligations under the Indenture being discharged with respect to the Notes in accordance
with the terms of the Indenture;

and in the case of clause (c), other than to us or one of our Affiliates and as permitted by the

Indenture and we will comply with our obligations under the “Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset
Sales” covenant in respect of such disposition; and

(2) such Subsidiary Guarantor delivering to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate, stating that all

conditions precedent provided for in the Indenture relating to such release of such Guarantee have been
complied with.

The Guarantee by Holdings and any Intermediate Parent will provide by its terms that it will be automatically

and unconditionally released and discharged upon:

the exercise by the Company of its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option

as described under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or the discharge of the Company’s
obligations under the Indenture in accordance with the terms of the Indenture as described under “Satisfaction
and Discharge” or the consolidation or merger of Issuer with Holdings in a manner permitted pursuant to, the
provisions described above under “Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially
All Assets”;

such Guarantor delivering to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate, stating that all conditions

precedent provided for in the Indenture relating to such release and discharge have been complied with.

Each Guarantee will be limited to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by

that Guarantor without the Guarantee, as it relates to such Guarantor, voidable under applicable law relating to
fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally.

**Ranking**

The payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes and the payment of any Guarantee

will be pari passu in right of payment with all Senior Indebtedness of the Company or the relevant Guarantor, as the
case may be, including the obligations of the Company and such Guarantor under the Senior Secured Facilities. The
ranking of the Notes and the Guarantees is more fully described above under “Brief Description of the Notes” and
“Guarantees.”

As of March 31, 2021, the Company and the Guarantors would have had approximately $1.4 billion of

indebtedness that is effectively senior in right of payment to the Notes.

As of March 31, 2021, accounts receivable, inventory and fixed assets, collectively, for the Issuer and the

legal entities that will be guarantors of the Notes were approximately $877 million, which is approximately 86.5% of
the same class of assets of the Company as a whole as of March 31, 2021.

For the three months ended March 31, 2021 and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, the combined net

sales of the Issuer and the guarantors of the Notes, including net sales to non-guarantor subsidiaries, were
approximately $706 million, or approximately 87.9% of net sales, and $3,224 million, or approximately 89.9% of net

64


-----

combined EBITDA of the Issuer and the guarantors of the Notes, including intercompany transactions with nonguarantor subsidiaries but excluding APi Group Corporation’s corporate costs, was approximately $50 million and
$356 million, respectively.

Although the Indenture will contain limitations on the amount of additional Indebtedness that the Company

and the Guarantors may incur, under certain circumstances the amount of such Indebtedness could be substantial and,
in any case, such Indebtedness may be Senior Indebtedness. The Indenture does not limit the amount of liabilities that
are not considered Indebtedness which may be incurred by Holdings or any Restricted Subsidiary, including the
non-guarantor Subsidiaries. See “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.”

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Company will maintain one or more paying agents for the Notes. The initial paying agent for the Notes

will be the Trustee.

The Company will also maintain a registrar with respect to the Notes. The initial registrar for the Notes will

be the Trustee.

The Company may change the paying agent or the registrar without prior notice to the Holders. Holdings or

any of its Subsidiaries may act as a paying agent or registrar with respect to the Notes.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The registrar and the Trustee

may require a Holder to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents in connection with a transfer of
Notes. Holders will be required to pay all taxes due on transfer. The Company will not be required to transfer or
exchange any Note selected for redemption. Also, the Company will not be required to transfer or exchange any Note
for a period of 15 days before a selection of Notes to be redeemed.

Neither the Trustee, the Registrar nor any transfer agent shall have any obligation or duty to monitor,

determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer or exchange imposed under the Indenture or
under applicable law with respect to any transfer or exchange of any Note (including any transfers between or among
participants or other beneficial owners of interests in any global Note) other than to require delivery of such certificates
and other documentation or evidence as are expressly required by the terms of the Indenture and to examine the same
to determine substantial compliance as to form with the express requirements thereof.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Company will issue an aggregate principal amount of $300,000,000 of Notes in this offering. The Notes

will mature on     , 2029. Subject to compliance with the covenants described below under the caption “Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,” the
Company may issue additional Notes from time to time after this offering under the Indenture (any such additional
Notes, for purposes of this “Description of Notes”, “Additional Notes”). Except as otherwise provided herein, the
Notes offered hereby and any Additional Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as a single
class for all purposes under the Indenture, including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase;
_provided that if the Additional Notes are not fungible with the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the_
Additional Notes will have a separate CUSIP and/or ISIN number, if applicable. Unless otherwise specified, or the
context requires otherwise, references to “Notes” for all purposes of the Indenture and this “Description of Notes”
include any additional Notes that are actually issued. The Company will issue Notes in minimum denominations of
$2,000 (the “Minimum Denomination”) and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of      % per annum. Interest on each series of Notes will be

payable semiannually in arrears on      and      of each year, commencing on     , 2021 to the Holders of
Notes of record on the immediately preceding      and      . Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent
date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from and including the Issue Date of the Notes.
Interest on the Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

65


-----

maintained for such purpose or, at the option of the Company, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to
the Holders of the Notes at their respective addresses set forth in the register of Holders; provided that all payments
of principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to the Notes represented by one or more global notes registered
in the name of or held by DTC or its nominee will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
accounts specified by the Holder or Holders thereof. Until otherwise designated by the Company, the Company’s
office or agency will be the office of the Trustee maintained for such purpose.

**Mandatory Redemption; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases**

The Company will not be required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect

to the Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to make an offer to purchase Notes
as described under the heading “Repurchase at the Option of Holders.” In addition, Holdings, the Company and their
affiliates may, at their discretion, at any time and from time to time purchase Notes, in the open market or otherwise.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth below, the Company will not be entitled to redeem the Notes at its option prior to     ,

2024.

At any time prior to     , 2024, the Company may redeem all or a part of the Notes, upon notice as

described under “Optional Redemption—Selection and Notice” below, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of Notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to,
the date of redemption (the “Redemption Date”), subject to the rights of Holders on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date.

On and after     , 2024, the Company may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, upon notice as described

under the heading “Optional Redemption—Selection and Notice” below, at the redemption prices (expressed as
percentages of principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon,
to the applicable Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date, if redeemed beginning on      of the years indicated below:

**Date** **Percentage**

2024 ....................................................................................................................................... %

2025 ....................................................................................................................................... %

2026 and thereafter ................................................................................................................ %

In addition, until     , 2024, the Company may, at its option, on one or more occasions, redeem up to 35%

of the aggregate principal amount of Notes issued by it at a redemption price equal to      % of the aggregate
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, to, but excluding, the applicable Redemption Date,
subject to the right of Holders of Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant
interest payment date, with the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings or a contribution to the Company’s
common equity capital made with the net cash proceeds of an Equity Offering; _provided_ that at least 65% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes originally issued under the Indenture (calculated after giving effect to any
issuance of Additional Notes) remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of each such redemption;
_provided further that each such redemption occurs within 90 days of the date of closing of each such Equity Offering._

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Notes at a price of at least 100%

of the principal amount of the Notes tendered, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the applicable
tender settlement date, if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly
tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Company, or any third party making such a tender
offer in lieu of the Company, purchase all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the
Company or such third party will have the right upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not
more than 30 days following such purchase date, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase
at a price equal to the price offered to each other Holder in such tender offer plus, to the extent not included in the
tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the Redemption Date.

Notice of any redemption of the Notes may, at the Company’s discretion, be given prior to the completion of

a transaction (including an Equity Offering, an incurrence of Indebtedness, a Change of Control or other transaction)
and any redemption notice may, at the Company’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent,

66


-----

satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall describe each such condition, and if applicable,
shall state that, in the Company’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time (including more than
60 days after the date the notice of redemption was mailed or delivered, including by electronic transmission) as any
or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be
rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the
redemption date as so delayed. In addition, the Company may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption
price and performance of the Company’s obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another
Person.

Holdings, the Company and its Affiliates may acquire the Notes by any means other than a redemption,

whether by tender offer, open market purchases, negotiated transactions or otherwise.

**Selection and Notice**

If the Company is redeeming less than all of the Notes issued under the Indenture at any time, in the case of

physical Notes, the Trustee or Registrar will select the Notes to be redeemed (1) if the Company has notified the
Trustee or Registrar that the Notes are listed on an exchange, in compliance with the requirements of such exchange
or (2) on a pro rata basis in the case of physical notes to the extent practicable, or, in the case of global Notes, by such
other method as may be prescribed by DTC’s applicable procedures. No Notes of the Minimum Denomination or less
can be redeemed in part.

Notices of redemption shall be delivered electronically through DTC or mailed by first-class mail, postage

prepaid, at least 15 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes at such Holder’s
registered address or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, except that redemption notices may be
delivered more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the
Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture. The Company shall provide the notice to the Trustee of any
such redemption at least three (3) Business Days prior to when notice is due to holders. If any Note is to be redeemed
in part only, any notice of redemption that relates to such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof
that has been or is to be redeemed. With respect to Notes represented by certificated notes, the Company will issue a
Note in a principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note in the name of the Holder upon
cancellation of the original Note; provided, that new Notes will only be issued in the Minimum Denomination and
integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for
redemption, unless such redemption is conditioned on the happening of one or more future events or conditions
precedent. On and after the Redemption Date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of them called for
redemption.

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

**_Change of Control_**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless the Company has previously or

concurrently mailed a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described under “Optional
Redemption,” the Company will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the
“Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash (the “Change of Control Payment”) equal to 101% of the aggregate
principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase, subject to the right of Holders
of the Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date. Within
30 days following any Change of Control, the Company will send notice of such Change of Control Offer by first-class
mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes to the address of such Holder appearing in the security
register or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, with the following information:

that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled “Change of

Control” under the Indenture and that all Notes properly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer
will be accepted for payment by the Company;

the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 30 days nor later

than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the “Change of Control Payment Date”), except in the case
of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control as described below;

that any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest;

67


-----

Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the
Change of Control Payment Date;

that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer

will be required to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase” on the
reverse of such Notes completed, to the paying agent specified in the notice at the address specified in the
notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment
Date;

that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their election to require

the Company to purchase such Notes; provided that the paying agent receives, not later than the close of
business on the expiration date of the Change of Control Offer, an electronic transmission, facsimile
transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder of the Notes, the principal amount of Notes tendered
for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its tendered Notes and its election to have such
Notes purchased;

that if the Company is redeeming less than all of the Notes, the remaining Notes will be

equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered. The unpurchased portion of
the Notes must be equal to the Minimum Denomination or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof;

the other instructions, as determined by the Company, consistent with the covenant

described hereunder, that a Holder must follow; and

if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the

Change of Control Offer is conditional upon the occurrence of such Change of Control.

The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other

securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the
repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or
regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws
and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company will, to the extent permitted by law,

accept for payment all Notes issued by it or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to

the Change of Control Offer,

deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment

in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered, and

deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes so accepted

together with an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been
tendered to, and purchased by, the Company.

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities provide, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to

Indebtedness to which the Company becomes a party may provide, that certain change of control events with respect
to Holdings or the Company would constitute a default thereunder (including events that would constitute a Change
of Control under the Indenture). If we experience a change of control event that triggers a default under the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities or any such future Indebtedness, we could seek a waiver of such default or prepayment
provision or seek to refinance the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or such future Indebtedness. In the event we do not
obtain such a waiver or refinance the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or such future Indebtedness, such default could
result in amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or such future Indebtedness being declared
due and payable or lending commitments being terminated.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any Change of Control Offer, if Holders of not less than

90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such
tender offer and the Company, or any third party making such a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Company,
purchase all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Company or such third party will
have the right upon not less than 15 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such

68


-----

to each other Holder in such Change of Control Offer; plus, to the extent not included in the Change of Control Offer
payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the Redemption Date.

Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be

limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to
make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—We may not have the ability to raise
funds necessary to finance any change of control offer required under the Indenture and the Credit Agreement.”

The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or

discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase
feature is a result of negotiations between the Initial Purchasers and us. We have no present intention to engage in a
transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future. Subject
to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions,
refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that
could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit
ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under
“Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred
Stock” and “Certain Covenants—Liens.” However, the covenants are subject to significant exceptions. Such
restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of
the Notes, then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not
contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged
transaction.

The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if a

third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases
all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a

Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of
Control at the time of making the Change of Control Offer.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of

Holdings and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person other than a Permitted Holder. Although there is a
limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the
phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether
a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of Holdings and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and
whether a Holder of Notes may require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the

Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

**_Asset Sales_**

The Indenture will provide that Holdings will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,

consummate an Asset Sale, unless:

Holdings or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration at the

time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market value (as determined in good faith by Holdings at the
time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale) of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of; and

except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75% of the consideration therefor

received by Holdings or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash or Cash
Equivalents; provided that the following shall be deemed to be cash for purposes of this provision and for no
other purpose:

69


-----

recent balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto or, if incurred or increased subsequent to the date of
such balance sheet, such liabilities that would have been shown on Holdings’ or such Restricted
Subsidiary’s balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto if such incurrence or increase had taken place
on the date of such balance sheet, as determined by Holdings) of Holdings or such Restricted
Subsidiary (other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes) that are assumed
by the transferee of any such assets pursuant to a written agreement which releases or indemnifies
Holdings or such Restricted Subsidiary from such liabilities;

(b) any securities, notes or other similar obligations received by Holdings or such

Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by Holdings or such Restricted
Subsidiary into cash (to the extent of the cash received) within 180 days of the receipt thereof; and

(c) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by Holdings or such Restricted

Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other
Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (c) that is at that time
outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (i) $150.0 million and (ii) 40% of LTM EBITDA at the
time of the receipt of such Designated Non-cash Consideration, with the fair market value of each
item of Designated Noncash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving
effect to subsequent changes in value.

Within 450 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds of any Asset Sale, Holdings or such Restricted

Subsidiary, at its option, may apply the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale,

to permanently reduce Indebtedness as follows:

(a) to permanently reduce Secured Indebtedness, including without limitation, under

the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, in each case, which is secured by a Lien that is permitted by
the Indenture and to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto;

(b) to permanently reduce Obligations under other Senior Indebtedness of the

Company or a Guarantor (and to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto),
_provided that the Company or such Guarantor shall equally and ratably reduce (or offer to reduce,_
as applicable) Obligations under the Notes on a pro rata basis to the extent the Obligations being
reduced were incurred after the date hereof; provided further that all reductions of Obligations under
the Notes shall be made as provided under “Optional Redemption” or through open-market
purchases (to the extent such purchases are at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof plus
accrued and unpaid interest) or by making an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth
below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders of Notes to purchase their Notes at 100% of the
principal amount thereof, plus the amount of accrued but unpaid interest, if any, on the amount of
Notes that would otherwise be prepaid; or

(c) if the assets subject of such Asset Sale are the property or assets of a Restricted

Subsidiary (other than the Company) that is not a Guarantor, to permanently reduce Indebtedness
of (i) a Restricted Subsidiary (other than the Company) that is not a Guarantor, other than
Indebtedness owed to Holdings or any Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii) the Company or a Guarantor,

to make (a) an Investment in any one or more businesses; provided that such Investment in

any business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in Holdings or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business such that it
constitutes a Restricted Subsidiary, (b) capital expenditures or (c) acquisitions of other assets, in each of (a),
(b) and (c), used or useful in a Similar Business; or

to make an Investment in (a) any one or more businesses; provided that such Investment in

any business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in Holdings or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business such that it
constitutes a Restricted Subsidiary, (b) properties or (c) acquisitions of other assets that, in each of (a), (b)
and (c), replace the businesses, properties and/or assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale;

period shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment so long as
Holdings or such other Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment with the good faith expectation that such
Net Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such commitment within 180 days of such commitment (an “Acceptable
Commitment”) and, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before
the Net Proceeds are applied in (x) connection therewith or (y) such Net Proceeds are not actually so invested or paid
in accordance with clause (2) or (3) above by the end of such 180-day period, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute
Excess Proceeds.

Any Net Proceeds from the Asset Sale that are not invested or applied as provided and within the time period

set forth in the first sentence of the preceding paragraph will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds.” When the
aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $100.0 million, the Company shall make an offer to all Holders of the
Notes and if required by the terms of any Indebtedness that is pari passu with the Notes or any Guarantee (“Pari Passu
Indebtedness”), to the holders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness (an “Asset Sale Offer”), to purchase the maximum
aggregate principal amount of the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness that is an integral multiple of $1,000 (but
in minimum amounts of the Minimum Denomination) that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer
price, in the case of the Notes, in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, to the date fixed for the closing of such offer, and in the case of any Pari Passu Obligations at the offer
price required by the terms thereof but not to exceed 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture. The Company will commence an Asset
Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds within 10 Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds exceed $100.0
million by mailing the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. The Company
may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale
Offer with respect to such Net Proceeds prior to the expiration of the relevant 450 days or with respect to Excess
Proceeds of $100.0 million or less.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be,

tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, Holdings may use any remaining Excess
Proceeds for any purposes not otherwise prohibited under the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes
or Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess
Proceeds, such Notes or Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, will be purchased on a pro rata basis based on
the accreted value or principal amount of such Notes or Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered (and
the Trustee or Registrar will select the tendered Notes (in the case of physical Notes) of tendering holders on a pro
rata basis, or such basis in accordance with DTC procedures (in the case of global Notes), based on the amount of
Notes tendered). Additionally, the Company may, at their option, make an Asset Sale Offer using proceeds from any
Asset Sale at any time after consummation of such Asset Sale. Upon consummation or expiration of any Asset Sale
Offer, any Net Proceeds not used to purchase Notes in such Asset Sale Offer shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds
and Holdings may use any Net Proceeds not required to be used for general corporate purposes, subject to other
covenants contained in the Indenture.

Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds, the holder of such Net Proceeds may apply such Net

Proceeds temporarily to reduce Indebtedness outstanding under a revolving credit facility or otherwise invest such
Net Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture.

The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other

securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the
repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or
regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws
and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.

The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the

Notes as a result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

Future credit agreements or other similar agreements to which the Company becomes a party may contain

restrictions on the Company’s ability to repurchase Notes. In the event an Asset Sale occurs at a time when the
Company is prohibited from purchasing Notes, the Company could seek the consent of their lenders to the repurchase
of Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Company does not obtain
such consent or repay such borrowings, the Company will remain prohibited from repurchasing Notes. In such a case,

Default under the Indenture which would, in turn, likely constitute a default under such other agreements.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants contained in the Indenture that will apply to Holdings

and its Restricted Subsidiaries. For the avoidance of doubt, all covenant basket sizes including any definitions relating
thereto are as drafted in U.S. Dollars.

If on any date following the Issue Date (i) the Notes have Investment Grade Ratings from both Rating

Agencies, and (ii) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture then, beginning
on that day (the occurrence of the events described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to
as a “Covenant Suspension Event”) and continuing until the occurrence of the Reversion Date, if any, the covenants
specifically listed under the following captions in this “Description of Notes” section of this offering circular will not
be applicable to the Notes (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants)”:

“Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales”;

“—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

“—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and

Preferred Stock”;

clause (4) of the first paragraph of “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially

All Assets—Company”;

“—Transactions with Affiliates”; and

“—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries.”

The Company or Holdings shall give the Trustee written notice of any Covenant Suspension Event and in

any event not later than five (5) Business Days after such Covenant Suspension Event has occurred. In the absence of
such notice, the Trustee shall assume the Suspended Covenants apply and are in full force and effect. The Company
or Holdings shall give the Trustee written notice of any occurrence of a Reversion Date not later than five (5) Business
Days after such Reversion Date. After any such notice of the occurrence of a Reversion Date, the Trustee shall assume
the Suspended Covenants apply and are in full force and effect.

During any period that the foregoing covenants have been suspended, Holdings may not designate any of its

Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries pursuant to the second clause of the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary.”

If and while Holdings and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants, the Notes

will be entitled to substantially less covenant protection. In the event that Holdings and its Restricted Subsidiaries are
not subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on
any subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”) one or both of the Rating Agencies withdraw their Investment Grade
Rating or downgrade the rating assigned to the Notes below an Investment Grade Rating, then Holdings and its
Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture with respect
to future events. The period of time between the Suspension Date and the Reversion Date is referred to in this
description as the “Suspension Period.” Upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event, the amount of Excess
Proceeds from Asset Sales shall be reset to zero.

During any Suspension Period, Holdings will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into

any Sale and Lease-Back Transaction; provided, however, that Holdings or any Restricted Subsidiary may enter into
a Sale and Lease-Back Transaction if (i) Holdings or such Restricted Subsidiary could have incurred a Lien to secure
the Indebtedness attributable to such Sale and Lease-Back Transaction pursuant to “—Liens” below without equally
and ratably securing the Notes pursuant to the covenant described under such covenant; and (ii) the consideration
received by Holdings or such Restricted Subsidiary in that Sale and Lease-Back Transaction is at least equal to the
fair market value of the property sold and otherwise complies with “Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset
Sales” above; provided, further, that the foregoing provisions shall cease to apply on and subsequent to the Reversion
Date following such Suspension Period.

72


-----

extent provided for under “—Liens” (including, without limitation, Permitted Liens) to the extent provided for in such
covenant and any Permitted Liens which may refer to one or more Suspended Covenants shall be interpreted as though
such applicable Suspended Covenant(s) continued to be applicable during the Suspension Period (but solely for
purposes of the “—Liens” covenant and for no other covenant).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any such reinstatement, no action taken or omitted to be taken

by Holdings or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries during the Suspension Period will give rise to a Default or Event of
Default under the Indenture with respect to the Notes; provided that (1) with respect to Restricted Payments made
after such reinstatement, the amount of Restricted Payments made will be calculated as though the covenant described
below under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect since the Issue Date and throughout
the Suspension Period; (2) all Indebtedness incurred, or Disqualified Stock issued, during the Suspension Period will
be classified to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (3) of the second paragraph of “—Limitation on
Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock;” (3) any Affiliate Transaction
entered into after such reinstatement pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period shall be
deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (6) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—
Transactions with Affiliates”; and (4) any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary that
is not a Guarantor to take any action described in clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes
effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (a) of the second paragraph
of the covenant described under “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Ratings.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

Holdings will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

(I) declare or pay any dividend or make any payment or distribution on account of Holdings’, or any

of its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests, including any dividend or distribution payable in connection with any
merger or consolidation other than:

(a) dividends or distributions by Holdings payable solely in Equity Interests (other

than Disqualified Stock) of Holdings; or

(b) dividends or distributions by a Restricted Subsidiary so long as, in the case of any

dividend or distribution payable on or in respect of any class or series of securities issued by a
Restricted Subsidiary, Holdings or a Restricted Subsidiary receives at least its pro rata share of such
dividend or distribution in accordance with its Equity Interests in such class or series of securities;

(II) purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Equity Interests of Holdings,

or any direct or indirect parent of Holdings, including any purchase, redemption, defeasance, acquisition or retirement,

value in each case, prior to any scheduled repayment, sinking fund payment or maturity, any Subordinated

described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”
or (b) the purchase, repurchase or other acquisition of Subordinated Indebtedness purchased in anticipation of
satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each case due within one year of the
date of purchase, repurchase or acquisition; or

(IV) make any Restricted Investment;

(all such payments and other actions set forth in clauses (I) through (IV) above (other than any exceptions thereof)
being collectively referred to as “Restricted Payments”), unless, at the time of such Restricted Payment:

no Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof;

Payments made by Holdings and its Restricted Subsidiaries after the Issue Date (including Restricted

which constitute Restricted Investments by Holdings or its Restricted Subsidiaries, in each
case after the Issue Date; or

(ii) the sale (other than to Holdings or a Restricted Subsidiary) of the stock

the board of directors of Holdings and evidenced by a board resolution) of the Investment in such
Unrestricted Subsidiary at the time of the redesignation of such Unrestricted Subsidiary as a

made by Holdings or a Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to clause (7) of the next succeeding paragraph
or to the extent such Investment constituted a Permitted Investment; plus

(e) $120.0 million.

The foregoing provisions will not prohibit:

(9), (11), (14), (16) and (17), no Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a consequence
thereof.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a proposed Restricted Payment

(or a portion thereof) meets the criteria of clauses (1) through (17) above or is entitled to be made pursuant to the first
paragraph of this covenant, Holdings will be entitled to classify or later reclassify (based on circumstances existing
on the date of such reclassification) such Restricted Payment (or a portion thereof) between such clauses (1) through
(17) and such first paragraph in any manner that otherwise complies with this covenant.

If Holdings or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries become contractually obligated to make any Restricted

Payment at the time the requirements set forth in clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this section “—Limitation
on Restricted Payments” continues to be satisfied, then Holdings or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be,
may continue to make such Restricted Payments, even if such requirements cease to be satisfied at the time such
Restricted Payment is actually made and the amount available for Restricted Payments pursuant to clause (3) of the
first paragraph of this section “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” on or after the date on which such requirements
cease to be satisfied shall be equal to the amount that would have been available for Restricted Payments pursuant to
such clause (3) on such date without giving effect to any Restricted Payments made on such date pursuant to and in
compliance with this sentence.

As of the Issue Date of the Notes, all of Holdings’ Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries. Holdings will

not permit any Unrestricted Subsidiary to become a Restricted Subsidiary except pursuant to the penultimate sentence
of the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary”. For purposes of designating any Restricted Subsidiary as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary, all outstanding Investments by Holdings and its Restricted Subsidiaries (except to the extent
repaid) in the Subsidiary so designated will be deemed to be Restricted Payments in an amount determined as set forth
in the last sentence of the definition of “Investments.” Such designation will be permitted only if a Restricted Payment
in such amount would be permitted at such time, whether pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant or under
clauses (7), (10), (11) or (16) of the second paragraph of this covenant, or pursuant to the definition of “Permitted
Investment,” and if such Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. Unrestricted
Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants set forth in the Indenture. Holdings will not be
permitted to designate the Company or any Intermediate Parent as an “Unrestricted Subsidiary”.

**_Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock_**

Holdings will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur,

issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise (collectively,
“incur” and an “incurrence”) with respect to any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) and Holdings will
not issue any shares of Disqualified Stock and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to issue any shares of
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock; provided, however, that Holdings may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired
Indebtedness) or issue shares of Disqualified Stock, and subject to the second provision in this paragraph, any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries may incur indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness), issue shares of Disqualified Stock
and issue shares of Preferred Stock, if the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio on a consolidated basis for Holdings and its

in the event that an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any

portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of permitted Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock described in clauses (1) through (27) above or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to

include the amount and type of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock in one of the above

-----

Indebtedness, the U.S. Dollar equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be
calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred, in the
case of term debt, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit debt; provided that if such Indebtedness is incurred
to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable
U.S. Dollar denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on
the date of such refinancing, such U.S. Dollar denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so
long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (a) the principal amount of such
Indebtedness being refinanced, plus (b) the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums (including
tender premiums) and other costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) incurred
in connection with such refinancing.

The principal amount of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if incurred in a different

currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable
to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

The Indenture will provide that the Company will not, and will not permit any Guarantor to, directly or

indirectly, incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) that is subordinated or junior in right of payment
to any Indebtedness of the Company or such Guarantor, as the case may be, unless such Indebtedness is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or such Guarantor’s Guarantee to the extent and in the same manner as
such Indebtedness is subordinated to other Indebtedness of the Company or such Guarantor, as the case may be.

The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness

merely because it is unsecured or (2) Senior Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other Senior Indebtedness
merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral or because such other Senior Indebtedness
is guaranteed by other obligors.

**_Liens_**

Holdings will not, and will not permit the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor to, directly or indirectly,

create, incur, assume or otherwise cause or suffer to exist any Lien (except Permitted Liens) that secures obligations
under any Indebtedness or any related Guarantee of the Company or any Guarantor, on any asset or property of the
Company or any Guarantor, or any income or profits therefrom, or assign or convey any right to receive income
therefrom, unless:

in the case of any Liens securing Subordinated Indebtedness, the Notes and related

Guarantees are secured by a Lien on such property, assets or proceeds that is senior in priority to such Liens;
and

in all other cases, the Notes or the Guarantees are equally and ratably secured, except that

the foregoing shall not apply to or restrict Liens securing obligations in respect of the Notes (and exchange
notes with respect thereto) and the related guarantees.

Any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes pursuant to this covenant shall be deemed

automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the release and discharge of each of the Liens
described in clauses (1) and (2) above. If Holdings, the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor should require the
Trustee to execute any document in connection with such release and discharge of a Lien, the Company shall provide
an officer’s certificate and opinion of counsel, each stating that (i) such release and discharge is authorized or permitted
by the terms of the Indenture and Notes, and (ii) that all conditions precedent to such release and discharge have been
satisfied.

merge with or into or wind up into (whether or not Holdings or the Company, as applicable, is the surviving
corporation) or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of Holdings’ or the
Company’s properties or assets, as applicable, in one or more related transactions, to any Person unless:

the case may be, being herein called the “Successor Company”); provided that in the case where the Successor
Company is the successor to the Company and is not a corporation, a co-obligor of the Notes is a corporation;

the Successor Company, if other than Holdings or the Company, expressly assumes all the

obligations of Holdings or the Company, as applicable, under the Indenture and the Guarantee or the Notes,
as applicable, pursuant to a supplemental indenture or other documents or instruments;

would be permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first sentence of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,” or

(b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for Holdings or the Successor Company (if the

successor to Holdings) and its Restricted Subsidiaries would be equal to or greater than such Ratio
for Holdings and its Restricted Subsidiaries immediately prior to such transaction;

each Guarantor, unless (i) it is the other party to the transactions described above, in which

case subclause (b) of the second succeeding paragraph shall apply or (ii) Holdings is the surviving entity,
shall have by supplemental indenture confirmed that its Guarantee shall apply to such Person’s obligations
under the Indenture and the Notes; and

the Company or the Successor Company(if the successor to the Company) shall have

delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such
consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture, if any, complies with the Indenture.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, Holdings or the Company, as the case may

be, under the Indenture, the Guarantees and the Notes, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (3) and
(4),

any Restricted Subsidiary (other than the Company) may consolidate with or merge into or

transfer all or part of its properties and assets to Holdings, the Company or a Guarantor, and

Holdings or the Company may merge with an Affiliate of Holdings or the Company, as the

case may be, solely for the purpose of reincorporating Holdings or the Company in the United States, any
state thereof, the District of Columbia or any territory thereof so long as the amount of Indebtedness of
Holdings and its Restricted Subsidiaries is not increased thereby.

_Subsidiary Guarantors. Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture governing release of a_

Guarantee upon the sale, disposition or transfer of a Subsidiary Guarantor (other than any Intermediate Parent), no
Subsidiary Guarantor will, and Holdings will not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor, consolidate or merge with or into
or wind up into (whether or not such Subsidiary Guarantor is the surviving corporation), or sell, assign, transfer, lease,
convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets, in one or more related transactions, to
any Person unless:

(a) such Guarantor is the surviving entity or the Person formed by or surviving any

such consolidation or merger (if other than such Guarantor) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease,
conveyance or other disposition will have been made is a corporation, partnership, trust or limited liability
company organized or existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of such Guarantor, as the
case may be, or the laws of the United States, any state thereof, the District of Columbia or any territory
thereof (such Guarantor or such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the “Successor Person”);

to a supplemental indenture or other documents or instruments;

(c) immediately after such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists; or

(d) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an

Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental
indenture, if any, complies with the Indenture;

the covenant described under “Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales”, if applicable; or

(3) in the case of assets comprised of Equity Interests of Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors,

such Equity Interests are sold, assigned, transferred, leased, conveyed or otherwise disposed of to one or
more Restricted Subsidiaries.

Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture, the Successor Person will succeed to, and be

substituted for, such Guarantor under the Indenture and such Guarantor’s Guarantee. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
any Subsidiary Guarantor may (1) merge or consolidate with or into, wind up into or transfer all or part of its properties
and assets to another Guarantor or the Company, (2) merge with an Affiliate of Holdings or the Company solely for
the purpose of reincorporating the Subsidiary Guarantor in the United States, any state thereof, the District of

(4) liquidate or dissolve or change its legal form if Holdings determines in good faith that such action is in the best
interests of Holdings, in each case, without regard to the requirements set forth in the preceding paragraph.

**_Transactions with Affiliates_**

Holdings will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment to, or sell,

lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or
enter into or make or amend, any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or
for the benefit of any Affiliate of Holdings (each of the foregoing, an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate
payments or consideration in excess of $25.0 million, unless:

such Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are not materially less favorable to Holdings or

its relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by
Holdings or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person on an arm’s-length basis; and

(2) the Company delivers to the Trustee, with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of

related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of $50.0 million, a

obligations under the terms of, any stockholders agreement (including any registration rights agreement or

which it may enter into thereafter; provided, however, that the existence of, or the performance by Holdings
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of obligations under any future amendment to any such existing
agreement or under any similar agreement entered into after the Issue Date shall only be permitted by this
clause (6) to the extent that the terms of any such amendment or new agreement are not otherwise
disadvantageous in any material respect in the good faith judgment of the board of directors or management
of Holdings to the Holders when taken as a whole;

(7) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers, or purchasers or sellers of goods or services,

in each case in the ordinary course of business and otherwise in compliance with the terms of the Indenture

taken as a whole as compared to the Advisory Agreement in effect on the Issue Date).

Holdings will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (other than the Company) that are

not Guarantors to, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any consensual

**_Reports and Other Information_**

Whether or not required by the rules and regulations of the SEC, so long as any Notes are outstanding,

Holdings will furnish to the holders of notes, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and regulations:

all quarterly and annual reports that would be required to be filed with the SEC on Forms

10-Q and 10-K if Holdings were required to file such reports; and

(2) all current reports that would be required to be filed with the SEC on Form 8-K if Holdings

were required to file such reports.

88


-----

applicable to such reports. Each annual report on Form 10-K will include a report on Holdings’ consolidated financial
statements by Holdings’ independent registered public accounting firm.

In addition, Holdings and the Company agree that, for so long as any Notes remain outstanding, if at any

time they are not required to file with the SEC the reports required by the preceding paragraphs, they will furnish to
the holders of Notes and prospective investors, upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant
to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

Each report or document required to be furnished or delivered pursuant to the Indenture shall be deemed to

have been so furnished or delivered on the date on which Holdings posts such document on its current website, or
when such document is posted on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.

The Trustee will have no responsibility to determine whether the posting of such financial statements and

reports has occurred; delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes
only and the Trustee’s receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or
determinable from information contained therein, including Holdings’ or the Company’s, as applicable, compliance
with any of its covenants under the Indenture (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely on officer’s certificates).

**Events of Default and Remedies**

The Indenture will provide that each of the following is an Event of Default:

default in payment when due and payable (whether at maturity, upon redemption,

acceleration or otherwise) of principal of, or premium, if any, on the Notes;

(2) default for 30 days or more in the payment when due of interest on or with respect to the

Notes;

(3) failure by Holdings, the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor for 60 days after receipt of

written notice given by the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% of the aggregate principal amount of
the then outstanding Notes (with a copy to the Trustee) to comply with any of its other obligations, covenants
or agreements (other than a default referred to in clauses (1) and (2) above) contained in the Indenture or the
Notes;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by

which there is secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by Holdings or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries or the payment of which is guaranteed by Holdings or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or a Guarantor if both:

(a) such default either results from the failure to pay any principal of such

Indebtedness at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or relates
to an obligation other than the obligation to pay principal of any such Indebtedness at its stated final
maturity and results in the holder or holders of such Indebtedness causing such Indebtedness to
become due prior to its stated maturity; and

(b) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of

any other such Indebtedness in default for failure to pay principal at stated final maturity (after
giving effect to any applicable grace periods), or the maturity of which has been so accelerated,
aggregate $75.0 million or more at any one time outstanding;

(5) failure by Holdings, the Company or any Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments

aggregating in excess of $75.0 million, which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for
a period of more than 60 days after such judgment becomes final and non-appealable, and in the event such
judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon
such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to Holdings, the Company or any

Significant Subsidiary; or

89


-----

full force and effect or be declared null and void or any responsible officer of Holdings or any Subsidiary
Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary, as the case may be, denies in writing that it has any further liability
under its Guarantee or gives notice to such effect, other than by reason of the termination of the Indenture or
the release of any such Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture.

Except in the case of a default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any Note that

is to be paid by the Trustee, as paying agent, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the
occurrence of any default or event of default, unless a responsible trust officer of the Trustee shall have received
written notice from the Company or a holder describing such default or event of default and stating that such notice is
a notice of default.

If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (6) above) occurs and is continuing under the

Indenture, the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% of the aggregate principal amount of all then outstanding
Notes may declare the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then
outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately.

Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, such principal of and premium, if any, and interest will be due

and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause (6)
of the first paragraph of this section, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable without further action or
notice on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. The Indenture will provide that the Trustee may withhold from the
Holders notice of any continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or
interest, if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest. In addition, the Trustee will have no obligation to
accelerate the Notes.

The Indenture will provide that the Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of all then

outstanding Notes, by notice to the Trustee, may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default
and its consequences under the Indenture except a continuing Default in the payment of interest on, premium, if any,
or the principal of any Note held by a non-consenting Holder and rescind any acceleration with respect to the Notes
and its consequences (provided such rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction).

In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (4) above, such Event of Default and all consequences

thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Notes) shall be annulled,
waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders, if within 30 days after such
Event of Default arose:

the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been

discharged;

(2) holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may

be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or

(3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured.

The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the

request or direction of any of the Holders of the Notes unless the Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or
security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment
of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no Holder of a Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the
Indenture or the Notes unless:

such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) holders of at least 25% in the aggregate principal amount of all then outstanding Notes

have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) Holders of the Notes have offered the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the

Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;

90


-----

the offer of security or indemnity; and

(5) holders of a majority in principal amount of all then outstanding Notes have not given the

Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions contained in the Indenture, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the

total outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any
remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however,
may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that is unduly prejudicial to the rights of
any other Holder of a Note or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability.

The Indenture will provide that Holdings or the Company is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a

statement regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Company is required, within 30 days of becoming aware
of any continuing Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No present, past or future director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Company or any

Guarantor or any of their direct or indirect parent companies shall have any liability for any obligations of the
Company or the Guarantors under the Notes, the Guarantees, the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of,
or by reason of such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting the Notes waives and releases all such
liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be
effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such waiver is against
public policy.

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The Obligations of the Company and the Guarantors with respect to the Notes under the Indenture, the Notes

or the Guarantees, as the case may be, will terminate (other than certain obligations) and will be released upon payment
in full of all of the Notes. The Company may, at its option and at any time, elect to have all of its Obligations discharged
with respect to the Notes and have each Guarantor’s obligation discharged with respect to its Guarantee (“Legal
Defeasance”) and cure all then existing Events of Default except for:

the rights of Holders of Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, premium,

if any, and interest on the Notes when such payments are due solely out of the trust created pursuant to the
Indenture;

(2) the Company’s Obligations with respect to Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes,

registration of such Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or
agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights and immunities of the Trustee, and the Company’s obligations in connection

therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, the Company may, at its option and at any time, elect to have its obligations and those of each

Guarantor released with respect to substantially all the restrictive covenants that are described in the Indenture
(“Covenant Defeasance”) and thereafter any omission to comply with such obligations shall not constitute a Default
with respect to the Notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including bankruptcy,
receivership, rehabilitation and insolvency events pertaining to Holdings and the Company) described under “Events
of Default and Remedies” will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Notes.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance with respect to the Notes:

the Company must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the

Holders of the Notes, cash in U.S. Dollars, Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in such amounts
as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, to pay
the principal of, premium, if any, and interest due on the Notes on the stated maturity date or on the

91


-----

Company must specify whether such Notes are being defeased to maturity or to a particular redemption date;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an

Opinion of Counsel confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions,

(a) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the United States

Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or

(b) since the issuance of the Notes, there has been a change in the applicable U.S.

federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel
shall confirm that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, the Holders and the beneficial
owners of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
as applicable, as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on
the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such
Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an

Opinion of Counsel confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, the Holders and
beneficial owners of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes
as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to such tax on the same amounts, in the same
manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(4) no Default (other than that resulting from borrowing funds to be applied to make the deposit

required to effect such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance and any similar and simultaneous deposit
relating to other Indebtedness and, in each case, the granting of Liens in connection therewith) shall have
occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit;

(5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of,

or constitute a default under, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or any other material agreement or
instrument (other than the Indenture) to which the Company or any Guarantor is a party or by which the
Company or any Guarantor is bound (other than that resulting with respect to any Indebtedness being
defeased from any borrowing of funds to be applied to make the deposit required to effect such Legal
Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance and any similar and simultaneous deposit relating to such Indebtedness,
and the granting of Liens in connection therewith);

(6) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the

deposit was not made by the Company with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any
creditors of the Company or any Guarantor or others; and

(7) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of

Counsel (which Opinion of Counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions) each stating
that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance,
as the case may be, have been complied with.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Opinion of Counsel required by clause (2) above with respect to a Legal

Defeasance need not be delivered if all Notes not therefore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (x) have become
due and payable, or (y) will become due and payable on the maturity date within one year under arrangements
satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in our name, and at our expense.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes, when:

either

(a) all Notes theretofore authenticated and delivered, except lost, stolen or destroyed

Notes which have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has theretofore been
deposited in trust, have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

92


-----

due and payable by reason of the making of a notice of redemption or otherwise, will become due
and payable within one year or are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements
satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at
the expense, of the Company and the Company or any Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or
caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the Holders
of the Notes, cash in U.S. Dollars, Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in such amounts
as will be sufficient without consideration of any reinvestment of interest to pay and discharge the
entire indebtedness on the Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation for
principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest to the date of maturity or redemption;

(2) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it under the Indenture; and

(3) the Company has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the deposited

money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be.

The Trustee will acknowledge the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture if we have delivered to the

Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction
and discharge have been complied with.

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

Except as provided below, the Indenture, any Guarantee and the Notes may be amended or supplemented

with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding,
including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes and any
existing Default or compliance with any provision of the Indenture or the Notes issued thereunder may be waived with
the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, other than Notes
beneficially owned by the Company or its Affiliates (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of or
tender offer or exchange offer for the Notes); provided that (x) if any such amendment or waiver will only affect one
series of Notes (or less than all series of Notes) then outstanding under the Indenture, then only the consent of the
Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes of such series then outstanding (including, in each case,
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) shall be required and
(y) if any such amendment or waiver by its terms will affect a series of Notes in a manner different and materially
adverse relative to the manner such amendment or waiver affects other series of Notes, then the consent of the Holders
of a majority in principal amount of the Notes of such series then outstanding (including, in each case, consents
obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) shall be required.

The Indenture will provide that, without the consent of each affected Holder of Notes, an amendment or

waiver may not, with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

reduce the principal amount of such Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment,

supplement or waiver;

(2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed final maturity of any such Note or change the

date on which any Notes may be subject to redemption or reduce the redemption price therefor:

(3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any Note;

(4) (A) waive a Default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the

Notes, except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of all then outstanding Notes, and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such
acceleration, or (B) waive a Default in respect of a covenant or provision contained in the Indenture or any
Subsidiary Guarantee which cannot be amended or modified without the consent of all Holders;

(5) make any Note payable in money other than U.S. Dollars;

(6) make any change in these amendment and waiver provisions;

93


-----

interest on such Holder’s Notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of
any payment on or with respect to such Holder’s Notes or the Subsidiary Guarantees;

(8) make any change to or modify the ranking of the Notes that would adversely affect the

Holders; or

(9) except as expressly permitted by the Indenture, modify the Guarantee of Holdings in any

manner materially adverse to the Holders of such Notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company, any Guarantor (with respect to a Guarantee or the Indenture

to which it is a party) and the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture and any Guarantee or Notes without
the consent of any Holder:

to cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes or to alter

the provisions of the Indenture relating to the form of the Notes (including the related definitions) in a manner
that does not materially adversely affect any Holder (as determined by Holdings) (provided that, in each case,
the resulting Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended);

(3) to comply with the covenant relating to mergers, consolidations and sales of assets;

(4) to provide for the assumption of the Company’s or any Guarantor’s obligations to the

Holders;

(5) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders or

that does not adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any such Holder (as determined by
Holdings);

(6) to add covenants for the benefit of the Holders or to surrender any right or power conferred

upon the Company or any Guarantor;

(7) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture of a

successor Trustee thereunder pursuant to the requirements thereof;

(8) to provide for the issuance of exchange notes or private exchange notes, which are identical

to exchange notes except that they are not freely transferable;

(9) to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the Indenture;

(10) to add a Guarantor under the Indenture and to allow a Guarantor to execute a supplemental

indenture and/or guarantee the Notes or to release a Guarantor in accordance with the terms of the Indenture;

(11) to conform the text of the Indenture, Guarantees or the Notes to any provisions of this

“Description of Notes” (as determined by Holdings);

(12) to make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and

legending of Notes as permitted by the Indenture, including, without limitation to facilitate the issuance and
administration of the Notes; provided, however, that (i) compliance with the Indenture as so amended would
not result in Notes being transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable securities law and
(ii) such amendment does not materially and adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer Notes (in each
case, as determined by Holdings); or

(13) to provide for the issuance of the Notes in a manner consistent with the terms of the

Indenture.

-----

proposed amendment or waiver. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment or
waiver.

For purposes of determining whether the Holders of the requisite principal amount of Notes have taken any

action under the Indenture, the principal amount of Notes shall be deemed to be the U.S. Dollar equivalent of such
principal amount of Notes as of (i) if a record date has been set with respect to the taking of such action, such date or
(ii) if no such record date has been set, the date the taking of such action by the Holders of such requisite principal
amount is certified to the Trustee by the Company.

The Trustee may execute any amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture if the Company shall deliver

to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each stating that all conditions precedent to the
amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture have been complied with and that the amendment, supplement or
waiver of the Indenture is authorized or permitted by the terms of the Indenture.

**Notices**

Notices given by publication or electronic delivery will be deemed given on the first date on which

publication or electronic delivery is made and notices given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, will be deemed given
five calendar days after mailing or transmitting.

**Concerning the Trustee**

Computershare Trust Company, N.A., shall be appointed as the Trustee under the Indenture and will be

appointed by the Company as registrar and a paying agent Notes under the Indenture. The Trustee, in any capacity,
has not participated in the preparation of this Offering Circular and makes no representation or warranty as to the
accuracy or validity of the information contained herein.

The Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee will

perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in the Indenture. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or
refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty. The Trustee
will not be required to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur financial liability in acting under the Indenture
or security documents if there are reasonable grounds for believing that the repayment of those funds or indemnity
satisfactory to it against that risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it under the Indenture or security documents,
as applicable.

The Indenture will contain certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee thereunder, should it become a

creditor of the Company, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in
respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions;
however, if it acquires any conflicting interest, it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days or resign.

The Indenture will provide that the Holders of a majority in principal amount of all then outstanding Notes

will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy
available to the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture will provide that in case an Event of Default shall
occur (which shall not be cured), the Trustee (and no other agent) will be required, in the exercise of the rights and
powers vested in it by the Indenture, to use the degree of care of a prudent person in the conduct of his own affairs.
The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of
any Holder of the Notes, unless such Holder shall have offered to the Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to
the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture, the Notes and any Guarantee will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws

of the State of New York, but without giving effect to applicable principles of conflicts of law to the extent that the
application of the law of another jurisdiction would be required thereby.

**Certain Definitions**

Set forth below are certain defined terms used in the Indenture. For purposes of the Indenture, unless

otherwise specifically indicated, the term “consolidated” with respect to any Person refers to such Person consolidated

95


-----

Unrestricted Subsidiary were not an Affiliate of such Person.

“Acquired Indebtedness” means, with respect to any specified Person,

Indebtedness of any other Person existing at the time such other Person is merged with or

into or became a Restricted Subsidiary of such specified Person, including Indebtedness incurred in
connection with, or in contemplation of, such other Person merging with or into or becoming a Restricted

Subsidiaries since the beginning of such period shall have made any Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger,

had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to such
Indebtedness). Interest on a Capitalized Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably
determined by a responsible financial or accounting officer of Holdings to be the rate of interest implicit in such
Capitalized Lease Obligation in accordance with GAAP. For purposes of making the computation referred to above,
interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility computed on a pro forma basis shall be computed based
upon the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the applicable period except as set forth in the first
paragraph of this definition. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon

The Notes are being offered and sold to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in

reliance on Rule 144A (“Rule 144A Notes”). The Notes also may be offered and sold in offshore transactions in
reliance on Regulation S (“Regulation S Notes”). Except as set forth below, the Notes will initially be issued in
registered, global form in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. Notes
will be issued at the closing of this offering only against payment in immediately available funds.

Rule 144A Notes initially will be represented by one or more notes in registered, global form without interest

coupons (collectively, the “Rule 144A Global Notes”). Regulation S Notes initially will be represented by one or more
temporary notes in registered, global form without interest coupons (collectively, the “Regulation S Temporary Global
Notes”). The Rule 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes will be deposited upon issuance
with the Trustee as custodian for The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), and registered in the name of DTC or its
nominee, in each case, for credit to an account of a direct or indirect participant in DTC as described below. Through
and including the 40th day after the later of the commencement of this offering and the closing of this offering (such
period through and including such 40th day, the “Restricted Period”), beneficial interests in the Regulation S
Temporary Global Notes may be held only through Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. as the operator of the Euroclear System
(“Euroclear”), and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme (“Clearstream”) (as indirect participants in DTC), unless
transferred to a person that takes delivery through a Rule 144A Global Note in accordance with the certification
requirements described below. Within a reasonable time period after the expiration of the Restricted Period, the
Regulation S Temporary Global Notes will be exchanged for one or more permanent notes in registered, global form
without interest coupons (collectively, the “Regulation S Permanent Global Notes” and, together with the Regulation
S Temporary Global Notes, the “Regulation S Global Notes;” the Regulation S Global Notes and the Rule 144A
Global Notes collectively being the “Global Notes”) upon delivery to DTC of certification of compliance with the
transfer restrictions applicable to the notes and pursuant to Regulation S as provided in the Indenture. Beneficial
interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes may not be exchanged for beneficial interests in the Regulation S Global
Notes or vice versa at any time except in the limited circumstances described below. See “—Exchanges Between
Regulation S Notes and Rule 144A Notes.”

Except as set forth below, the Global Notes may be transferred, in whole and not in part, only to another

nominee of DTC or to a successor of DTC or its nominee. Beneficial interests in the Global Notes may not be
exchanged for definitive notes in registered certificated form (“Certificated Notes”) except in the limited
circumstances described below. See “—Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes.” Except in the limited
circumstances described below, owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will not be entitled to receive
physical delivery of notes in certificated form.

Rule 144A Notes (including beneficial interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes) will be subject to certain

restrictions on transfer and will bear a restrictive legend as described under “Notice to Investors.” Regulation S Notes
will also bear the legend as described under “Notice to Investors.” In addition, transfers of beneficial interests in the
Global Notes will be subject to the applicable rules and procedures of DTC and its direct or indirect participants
(including, if applicable, those of Euroclear and Clearstream), which may change from time to time.

**Depository Procedures**

The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream are provided

solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective
settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. The Company takes no responsibility for these operations and
procedures and urges investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters.

DTC has advised the Company that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company created to hold securities for its

participating organizations (collectively, the “Participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of
transactions in those securities between the Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its
Participants. The Participants include securities brokers and dealers (including the initial purchasers), banks, trust
companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s system is also available to other
entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with
a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the “Indirect Participants”). Persons who are not Participants
may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the Participants or the Indirect Participants.
The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are
recorded on the records of the Participants and Indirect Participants.

120


-----

(1) upon deposit of the Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of the Participants designated by the

initial purchasers with portions of the principal amount of the Global Notes; and

(2) ownership of these interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership of

these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the Participants) or
by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in the
Global Notes).

Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes that are Participants may hold their interests therein directly through

DTC. Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes that are not Participants may hold their interests therein indirectly
through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream) which are Participants. Investors in the Regulation S
Global Notes must initially hold their interests therein through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in
such systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants. After the expiration of the Restricted Period
(but not earlier), investors may also hold interests in the Regulation S Global Notes through Participants in the DTC
system other than Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Regulation S Global
Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of
their respective depositaries, which are Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of Euroclear, and Citibank, N.A., as
operator of Clearstream. All interests in a Global Note, including those held through Euroclear or Clearstream, may
be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Those interests held through Euroclear or Clearstream may
also be subject to the procedures and requirements of such systems. The laws of some jurisdictions may require that
certain Persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own. Consequently, the ability to
transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to such Persons will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only
on behalf of the Participants, which in turn act on behalf of the Indirect Participants, the ability of a Person having
beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge such interests to Persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or
otherwise take actions in respect of such interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing
such interests.

Except as described below, beneficial owners of interests in the Global Notes will not have notes registered

in their names, will not receive physical delivery of Certificated Notes and will not be considered the registered owners
or “holders” thereof under the Indenture for any purpose.

Payments in respect of the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest, on, a Global Note registered in the

name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered holder under the Indenture. Under
the terms of the Indenture, the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee will treat the Persons in whose names the
notes, including the Global Notes, are registered as the owners of the notes for the purpose of receiving payments and
for all other purposes. Consequently, neither the Company, the Guarantors, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company,
the Guarantors or the Trustee has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

(1) any aspect of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to or

payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating
to the beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes; or

(2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or Indirect

Participants.

DTC has advised the Company that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities

such as the notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the
payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe that it will not receive payment on such payment date.
Each relevant Participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the
principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the Participants and the
Indirect Participants to the beneficial owners of notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary
practices and will be the responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants and will not be the responsibility
of DTC, the Trustee, the Company or the Guarantors. None of the Company, the Guarantors nor the trustee will be
liable for any delay by DTC or any of the Participants or the Indirect Participants in identifying the beneficial owners
of the notes, and the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee may conclusively rely on and will be protected in
relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes.

121


-----

will be effected in accordance with DTC’s procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds, and transfers between
participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and operating
procedures.

Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the notes described herein, cross-market

transfers between the Participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will
be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be,
by their respective depositaries; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to
Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and
procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case
may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective depositary to
take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant Global Note in
DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement
applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the
depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream.

DTC has advised the Company that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes only at

the direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only
in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the notes as to which such Participant or Participants
has or have given such direction. However, if there is an Event of Default under the notes, DTC reserves the right to
exchange the Global Notes for legended Certificated Notes, and to distribute such notes to its Participants.

Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing procedures to facilitate transfers of

interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Global Notes among participants in DTC, Euroclear
and Clearstream, they are under no obligation to perform or to continue to perform such procedures, and may
discontinue such procedures at any time. None of the Company, the Guarantors nor the Trustee nor any of their
respective agents will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their
respective participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing
their operations.

**Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes**

A Global Note is exchangeable for Certificated Notes if:

(1) DTC (a) notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the Global

Notes or (b) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and, in either case, the
Company fails to appoint a successor depositary;

(2) the Company, at its option, notifies the Trustee in writing that it elects to cause the issuance of the

Certificated Notes; provided that in no event shall the Regulation S Temporary Global Note be exchanged
for Certificated Notes prior to (a) the expiration of the Restricted Period and (b) the receipt of any certificates
required under the provisions of Regulation S; or

(3) there has occurred and is continuing an Event of Default with respect to the Notes and DTC notifies

the Trustee of its decision to exchange the Global Notes for Certificated Notes.

In addition, beneficial interests in a Global Note may be exchanged for Certificated Notes upon prior written

notice given to the Trustee by or on behalf of DTC in accordance with the Indenture. In all cases, Certificated Notes
delivered in exchange for any Global Note or beneficial interests in Global Notes will be registered in the names, and
issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of the depositary (in accordance with its customary
procedures) and will bear the applicable restrictive legend referred to in “Notice to Investors,” unless that legend is
not required by applicable law.

**Exchange of Certificated Notes for Global Notes**

Certificated Notes may not be exchanged for beneficial interests in any Global Note unless the transferor first

delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will
comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

122


-----

Prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period, beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note may be

exchanged for beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note only if:

(1) such exchange occurs in connection with a transfer of the notes pursuant to Rule 144A; and

(2) the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture)

to the effect that the notes are being transferred to a Person:

(a) that the transferor reasonably believes to be a qualified institutional buyer within the meaning

of Rule 144A;

(b) purchasing for its own account or the account of a qualified institutional buyer in a transaction

meeting the requirements of Rule 144A; and

(c) in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the United States and other

jurisdictions.

Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the

form of an interest in the Regulation S Global Note, whether before or after the expiration of the Restricted Period,
only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the
effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Rule 903 or 904 of Regulation S or Rule 144 (if available)
and that, if such transfer occurs prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period, the interest transferred will be held
immediately thereafter through Euroclear or Clearstream.

Transfers involving exchanges of beneficial interests between a Regulation S Global Note and a Rule 144A

Global Note will be effected by DTC by means of an instruction through the DTC Deposit/Withdraw at Custodian
system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease
in the principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the
Rule 144A Global Note or vice versa, as applicable. Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Notes that is
transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in another Global Note will, upon transfer, cease
to be an interest in such Global Note and will become an interest in the other Global Note and, accordingly, will
thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in such other
Global Note for so long as it remains such an interest. The policies and practices of DTC may prohibit transfers of
beneficial interests in the Regulation S Global Notes prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period.

**Certifications by Holders of the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes**

A holder of a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes must provide Euroclear or

Clearstream, as the case may be, with a certificate in the form required by the Indenture certifying that the beneficial
owner of the interest in the Regulation S Temporary Global Note is either a non-U.S. person or a U.S. person that has
purchased such interest in a transaction that is exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities Act, and
Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, must provide to the Trustee (or the paying agent if other than the Trustee)
a certificate in the form required by the Indenture, prior to any exchange of such beneficial interest for a beneficial
interest in the Regulation S Permanent Global Notes.

**Same Day Settlement and Payment**

The Company will make payments in respect of the notes represented by the Global Notes (including

principal, premium, if any, and interest) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by
DTC or its nominee. The Company will make all payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest, with respect to
Certificated Notes in the manner described above. The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to trade in
DTC’s Same-Day Funds Settlement System, and any permitted secondary market trading activity in such notes will,
therefore, be required by DTC to be settled in immediately available funds. The Company expects that secondary
trading in any Certificated Notes will also be settled in immediately available funds.

Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant purchasing

an interest in a Global Note from a Participant will be credited, and any such crediting will be reported to the relevant
Euroclear or Clearstream participant, during the securities settlement processing day (which must be a business day

123


-----

that cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of sales of interests in a Global Note by or through a Euroclear
or Clearstream participant to a Participant will be received with value on the settlement date of DTC but will be
available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the business day for Euroclear or
Clearstream following DTC’s settlement date.

The following is a discussion of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. holders and

non-U.S. holders (each as defined below) relating to the purchase, ownership, and disposition of the Notes. This
discussion is based upon current provisions of Code, Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, rulings,
pronouncements, judicial decisions, and administrative interpretations of the IRS, in each case as in effect and publicly
available on the date hereof, all of which are subject to change and differing interpretation, possibly on a retroactive
basis, at any time by legislative, judicial, or administrative action. We cannot assure you that the IRS will not challenge
the conclusions stated below or that a court will not find in the IRS’s favor. No ruling from the IRS has been (or will
be) sought on any of the matters discussed herein. The discussion set forth below is limited to holders who are the
initial purchasers of the Notes for cash at their “issue price” (i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount of the
Notes is sold to the public for cash, other than to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the
capacity of underwriters, placement agents, or wholesalers) and hold the Notes as capital assets within the meaning of
Section 1221 of the Code.

The following discussion does not purport to be a complete analysis of all the potential U.S. federal income

tax effects relating to the purchase, ownership, and disposition of the Notes. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, this discussion does not address the effect of any rules applicable to holders that are subject to special
treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including, without limitation: traders and dealers in securities or
currencies; insurance companies; financial institutions, banks, and thrifts; regulated investment companies, real estate
investment trusts, controlled foreign corporations, and passive foreign investment companies; holders of the Existing
Notes whose interests in the Existing Notes are redeemed in the Redemption; U.S. persons whose functional currency
is not the U.S. Dollar; U.S. expatriates; persons who hold Notes as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion transaction,
or other risk reduction or integrated investment transaction; holders of securities that elect to use a mark-to-market
method of accounting for their securities holdings; individual retirement accounts, qualified pension plans, other
retirement plans, and tax-deferred accounts; and pass-through entities, including partnerships and Subchapter S
corporations, and beneficial owners of interests in such pass-through entities. Finally, this discussion does not address
the effect of alternative minimum tax or the Medicare tax on net investment income, special tax accounting rules as a
result of any item of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an applicable financial
statement, any U.S. state or local tax laws, tax treaties or U.S. federal tax laws (other than U.S. federal income tax
laws), or foreign tax laws.

**Certain Contingent Payments**

In certain circumstances, we have the option or may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of the stated

interest or principal on the Notes. See “Description of Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of
Control.” The obligation to make such payments may implicate the provisions of Treasury regulations relating to
“contingent payment debt instruments.” According to applicable Treasury regulations, the possibility of any such
payments will not cause the Notes to be treated as contingent payment debt instruments, if, as of the date the Notes are
issued, such contingencies are considered “remote” or “incidental” (for instance, where there is a remote likelihood
that the payment will be required or the potential amount of the payment is insignificant relative to the remaining
payments on the debt instrument). In addition, under the applicable Treasury regulations, it is presumed that an issuer
of a debt instrument will not exercise an option to pay amounts in excess of the stated interest or principal on such debt
instrument if such payments would increase the yield on the debt instrument. We intend to take the position that the
contingencies associated with the Notes should not cause the Notes to be subject to the contingent payment debt
instrument rules. Our determination is binding on a holder unless such holder discloses its contrary position in the
manner required by applicable Treasury regulations. Our determination is not, however, binding on the IRS, and if
the IRS were to successfully challenge this determination, a holder might be required to accrue interest income at a
higher rate than the stated interest rate on the Notes, and to treat as ordinary income any gain realized on the taxable
disposition of a Note. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes will not be treated as contingent
payment debt instruments.

125


-----

For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of a Note that is for U.S.

federal income tax purposes:

    - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

    - a corporation (or other entity taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a corporation) created or
organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia;

    - an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

    - a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration
of the trust and one or more United States persons (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the
Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if a valid election is in effect
under applicable Treasury regulations to treat the trust as a United States person.

**Taxation of Interest**

Stated interest payable on a Note generally will be taxable to a U.S. holder as ordinary interest income at the

time it is received or accrued, in accordance with such U.S. holder’s regular method of accounting for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

The Notes may be issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such event, U.S. holders generally

will be required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary interest income) for U.S. federal income tax purposes
under a constant yield accrual method regardless of their regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. As a result, U.S. holders will generally include any OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash
attributable to such income. The Notes will be treated as issued with OID if the stated principal amount of the Notes
exceeds their issue price by an amount equal to or more than a statutorily defined de minimis amount (generally, 0.0025
multiplied by the stated principal amount and the number of complete years to maturity from the issue date).

**Sale, Exchange, or Retirement of a Note**

A U.S. holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss on a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement, or

other taxable disposition of a Note, equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount of cash and the fair market
value of any property received (other than any cash or other property attributable to accrued and unpaid stated interest
on the Note, which will be taxable as ordinary income to the extent not previously so taxed), and (ii) the U.S. holder’s
adjusted tax basis in the Note. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note generally will equal the cost of the Note to
the U.S. holder, increased by any OID previously included in income.

Any such capital gain or loss will be treated as a long-term capital gain or loss if, at the time of the sale or

other taxable disposition, the Note has been held by the U.S. holder for more than one year; otherwise, the capital gain
or loss will be short-term. Non-corporate U.S. holders may be subject to a reduced U.S. federal income tax rate on
their net long-term capital gains. All U.S. holders are entitled to certain limitations on the deductibility of capital
losses.

**Non-U.S. Holders**

The following summary is limited to certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences relevant to a

beneficial owner of a Note that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes an individual, corporation, trust or estate and
is not a U.S. holder (a “non-U.S. holder”).

**Taxation of Interest and OID**

Subject to the summaries regarding backup withholding and FATCA below, payments of interest (including,

for purposes of this section, “—Non-U.S. Holders,” and OID, if any) on a Note to any non-U.S. holder generally will
not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax provided the interest is not effectively connected with such
non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a U.S. trade or business, the non-U.S. holder provides to us or the person otherwise

126


-----

non-U.S. holder’s foreign status, and such non-U.S. holder is not:

    - an actual or constructive owner of 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all of the voting
stock of the Company; or

    - a controlled foreign corporation related, actually or constructively, to the Company through stock
ownership.

In order to satisfy the certification requirement, the non-U.S. holder must generally provide a properly

completed IRS Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E (or appropriate substitute or successor form) to us or the applicable
withholding agent. When a security clearing organization, bank, financial institution, or other agent holds the Notes
in the ordinary course of its trade or business on behalf of the non-U.S. holder, the non-U.S. holder may be required
to provide appropriate documentation to such agent. Special rules apply to foreign partnerships, estates and trusts and,
in certain circumstances, certifications as to foreign status of partners, trust owners or beneficiaries may have to be
provided to the applicable withholding agent or to us. In addition, special rules apply to payments made through a
qualified intermediary.

If a non-U.S. holder does not qualify for an exemption from U.S. taxation in accordance with the rules

described above, interest income will be subject to withholding tax at the rate of 30% at the time the interest is paid,
unless the non-U.S. holder provides us or the applicable withholding agent, as applicable, with a properly executed
IRS Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E (or successor form) claiming an exemption from or reduction in withholding
due to the benefit of an applicable U.S. income tax treaty, or IRS Form W-8ECI (or successor form) stating that interest
paid on the Note is not subject to withholding tax because it is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder’s conduct
of a U.S. trade or business. If a non-U.S. holder is engaged in a trade or business in the United States and interest on
a Note is effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business or, if a U.S. income tax treaty applies, the
non-U.S. holder maintains a “permanent establishment” in the United States to which the income is attributable, the
non-U.S. holder will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at the rates generally applicable to
U.S. holders.

If a non-U.S. holder is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and the Notes are effectively

connected with its conduct of a U.S. trade or business, such corporation may be subject to a 30% branch profits tax (or
such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty) with respect to profits resulting from such interest.

**Sale, Exchange, or Retirement of a Note**

Subject to the summaries regarding backup withholding and FATCA below, any gain realized by a non-U.S.

holder on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement, or other taxable disposition of a Note generally will not be subject
to U.S. federal income tax, unless:

    - such gain is effectively connected with the conduct by such non-U.S. holder of a trade or business within
the United States (and, if an applicable income tax treaty so provides, is attributable to a United States
“permanent establishment”), in which case such gain will generally be taxable in the same manner as
that applicable to a U.S. holder, as described above; or

    - the non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the
taxable year of the disposition and certain other conditions are satisfied, in which case, such gain (net of
certain U.S. source capital losses, provided the non-U.S. holder timely files U.S. federal income tax
returns with respect to such losses) will be subject to tax at a 30% rate (or lower applicable treaty rate).

Proceeds from the disposition of a Note that are attributable to accrued but unpaid interest generally will be

subject to, or exempt from, tax to the same extent as described above with respect to interest paid on a Note.

If a non-U.S. holder is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and the gain realized from the sale

or other taxable disposition of a Note is effectively connected with such non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a U.S. trade or
business, such corporation may be subject to a 30% branch profits tax (or such lower rate specified by an applicable
income tax treaty) with respect to profits resulting from such gain.

127


-----

Section 1471 to 1474 of the Code (such Sections commonly referred to as FATCA) generally imposes a U.S.

federal withholding tax of 30% on payments of interest (including any OID) and, subject to the proposed Treasury
regulations discussed below, payments of gross proceeds from the disposition of a Note to a “foreign financial
institution” (as defined in the Code) (an “FFI”) unless the FFI (1) enters into an agreement with the IRS (or is subject
to an applicable intergovernmental agreement) to withhold on certain payments and to collect and provide to the IRS
(or local revenue authorities, as required under an applicable intergovernmental agreement) information regarding
United States persons who hold accounts with the FFI and its affiliates (including certain foreign entities owned by
United States persons), and (2) provides the payor with a properly completed IRS Form W-8BEN-E to document its
status or the FFI otherwise qualifies for an exemption. This IRS Form W-8BEN-E must include the FFI’s Global
Intermediary Identification Number, which is obtained by registering with the IRS. FATCA may also impose a 30%
withholding tax on payments of interest (including any OID) and, subject to the proposed Treasury regulations
discussed below, payments of gross proceeds from the disposition of a Note to a “non-financial foreign entity” (as
defined in the Code) unless the entity provides the withholding agent with a properly completed IRS Form W-8BENE certifying that it does not have any “substantial United States owners” (as defined in the Code) or identifying its
direct and indirect substantial United States owners or the entity otherwise qualifies for an exemption.

While withholding under FATCA would have applied also to payments of gross proceeds from the sale or

other disposition of a Note, proposed Treasury regulations eliminate FATCA withholding on payments of gross
proceeds entirely. Taxpayers generally may rely on these proposed Treasury Regulations until final Treasury
regulations are issued.

Holders should consult with their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of FATCA with respect to

an investment in the Notes.

**Backup Withholding and Information Reporting**

_U.S. Holders. Payments of interest and OID, if any, on, or the proceeds of the sale or other taxable disposition_

of, a Note are generally subject to information reporting unless the U.S. holder is an exempt recipient (such as a
corporation). Such payments may also be subject to backup withholding at the applicable rate if the U.S. holder fails
to supply a correct taxpayer identification number, fails to certify that the IRS has not notified it that it is subject to
backup withholding, or otherwise fails to establish an exemption from backup withholding. Any amounts withheld
under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or credit against that U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income
tax liability, provided the U.S. holder properly and timely provides certain information to the IRS.

_Non-U.S. Holders. In general, a non-U.S. holder will not be subject to backup withholding with respect to_

payments of interest or OID, if any, on, and gross proceeds from the disposition of, the Notes, provided that the
applicable withholding agent does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that such a non-U.S. holder is a United
States person and such non-U.S. holder has provided the applicable withholding agent appropriate certification of the
non-U.S. holder’s non-U.S. status, as discussed above. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules
may be allowed as a refund or a credit against such non-U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability provided the
required information is properly and timely furnished to the IRS. The name and address of the non-U.S. holder, the
amount of interest paid on a Note, and the amount, if any, of tax withheld generally will be reported to the IRS. Copies
of the information returns reporting such payments may also be made available to the tax authorities of the country in
which the non-U.S. holder resides under the provisions of an applicable treaty or agreement.

**The preceding discussion of certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations is for general**

**information only. It is not tax advice. Each prospective investor should consult its tax advisor regarding the**
**particular U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences of purchasing, holding, and disposing of the**
**Notes, including the consequences of any proposed change in applicable laws.**

128


-----

This disclosure was written in connection with the promotion and marketing of the Notes and it cannot be

used by any holder for the purpose of avoiding penalties that may be asserted against the holder under the Code.
Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the application of the U.S.
federal income tax laws to their particular situations.

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase and holding of the Notes

by employee benefit plans that are subject to Title I of the United States Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), plans, individual retirement accounts and other arrangements that are subject to
Section 4975 of the Code, and entities whose underlying assets are considered to include “plan assets” of such
employee benefit plans, plans, accounts or arrangements (as defined by Section 3(42) of ERISA and 29 C.F.R. Section
2510.3-101) (each, an “ERISA Plan”). Employee benefit plans that are governmental plans (as defined in
Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and non-U.S. plans (as
described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) are not subject to the requirements of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code;
however, such plans may be subject to non-U.S., federal, state, or local laws or regulations that are substantially similar
to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (“Similar Laws”) or which otherwise affect their ability to invest in
the Notes. Any fiduciary of such a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan considering an investment in the Notes
(together with ERISA Plans, “Plans”) should determine the need for, and, if necessary, the availability of, any
exemptive relief under such laws or regulations.

**General Fiduciary Matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of an ERISA Plan and prohibit

certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA
and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an
ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice
for a fee or other compensation with respect to the assets of such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a
fiduciary of the ERISA Plan.

In considering an investment in the Notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a Plan fiduciary should

consult with its counsel in order to determine the suitability of the Notes for such Plan, including whether the
investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of
ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan and the need for, and the availability,
if necessary, of any exemptive relief under any such laws or regulations. In addition, a fiduciary of a Plan should
consult with its counsel in order to determine if the investment satisfies the fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including,
without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA,
the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws.

Each ERISA Plan should consider the fact that we and none of the initial purchasers or their respective

affiliates (collectively, the “Transaction Parties”) is acting, or will act, as a fiduciary to any ERISA Plan with respect
to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. The Transaction Parties are not undertaking to provide impartial
investment advice or advice based on any particular investment need, or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, with
respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. All communications, correspondence and materials from the
Transaction Parties with respect to the Notes are intended to be general in nature and are not directed at any specific
purchaser of the Notes, and do not constitute advice regarding the advisability of investment in the Notes for any
specific purchaser. The decision to purchase and hold the Notes must be made solely by each prospective ERISA Plan
purchaser on an arm’s length basis.

**Prohibited Transaction Issues**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified

transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest”, within the meaning of ERISA,
or “disqualified persons”, within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless a statutory or administrative
exemption is applicable to the transaction. Such “prohibited transactions” include, without limitation, (1) a direct or
indirect extension of credit to a party in interest or to a disqualified person, (2) the sale or exchange of any property
between an ERISA Plan and a party in interest or a disqualified person, or (3) the transfer to, or use by or for the
benefit of, a party in interest or a disqualified person, of any plan assets.

A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject

129


-----

Plan that engages in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA
and the Code. The acquisition, holding and/or disposition of Notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which any
Transaction Party is considered a party in interest or disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect
prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired
and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this
regard, certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction rules could be applicable to the purchase and holding of
the Notes by an ERISA Plan, depending on the type and circumstances of the fiduciary making the decision to acquire
such Notes and the relationship of the party in interest or disqualified person to the ERISA Plan. Included among these
exemptions are Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code for certain transactions between
an ERISA Plan and non-fiduciary service providers to the ERISA Plan. In addition, the United States Department of
Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may apply to the acquisition and holding of
the Notes. These class exemptions (as may be amended from time to time) include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14
(respecting transactions effected by independent “qualified professional asset managers”), PTCE 90-1 (respecting
insurance company pooled separate accounts), PTCE 91-38 (respecting bank collective investment funds), PTCE
95-60 (respecting life insurance company general accounts) and PTCE 96-23 (respecting transactions directed by
in-house asset managers).

Each of these PTCEs contains conditions and limitations on its application. Thus, the fiduciaries of an ERISA

Plan that is considering acquiring and/or holding the Notes in reliance of any of these, or any other, PTCEs should
carefully review the conditions and limitations of the PTCE and consult with their counsel to confirm that it is
applicable. There can be no, and we do not provide any, assurance that any PTCE or any other exemption will be
available with respect to any particular transaction involving the notes.

Similar Laws governing the investment and management of the assets of governmental plans, certain church

plans and non-U.S. plans which are not subject to ERISA and the Code may contain fiduciary responsibility and
prohibited transaction requirements similar to those under Title I of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code.
Accordingly, fiduciaries of such Plans, in consultation with their counsel, should consider the impact of Similar Laws
on investments in the Notes and the considerations discussed above, to the extent applicable.

Because of the foregoing, the Notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing “plan assets”

of any Plan, unless such acquisition, holding and subsequent disposition (i) are entitled to exemption relief from the
prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and the Code and are otherwise permissible under all applicable Similar
Laws or (ii) will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA and the Code or similar violation of
any applicable Similar Laws.

The foregoing discussion is necessarily general in nature, is not intended to be all-inclusive, and should not

be construed as legal advice or a legal opinion. Further, no assurance can be given that future legislation, administrative
rulings, court decisions or regulatory action will not modify the conclusions set forth in this discussion. Any such
changes may be retroactive and thereby apply to transactions entered into prior to the date of their enactment or release.
Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt
prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries or other persons considering purchasing the Notes
(and holding the Notes) on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential
applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such transactions and whether an exemption
would be applicable.

**Representation**

Accordingly, by acceptance of a Note, each purchaser and subsequent transferee will be deemed to

have represented and agreed that either (i) no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or transferee to acquire and
hold the Notes or an interest therein constitutes assets of any Plan or (ii) (a) the acquisition, holding and disposition by
such purchaser or transferee of the Notes or an interest therein will not constitute or result in a prohibited transaction
under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or similar violation under any applicable Similar Laws, and
(b) none of the Transaction Parties has acted as the Plan’s fiduciary, or has been relied upon for any advice, with
respect to the Plan’s decision to acquire a Note and none of the Transaction Parties will at any time be relied upon as
the Plan’s fiduciary with respect to any decision to acquire, continue to hold or transfer a Note.

-----

The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within the United

States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act) except
to (a) “qualified institutional buyers” in reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities
Act provided by Rule 144A and (b) persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S.

Each purchaser of Notes will be deemed to have represented and agreed as follows (terms used in this

paragraph that are defined in Rule 144A or Regulation S under the Securities Act are used in this offering circular as
defined therein):

(1) The purchaser (A) (i) is a “qualified institutional buyer,” (ii) is aware that the sale

to it is being made in reliance on Rule 144A and (iii) is acquiring such Notes for its own account or
for the account of a qualified institutional buyer or (B) is not a U.S. Person and is purchasing such
Notes in an offshore transaction pursuant to Regulation S.

(2) The purchaser understands that the Notes are being offered in a transaction not

involving any public offering in the United States within the meaning of the Securities Act, that the
Notes have not been, and except as described in the offering circular, will not be registered under the
Securities Act and that (A) if in the future it decides to offer, resell, pledge or otherwise transfer any
of the Notes, such Notes may be offered, sold, pledged or otherwise transferred only (i) to APi Group
DE, Inc. or its subsidiaries, (ii) in the United States to a person whom the seller reasonably believes
is a “qualified institutional buyer” in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A, (iii)
outside the United States in a transaction complying with the provisions of Rule 904 under the
Securities Act, (iv) pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act provided by
Rule 144 (if applicable) or (v) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act,
in each of cases (i) through (v) in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any state of the
United States, and (B) the purchaser will, and each subsequent holder is required to, notify any
subsequent purchaser of such Notes from it of the resale restrictions referred to in (A) above.

(3) The purchaser understands that the Notes will, until the expiration of the applicable

holding period with respect to the Notes set forth in paragraph (d) of Rule 144 promulgated under the
Securities Act, unless otherwise agreed by us and the holder thereof, bear a legend substantially to
the following effect:

**This security (or its predecessor) was originally issued in a transaction**
**exempt from registration under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended**
**(the “Securities Act”), and this security may not be offered, sold or otherwise**
**transferred in the absence of such registration or an applicable exemption**
**therefrom. Each purchaser of this security is notified that the seller of this**
**security may be relying on the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of**
**the Securities Act provided by Rule 144A thereunder. By its acquisition**

Under the terms and subject to the conditions contained in the purchase agreement dated the date of this

offering circular, we have agreed to sell to the initial purchasers, and the initial purchasers for whom Citigroup Global
Markets Inc. is acting as representative, have agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase from us, the following
principal respective amount of the Notes:

**Initial Purchasers** **Principal Amount of the Notes**

Citigroup Global Markets Inc. ........................................................................ $

Barclays Capital Inc. ......................................................................................

UBS Securities LLC .......................................................................................

BofA Securities, Inc. ......................................................................................

U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc. ......................................................................

Total ............................................................................................................... $

One or more of the initial purchasers may use affiliates or other appropriately licensed entities for sales of

the Notes in jurisdictions in which such initial purchasers are not otherwise permitted to do so.

The purchase agreement provides that the initial purchasers are obligated to purchase all of the Notes if any

are purchased. The purchase agreement also provides that if an initial purchaser defaults, the purchase commitments
of non-defaulting initial purchasers may be increased or the offering may be terminated.

The initial purchasers propose to offer the Notes in the United States to persons reasonably believed to be

qualified institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A) in reliance on Rule 144A and outside the United States to nonU.S. persons in reliance on Regulations S initially at the offering price on the cover page of this offering circular.
After the initial offering, the offering price may be changed.

The Issuer and the guarantors have agreed not to, directly or indirectly,

    - offer for sale, sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of (or enter into any transaction or device that is designed
to, or could be expected to, result in the disposition by any person at any time in the future of) any of our
debt securities substantially similar to the Notes or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such
debt securities, or sell or grant options, rights or warrants with respect to such debt securities or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for such debt securities or

    - publicly announce an offering of any of our debt securities substantially similar to the Notes or securities
convertible or exchangeable into our debt securities, for a period of 60 days after the date of this offering
circular, in each case without the prior written consent of Citigroup Global Markets Inc. on behalf of the
initial purchasers.

We have agreed to indemnify the several initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities

under the Securities Act.

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. The initial purchasers have

advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable law. They are not obligated,
however, to make a market in the Notes and any market-making may be discontinued at any time at their sole
discretion. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the development or liquidity of any market for the Notes.

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the closing date

specified on the cover page of this offering circular, which will be the     business day following the date of pricing
of such Notes (this settlement cycle being referred to as “T+   ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the SEC under the Exchange
Act trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such
trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes before the Notes are delivered
will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle T+  , to specify an alternate settlement cycle
at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes before
the Notes are delivered should consult their own advisors.

The initial purchasers may engage in over allotment, stabilizing transactions and covering transactions in

accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act, as follows:

133


-----

purchasers;

    - stabilizing transactions permit bids to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do
not exceed a specified maximum; and

    - covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been
completed in order to cover short positions.

These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to be

higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions, if commenced, may be
discontinued at any time.

**Other Relationships**

The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various

activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment
management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the
initial purchasers and certain of their respective affiliates have, from time to time, provided, and may in the future
provide, investment banking, commercial banking and financial advisory services to us and our affiliates, for which
they have received customary compensation. The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates may effect
transactions for their own account or the account of customers, and hold on behalf of themselves or their customers,
long or short positions in our debt securities or loans, and may do so in the future. In addition, certain initial purchasers
and/or their affiliates are agents and/or lenders under the 2020 Term Loan and the 2019 Term Loan and therefore will
receive a portion of the net proceeds from this offering. See “Use of Proceeds.”

If any of the initial purchasers or their affiliates has a lending relationship with us, certain of those initial

purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge, and certain other of those initial purchasers or their affiliates may hedge,
their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, these initial
purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the
purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes
offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the
Notes offered hereby.

**Rule 144A and Regulation S**

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold

within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except to qualified institutional buyers in
reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S
under the Securities Act. Each of the initial purchasers has agreed that, except as permitted by the purchase agreement,
it will not offer, sell or deliver the Notes (i) as part of its distribution at any time or otherwise until 40 days after the
later of the commencement of the offering and the closing date, within the United States or to, or for the account or
benefit of, U.S. persons, and it will have sent to each broker/dealer to which it sells Notes in reliance on Regulation S
during such 40-day period, a confirmation or other notice detailing the restrictions on offers and sales of the Notes
within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. Terms used in this paragraph have the
meanings given to them by Regulation S under the Securities Act. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described
under “Transfer Restrictions.”

In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of the offering, an offer or sale of the Notes within the

United States by a broker/dealer (whether or not it is participating in the offering), may violate the registration
requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than pursuant to Rule 144A.

**Selling Restrictions**

This offering circular does not constitute an offer to sell to, or a solicitation of an offer to buy from, anyone

in any country or jurisdiction (i) in which such an offer or solicitation is not authorized, (ii) in which any person
making such offer or solicitation is not qualified to do so or (iii) in which any such offer or solicitation would otherwise
be unlawful. No action has been taken that would, or is intended to, permit a public offer of the Notes or possession
or distribution of this offering circular or any other offering or publicity material relating to the Notes in any country
or jurisdiction where any such action for that purpose is required. Accordingly, each initial purchaser has undertaken

134


-----

circular, form of application, advertisement or other document or information in any country or jurisdiction except
under circumstances that will, to the best of its knowledge and belief, result in compliance with any applicable laws
and regulations and all offers and sales of Notes by it will be made on the same terms.

**European Economic Area**

The securities are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,

sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) For these purposes,
a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of
Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97
(as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client
as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU)
2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently no key information document required by
Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the securities or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the
securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS
Regulation. This offering circular has been prepared on the basis that any offer of securities in any Member State of
the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a
prospectus for offers of securities. This offering circular is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus
Regulation.

In connection with the offering, the underwriters are not acting for anyone other than the issuer and will not

be responsible to anyone other than the issuer for providing the protections afforded to their clients nor for providing
advice in relation to the offering.

The above selling restriction is in addition to any other selling restrictions set out below.

**United Kingdom**

The securities are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,

sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (“UK”). For these purposes, a retail
investor means a person who is one (or more) of (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation
(EU) 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”);
or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (as amended,
the “FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) 600/2014
as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU)
2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently
no key information document required by Regulation (EU) 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of
the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to
retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them
available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation. This offering circular has
been prepared on the basis that any offer of securities in the UK will be made pursuant to an exemption under the UK
Prospectus Regulation and the FSMA from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of securities.

In connection with the offering, the underwriters are not acting for anyone other than the issuer and will not

be responsible to anyone other than the issuer for providing the protections afforded to their clients nor for providing
