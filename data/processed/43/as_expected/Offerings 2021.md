_Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors: The notes described in the Offering Memorandum are not_
intended to be offered, sold, distributed or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold,
distributed or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). For


-----

the purposes of this provision, the expression retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of the
following: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the
meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended from time to time, the “Insurance Mediation Directive”), where
that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II.
Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended from time
to time, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to retail
investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them
available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

The Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the securities referred to therein
in any Member State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the
“Prospectus Regulation”) from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the securities referred to
therein. Accordingly, any person making or intending to make an offer in a Member State of notes which are the
subject of the offering contemplated in the Offering Memorandum may only do so in circumstances in which no
obligation arises for the issuer or any of the initial purchasers to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the
Prospectus Regulation, in each case, in relation to such offer. Neither the issuer nor the initial purchasers have
authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of notes in circumstances in which an obligation arises
for the issuer or the initial purchasers to publish a prospectus for such offer.

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in
respect of the notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the notes is eligible counterparties and
professional clients only, each as defined in the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 2014/65/EU (as
amended, “MiFID II”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the notes to eligible counterparties and
professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the notes (a
“distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor
subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the notes (by
either adopting or refining the manufacturers target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution
channels.

_Prohibition of Sales to UK Retail Investors: The notes described in the Offering Memorandum are not_
intended to be offered, sold, distributed or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold,
distributed or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (“UK”). For the purposes, a
retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of the following: (i) a retail client as defined in point (8) of
Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union
(Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any
rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement the Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would
not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it
forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently no key information document required by the
PRIIPs Regulation as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for
offering, selling or distributing the notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK or the
United Kingdom has been prepared and therefore offering, selling or distributing the notes or otherwise making
them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation or the United
Kingdom.

The Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the notes referred to therein in
the UK will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation as it forms part of domestic law
by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”) from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers
of the securities referred to therein. Accordingly, any person making or intending to make an offer in the UK of
notes which are the subject of the offering contemplated in the Offering Memorandum may only do so in
circumstances in which no obligation arises for the issuer or any of the initial purchasers to publish a prospectus
pursuant to Article 3 of the UK Prospectus Regulation, in each case, in relation to such offer. Neither the issuer
nor the initial purchasers have authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of notes in
circumstances in which an obligation arises for the issuer or any of the initial purchasers to publish a prospectus
for such offer.

_UK MIFIR product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market: Solely for the_
purposes of the product approval process of any relevant initial purchaser that considers itself a manufacturer
pursuant to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR
Product Governance Rules”) (each a “UK Manufacturer” and, together, the “UK Manufacturers”), the target
market assessment in respect of the notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the notes is only
eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and
professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the notes to
eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or


-----

recommending the notes (a “UK distributor”) should take into consideration the UK Manufacturers’ target
market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules is responsible for
undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the notes (by either adopting or refining the UK
Manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

This communication is directed solely at (i) persons who have professional experience in matters relating to
investments and are investment professionals as defined within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (the “Order”), (ii) high net worth bodies corporate and any
other person falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) of the Order, (iii) persons outside the United Kingdom and
(iv) any other persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning
of section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) in connection with the issue or sale of any
securities may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together
being referred to as “relevant persons”). The Offering Memorandum must not be acted on or relied on by persons
who are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to which the Offering Memorandum relates
is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant persons. Any person who is not a
relevant person must not act or rely on the Offering Memorandum or any of its contents.

be purchasing as principal in accordance with applicable Canadian securities laws, for investment only and not

Any resale of Notes acquired by a Canadian purchaser in the Offering must be made in accordance with

regulatory authority. These resale restrictions may under certain circumstances apply to resales of the Notes
outside of Canada.

Securities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser with remedies for
rescission or damages if this offering memorandum (including any amendment thereto) contains a
misrepresentation, provided that the remedies for rescission or damages are exercised by the purchaser within the
time limit prescribed by the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory. The purchaser should
refer to any applicable provisions of the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory for
particulars of these rights, or consult with a legal advisor.

Canadian purchasers are advised that this document has been prepared in reliance on Section 3A.3 of
National Instrument 33-105 Underwriting Conflicts (“NI 33-105”). Pursuant to section 3A.3 of NI 33-105, this
document is exempt from the requirement that the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers in the Offering provide
Canadian purchasers with certain conflicts of interest disclosure pertaining to “connected issuer” and/or “related
issuer” relationships as would otherwise be required pursuant to subsection 2.1(1) of NI 33-105.

_tout avis) soient rédigés en anglais seulement._

**European Economic Area**

Each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold or otherwise made available
and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available, any Notes that are the subject of the Offering contemplated
by this Offering Memorandum to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a
person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU
(as amended from time to time, “MiFID II”) or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as
amended from time to time, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined
in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended from time to time, the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently, no
key information document required by the PRIIPS Regulation for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise
making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the
Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS
Regulation. This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in any
member state of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the
requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the
purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

Each subscriber for or purchaser of the Notes in the Offering located within a member state of the EEA will
be deemed to have represented, acknowledged and agreed that it is not a retail investor. The Issuer, the Initial
Purchasers and their affiliates and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the foregoing representation,
acknowledgement and agreement.

**MiFID II Product Governance / professional investors and eligible counterparties only target market:**
Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect
of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is “eligible counterparties” and
“professional clients” only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to
eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or
recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturer’s target market
assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market
assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturer’s target market assessment)
and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**United Kingdom**

This Offering Memorandum is being distributed only to and is directed only at: (i) persons who have
professional experience in matters relating to investments and are “investment professionals” as defined within

Order, (iii) persons outside the United Kingdom and (iv) persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage

(“FSMA”)) in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes may otherwise be lawfully communicated or caused
to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as “relevant persons”).

This Offering Memorandum must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not relevant persons. Any
investment or investment activity to which this Offering Memorandum relates is available only to relevant persons
and will be engaged in only with relevant persons. Recipients of this Offering Memorandum are not permitted to
transmit it to any other person. The Notes are not being offered to the public in the United Kingdom. Any person
who is not a relevant person should not act or rely on this Offering Memorandum or any of its contents.

Each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that: (i) it has only communicated or caused to be
communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in
investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue
or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer; and (ii) it
has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA in respect of anything done by it in
relation to any Notes in, from or otherwise involving, the United Kingdom.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes referred to herein in
the United Kingdom will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”) from the requirement to publish a
prospectus for offers of the securities referred to herein. Accordingly, any person making or intending to make an
offer in the United Kingdom of Notes which are the subject of the offering contemplated in this preliminary
offering memorandum may only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Issuer or any of the
Initial Purchasers to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the UK Prospectus Regulation, in each case, in
relation to such offer. Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor do they authorize, the
making of any offer of Notes in circumstances in which an obligation arises for the Issuer or any of the Initial
Purchasers to publish a prospectus for such offer.

The Notes described in the Offering Memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold, distributed or
otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold, distributed or otherwise made available to any retail
investor in the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of:
(i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic
law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning
of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance
Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of
Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA.
Consequently no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation as it forms part of domestic law
by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering, selling or distributing the Notes or otherwise
making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering, selling or
distributing the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom may be
unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of any relevant Initial Purchaser that considers itself
a manufacturer pursuant to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the

v


-----

“UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) (each a “UK Manufacturer” and, together, the “UK Manufacturers”),
the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the
Notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook
(“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law
by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of
the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering,
selling or recommending the Notes (a “UK distributor”) should take into consideration the UK Manufacturers’
target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules is
responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or
refining the UK Manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

**The Issuer**

The Issuer was incorporated on September 8, 2020, for purposes of facilitating the Transactions and
performing certain activities related thereto. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Issuer has no
revenue-generating activities of its own, and no business operations, material assets or liabilities other than those
acquired or incurred in connection with its incorporation and the Transactions. As a result, no financial
information of the Issuer is included in this Offering Memorandum, except for certain limited as adjusted
financial data presented on an as adjusted to reflect certain effects of the Transactions. As of the date of this
Offering Memorandum, the Issuer owns approximately 90.6% of the Shares. After completion of the SqueezeOut, the Issuer will own 100% of the Shares. See “As Adjusted Financial Information” “Summary—Summary
_Consolidated Financial and Other Information As Adjusted Data of the Issuer” and “Capitalization.”_

**Ahlstrom-Munksjö**

All historical financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum is that of Ahlstrom-Munksjö
Oyj and its consolidated subsidiaries. Accordingly, unless otherwise stated, all references to “AhlstromMunksjö,” “we,” “us,” or “our” in respect of historical financial information in this Offering Memorandum are to
Ahlstrom-Munksjö Oyj and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.

**_Historical Financial Information_**

This Offering Memorandum includes our historical consolidated financial statements listed below (together,
the “Financial Statements”):

   - the audited consolidated annual financial statements of Ahlstrom-Munksjö Oyj and its subsidiaries as
of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the “2018 Financial Statements”);

   - the audited consolidated annual financial statements of Ahlstrom-Munksjö Oyj and its subsidiaries as
of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 (the “2019 Financial Statements”); and

   - the audited consolidated annual financial statements of Ahlstrom-Munksjö Oyj and its subsidiaries as
of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 (the “2020 Financial Statements”).

**_Comparability of the Financial Statements_**

_Presentation of Income Statement_

On January 1, 2020, we changed the presentation of our income statement to the function of expense method
from the nature of expense method, to align with our internal reporting. In the 2020 Financial Statements, the
comparative income statement information for the year ended December 31, 2019 has been restated according to the
function of expense method, to facilitate comparability, and is unaudited. The income statement in the 2019
Financial Statements and in the 2018 Financial Statements were presented using the nature of expense method. In
connection with the adoption of the function of expense method, certain minor reclassifications and changes in
names of income statement items have been made in the 2020 Financial Statements. Certain income statement items
previously reported within net sales, such as operative exchange gains and losses and operative foreign exchange
derivative results, were classified to other income statement lines. In addition, certain accounting policy alignments
were made between net sales and other operating income relating to previous acquisitions, and the income from the
sale of emission and other environmental rights previously classified in other operating expenses was reclassified to
other operating income. Due to these reclassifications, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased by
€1.0 million and other operating income for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by €8.6 million. The
reclassifications had no impact on our operating result or net result for the year ended December 31, 2019. In the
2020 Financial Statements certain income statement line items were renamed, such as net profit to net result and
profit before tax to result before tax. As a result, the 2019 Financial Statements and the 2018 Financial Statements
are not directly comparable with the 2020 Financial Statements or the 2019 comparative, unaudited, restated column
presented therein. In order to provide meaningful comparable financial information in this Offering Memorandum,
income statement information from the year ended December 31, 2019 is presented on an audited historical basis
when comparing to the financial information for the year ended December 31, 2018, and, otherwise, is extracted
without adjustment from the unaudited, restated comparative column included in the 2020 Financial Statements. See
also note 2 in the 2020 Financial Statements for further information.

_Changes to Reportable Segments_

In 2019, we decided to implement a new business structure, which became effective on January 1, 2020, to
promote core business capabilities and sharpen strategic targets and align the business characteristics of each
business area. For periods after January 1, 2020, our five business areas comprise Filtration & Performance
Solutions, Advance Solutions, Industrial Solutions, Food Packaging & Technical Solutions, and Decor Solutions,
which five business areas also form our operating and reporting segments. For periods prior to January 1, 2020,
our five business areas comprised Filtration & Performance Solutions, Industrial Solutions, Decor, Specialties,
and North American Specialty Solutions. Our segmental reporting also includes Other and eliminations, which
includes head office costs comprising the group finance, corporate development, legal, research and
development, group communications, investor relations and group human resources.

In the new business structure, North America Specialty Solutions is integrated into the other business areas,
and businesses are partly reorganized to reflect our expansion in North America following the initial integration
phase of the North America Specialty Solutions business. The new business structure is comprised of sixteen
businesses that underlie the five business areas, as compared to fourteen businesses under our previous structure.
In the 2020 Financial Statements, we have restated our presentation of the financial information of our business
areas for the comparative year ended December 31, 2019 to reflect the new business structure and the restated
comparative business area information is unaudited. The business area financial information for the year ended
December 31, 2018 is presented based on our previous business areas and is therefore not comparable to the
business area information presented in the 2020 Financial Statements. In order to provide meaningful comparable
information in this Offering Memorandum, we present the financial information for the business areas for the
year ended December 31, 2019 based on the prior business areas when comparing to the financial information for
the year ended December 31, 2018, and, otherwise, based on the new business areas. See note 4 to the 2020
Financial Statements for further information on our new business area information.

_Segment Reporting Principles_

Our CEO, assisted by the Executive Management Team, is our chief operating decision maker. Operating
segments are determined on the basis of information reviewed by the CEO for the purposes of allocating
resources and assessing our business area’s performance. Each business area’s performance is assessed internally
on the basis of net sales and Comparable EBITDA. For internal management reporting purposes, Comparable
EBITDA is defined as operating result before depreciation, amortization and impairments and excluding items
affecting comparability. We define items affecting comparability as material items outside ordinary course of
business, such as gains and losses on business disposals, direct transaction costs related to business acquisitions,
costs for closure of business operations and restructurings including redundancy payments, one-off items arising
from purchase price allocation such as inventory fair value adjustments, compensation related to environmental
damages arising from unexpected or rare events and other items including fines (such as VAT tax audit fines) or
other similar stipulated payments and litigations.

For the year ended December 31, 2018 and following the acquisitions of Expera Specialty Solutions and
Caieiras, each business area’s performance was assessed internally on the basis of its net sales and Comparable
EBITDA, in each case pro forma for the acquisitions of Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras. Net sales, pro
forma for the acquisitions of Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras, is defined for internal management
reporting purposes as net sales giving pro forma effect to the net sales impact of the acquisitions of Expera
Specialty Solutions and Caieiras. Comparable EBITDA pro forma for the acquisitions of Expera Specialty
Solutions and Caieiras is defined for internal reporting purposes as EBITDA excluding certain items affecting
comparability and giving pro forma effect to the acquisitions of Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras. The pro
forma impact of the acquisitions of Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras on net sales and Comparable
EBITDA for internal management reporting purposes is presented as if Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras
had been consolidated to full-year results for the year ended December 31, 2018. See also “—Acquisitions and
_Disposals—Acquisitions of Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras” below._

_Acquisitions and Disposals_

_Acquisitions of Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras_

We acquired Expera Specialty Solutions Holdings, Inc. (“Expera Specialty Solutions”), a U.S. based
specialty paper producer, on October 10, 2018, and MD Papéis’ Caieiras (“Caieiras”), a specialty paper mill in
Brazil, on October 17, 2018. Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras were consolidated into our historical
consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition and are included in the statement of

xiv


-----

financial position as of December 31, 2018. The consolidated income statement or statement of cash flows for
any period prior to such dates do not include the impact of such acquisitions. As a result, given the magnitude of
the acquisitions of Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras, the income statement or statement of cash flows in
the 2018 Financial Statements are not comparable to the income statement or statement of cash flows for any
subsequent period. For internal management reporting purposes, certain business area information has been
presented as if Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras had been consolidated for the results of the year ended
December 31, 2018 and is included in the footnotes to the 2019 and 2018 Financial Statements prepared in
accordance with IFRS 8 (Operating Statements) and is presented on a comparable basis to such information for
the year ended December 31, 2019. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operations—Results of Operations—Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with Year Ended_
_December 31, 2018—Net Sales—Net Sales by Business Area,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of_
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—EBITDA and Comparable EBITDA—_
_Comparable EBITDA by business area for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018” and_
note 4 to each of the 2019 Financial Statements and the 2018 Financial Statements.

_Other Acquisitions and Divestments_

During the periods under review, we made an acquisition to grow our Liquid Technologies business in 2019
and completed two divestments in 2020. As a result, our consolidated financial information may not be
comparable following the date of such acquisition or divestments.

_Reclassification of Certain Balance Sheet Items_

In 2019, we changed the classification of certain balance sheet items between interest-bearing and
non-interest-bearing liabilities. The comparative information as of December 31, 2018 has been restated
accordingly. The restatement as of December 31, 2018 from current borrowings to trade and other payables
amounted to €8.8 million. In 2019, lease liabilities were also reclassified from borrowings to a separate line item,
and lease liabilities as of December 31, 2018 were restated accordingly. The lease liabilities as of December 31,
2018 relate to finance leases in accordance with previously used IAS 17 (Leases) and the related interpretations,
which were replaced by IFRS 16 as of January 1, 2019. The restated information is unaudited.

_Changes to Accounting Standards_

We adopted the changes described below to accounting standards during the periods under review. These
other amendments did not have material impact on the amounts recognized in prior periods and are not expected
to significantly affect the current or future periods. See note 2 to each of the Financial Statements for further
information on accounting policies adopted during the relevant period.

_IFRS 16_

We adopted IFRS 16 (Leases) on January 1, 2019. IFRS 16 replaced IAS 17 (Leases) as well as the IFRIC
and SIC interpretations of IAS 17. The adoption of IFRS 16 resulted in almost all leases being recognized on the
balance sheet, as IFRS 16 eliminated the distinction between operating and finance leases. Under IFRS 16, the
lessee recognizes an asset (the right-to-use the leased asset) and a financial liability to make lease payments.
There are exceptions only for short-term and low-value leases. In accordance with IFRS 16, operating expenses
relating to leases are replaced by depreciation and interest expenses, resulting in changes to certain key metrics
including EBITDA. We adopted IFRS 16 using a simplified approach and thus comparative figures have not
been restated. The adoption of IFRS 16 increased the right-of-use assets under non-current assets by
€57.0 million, non-current lease liability by €44.1 million and current lease liability by €12.3 million in the
opening balance sheet as of January 1, 2019. The implementation of IFRS 16 had a positive impact of
€16.3 million on EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019. See notes 2, 8, 9 and 12 to the 2019 Financial
Statements for more information.

_IFRIC 23_

We adopted IFRIC 23 (Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments) on January 1, 2019. IFRIC 23 clarifies the
accounting for uncertainties in income taxes. As a result of the adoption of IFRIC 23, we recognized an
adjustment in an amount of €2.6 million in the opening balance sheet as of January 1, 2019 as a deduction in the
retained earnings and an increase in income tax liabilities. Our financial statements as of and for the year ended

xv


-----

December 31, 2018 do not apply IFRIC 23. As a result, the results of operations for the year ended December 31,
2018 may not be directly comparable with the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and
2020.

_Impact of the Transactions_

On October 22, 2020, the Issuer launched the Tender Offer to acquire up to all of the Company Shares for
cash consideration equal to the Tender Offer Price. On February 4, 2021, following the first settlement of the
Tender Offer, the Issuer acquired approximately 81.0% of the Company Shares. On February 10, 2021, following
the settlement of the subsequent offer period, the Issuer acquired an additional 9.6% of the Shares. As of the date
of this Offering Memorandum, 2021, the Issuer owned approximately 90.6% of the Company Shares. After
completion of the Squeeze-Out, the Issuer will own 100% of the Company Shares. See “Summary—The
_Transactions—The Tender Offer.” None of the financial information in this Offering Memorandum has been_
adjusted to reflect the impact of any changes to the consolidated statement of financial position, consolidated
income statement and other comprehensive income (statement of comprehensive income), consolidated statement
of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows that might occur as a result of purchase accounting
adjustments to be applied as a result of the Transactions. We will account for the Acquisition using the
acquisition method of accounting in accordance with IFRS 3 (Business Combinations). The application of
purchase accounting could result in different carrying values for existing assets and assets that may be added to
the statement of financial position, which may include intangible assets, such as goodwill, brands, rights of use,
contractual rights with franchisees leasehold rights and software, and different amortization and depreciation
expenses. Only certain limited as adjusted financial data of the Issuer is presented as adjusted to give effect to the
Transactions, including the Notes offered hereby. See “—As _Adjusted_ _Financial_ _Information”_ and
“Capitalization.” In the future, we may report our consolidated financial condition and results of operations at the
level of the Issuer, or at another entity, rather than at Ahlstrom-Munksjö. Due to these and other potential
adjustments, future financial statements for the Group could be materially different and may not be comparable
to our Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. See also “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting the Comparability_
_of the Financial Statements—Impact of the Transactions” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and_
_Operations—An impairment of goodwill, other tangible assets or property, plant and equipment could have a_
_material adverse effect on our financial position or operating results.”_

**As Adjusted Financial Information**

This Offering Memorandum includes certain financial information as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2020 on an adjusted basis to give effect to the Transactions and the application of the proceeds
therefrom. The as adjusted financial information comprises certain audited statement of financial position
information and cash and cash equivalents as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 of Ahlstrom-Munksjö
as adjusted to give the effect of the Transactions, including our indebtedness as if the Transactions had occurred
on December 31, 2020 and our interest expense as if the Transactions had occurred on January 1, 2020. See
“Summary—Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information As Adjusted Data of the Issuer” and
“Capitalization.” The as adjusted financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 has been
prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not represent what the Issuer’s indebtedness or interest expense
would have been had the Transactions occurred on December 31, 2020 or January 1, 2020, respectively, nor does
it purport to project the Issuer’s indebtedness or interest expense at any future date. The as adjusted financial
information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 has not been prepared in accordance with IFRS, the
requirements of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act, the Prospectus Regulation or any generally accepted
accounting standards. Neither the assumptions underlying the adjustments nor the resulting as adjusted financial
information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 have been audited or reviewed in accordance with
any generally accepted auditing standards.

**Non-IFRS Financial Measures**

This Offering Memorandum contains non-IFRS measures and ratios, including EBITDA, Comparable
EBITDA, Comparable EBITDA Margin, As Adjusted EBITDA, Operating Working Capital, Capital
expenditure, Maintenance capital expenditure, Cash conversion, Free cash flow, MOVC / ton, MOVC margin,
adjusted operating cash flow and other measures, which, in accordance with the “Alternative Performance
_Measures” guidance issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) are not accounting_
measures defined or specified in IFRS and are, therefore, considered alternative performance measures and as

xvi


-----

such comply with the ESMA guidance applicable to Ahlstrom-Munksjö as a listed company subject to EU
regulation. Such non-IFRS measures and ratios may not reflect accurately our performance, liquidity or our
ability to incur debt and should not be considered as a substitute to net result or any other performance measures
derived from or in accordance with IFRS, SEC requirements or any other generally accepted accounting
principles or as a substitute to net cash from/(used in) operating activities. The financial information contained in
this Offering Memorandum is not intended to comply with the reporting requirements of the SEC and will not be
subject to review by the SEC. As used in this Offering Memorandum, the following terms have the following
meanings:

   - “EBITDA” represents result before taxes, net financial items, depreciation, amortization and
impairment. The definition of EBITDA is compliant with ESMA guidance but is not intended to and
does not comply with the SEC definition of EBITDA as “Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization”;

   - “Comparable EBITDA” represents EBITDA excluding items affecting comparability in EBITDA, such
as material items outside the ordinary course of business, such as gains and losses on business
disposals, direct transaction costs related to business acquisitions, costs for closure of business
operations and restructurings including redundancy payments, one-off items arising from purchase
price allocation such as inventory fair value adjustments, compensation related to environmental
damages arising from unexpected or rare events and other items, including fines (such as VAT tax
audit fines) or other similar stipulated payments and litigation, but excluding impairment losses in each
case, as further described under “Summary—Summary _Consolidated_ _Financial_ _and_ _Other_
_Information—As Adjusted Data of the Issuer”;_

   - “Comparable EBITDA Margin” represents Comparable EBITDA divided by net sales;

   - “As Adjusted EBITDA” represents Comparable EBITDA as adjusted for certain cost savings
programs, certain post-acquisition savings programs and a COVID-19 normalization, in each case, as
further described under “Summary—Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information—As
_Adjusted Data of the Issuer”;_

   - “Operating Working Capital” represents inventories plus operative receivables before factoring less
operating payables;

   - “Capital expenditure” represents purchases for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, as
presented in the consolidated cash flow statement;

   - “Capital expenditure to net sales ratio” represents Capital expenditure divided by net sales;

   - “Maintenance capital expenditure” represents 3% of net sales based on a management estimated based
on long-term average capital expenditures;

   - “Cash conversion” represents Free cash flow divided by Comparable EBITDA;

   - “Free cash flow” represents Comparable EBITDA minus Maintenance capital expenditure;

   - “MOVC” or “margin over variable costs” represents net sales minus variable costs of sales;

   - “MOVC / ton” represents our margin over variable costs per ton;

   - “MOVC margin” represents MOVC divided by net sales; and

   - “Adjusted operating cash flow” represents net cash from operating activities plus total items affecting
comparability in operating result net of taxes relating to items affecting comparability in operating
result.

We present non-IFRS measures for information purposes only. There can be no assurance that items we
have identified for adjustment as non-recurring will not recur in the future or that similar items will not be
incurred in the future. The calculations for Comparable EBITDA and As Adjusted EBITDA are based on various
assumptions, including, in the case of As Adjusted EBITDA, successful implementation of certain initiatives and
management or sponsor estimates. These amounts have not been, and, in certain cases, cannot be, audited,
reviewed or verified by any independent auditors’ firm. This information is inherently subject to risks and
uncertainties. It may not give an accurate or complete picture of the financial condition or results of operations
for the periods presented, may not be comparable to our consolidated financial statements or the other financial
information included in this Offering Memorandum, and should not be relied upon when making an investment
decision.

xvii


-----

We present non-IFRS measures because we believe that they are helpful to investors as measures of our
operating performance and ability to service our debt, and that they and similar measures are widely used by
certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and
liquidity. The non-IFRS measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies
and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of
our operating results as reported under IFRS. These non-IFRS measures and ratios are not measurements of our
performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered as a substitute for revenue or net result for the
period or any other performance or liquidity measures derived in accordance with IFRS or any other generally
accepted accounting principles or as a substitute to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities.
EBITDA and its variants as presented in this Offering Memorandum may differ from similarly titled measures
used by other companies and from “Consolidated EBITDA” contained and defined in the section entitled
“Description of the Notes” of this Offering Memorandum and in the Indenture. For a reconciliation of EBITDA,
Comparable EBITDA and As Adjusted EBITDA of the Issuer, see “Summary—Summary Selected Consolidated
_Financial and Other Information—Other Financial and As Adjusted Information.”_

The non-IFRS measures we present may also be defined differently than the corresponding terms under the
Indenture. Some of the limitations of these non-IFRS measures are that:

   - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual
commitments;

   - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

   - they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service
interest or principal payments on our debt;

   - they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay;

   - they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not to
be indicative of our ongoing operations;

   - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and
amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and EBITDA-based measures do not reflect any
cash requirements that would be required for such replacements;

   - they may include adjustments for non-cash items and not adjust for all items that impact cash flows;

   - some of the items that we eliminate in calculating certain EBITDA-based measures reflect cash
payments that were made, or will in the future be made; and

   - other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their
usefulness as comparative measures.

Because of these limitations, such metrics should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash
available to invest in the growth of the business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our
obligations. In addition, any of our historical financial information does not take into account any purchase price
accounting or other adjustments to give effect to the Transactions and our indebtedness will not be comparable to
our indebtedness following the Transactions. See “—Ahlstrom-Munksjo¨—Comparability of the Financial
_Statements—Impact of the Transactions” above and “Capitalization.” You should compensate for these_
limitations by relying primarily on the IFRS results and using these non-IFRS measures only supplementally to
evaluate the Group’s performance. See “Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information,” “Selected
_Historical Financial Information,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results_
_of Operations” and the Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Offering_
Memorandum.

**INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

In this Offering Memorandum, we rely on and refer to information regarding our business and the market in
which we operate and compete. Certain market data and economic and industry data and forecasts used in this
Offering Memorandum were obtained from internal surveys, market research, governmental and other publicly
available information, independent industry publications and reports prepared by industry consultants. These
include information published by Smithers and others. In certain instances, our analysis and best estimates of
statistics, data and other information relating to markets, market sizes, market shares, market positions and other
industry data pertaining to our business and the markets that we operate in are based on certain third party
sources, including services commissioned from Boston Consulting Group, Smithers and other third-party
sources. In the absence of any such information, we have made statements regarding our industry and market
shares based on our experience, our own investigation of market conditions and our management’s best
estimates. In considering the industry and market data included in this Offering Memorandum, prospective
investors should note that this information may be subject to significant uncertainty due to differing definitions of
the relevant markets and market segments described. In many cases, there is no readily available external
information (whether from trade associations, government bodies or other organizations) to validate market
related analyses and estimates, thus requiring us to rely on internally developed data. Additionally, many of our
competitors do not publicly disclose their financial information. Consequently, we have made our estimates
largely based on internal surveys and studies. While we believe our estimates to be reliable, they have not been
verified by any independent sources and we cannot assure you that any of our assumptions are accurate or
correctly reflect our position in the industry. Certain forward-looking statements contained in such industry and
market data were made prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and have not been updated to account
for the impact of such outbreak. There can be no assurance that such forward-looking statements would not have
been materially different if the COVID-19 pandemic had been taken into account. See “Forward-looking
_Statements.” Market data and statistics are inherently predictive and subject to uncertainty and not necessarily_
reflective of actual market conditions. Such statistics are based on market research, which itself is based on
sampling and subjective judgments by both the researchers and the respondents, including judgments about what
types of products and transactions should be included in the relevant market. Additionally, industry publications
and reports from management consultants generally state that the information contained therein has been
obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but that the accuracy and completeness of such information is not
guaranteed and in some instances state that they do not assume liability for such information. Neither we nor any
of the Initial Purchasers nor any of their respective affiliates make any representation as to the accuracy of such
information. While neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers are aware of any misstatements regarding the
industry, market or similar data presented in this Offering Memorandum, such data involves risks and
uncertainties and is subject to change based on various factors, including those discussed under “Risk Factors” in
this Offering Memorandum.

**CURRENCIES AND EXCHANGE RATES**

We publish our Financial Statements in euro. The following table sets forth, for the periods set forth below,
the high, low, average and period end Bloomberg Composite Rate (London) expressed as U.S. dollars per €1.00.
The Bloomberg Composite Rate is a “best market” calculation, in which, at any point in time, the bid rate is
equal to the highest bid rate of all contributing bank indications and the ask rate is set to the lowest ask rate
offered by these banks. The Bloomberg Composite Rate is a mid-value rate between the applied highest bid rate
and the lowest ask rate. The below rates may differ from the actual rates used in the preparation of the Financial
Statements and other financial information appearing in this Offering Memorandum. Neither we nor any of the
Initial Purchasers represents that the euro or U.S. dollar amounts referred to in this Offering Memorandum have
been, could have been or could, in the future, be converted into U.S. dollars or euro, as the case may be, at any
particular rate, if at all.

The average rate for a year means the average of the Bloomberg Composite Rates on the last Business Day
of each month during a year. The average rate for a month, or for any shorter period, means the average of the
daily Bloomberg Composite Rates during that month, or shorter period, as the case may be.

**Overview**

We are a global leader in the production of high-performance fiber-based materials for a variety of
consumer and industrial end-uses. Our products are used in a broad range of industrial applications and
consumer-driven products and processes, ranging from everyday consumables, health care and life sciences,
homebuilding and furniture, industrial goods and transportation. Sustainability is central across our businesses,
and with our product offering we facilitate a sustainable everyday life by providing solutions with better
performance, safer materials, fewer resources and a lower environmental impact. Our net sales, operating result,
net result and Comparable EBITDA were €2,683.3 million, €176.2 million, €94.5 million and €334.2 million,
respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020 and our As Adjusted EBITDA was €412.6 million for the
year ended December 31, 2020.

We produce fiber-based materials from pulp and other fibers, and then typically sell such materials to
converters who incorporate them in their end-products. We also produce certain end-products ourselves. Our
product offering includes filter materials, release liners, food and beverage processing and packaging materials,
decor papers, abrasive and tape backings, electrotechnical insulation paper, glass fiber materials, medical fabrics
and solutions for diagnostics, and a range of other specialty materials and pulp for industrial and consumer
end-uses. We develop our products in close cooperation with customers and other stakeholders in the valuechain, making use of our high technical expertise and broad experience. We design our custom-made and tailored
materials with a high degree of differentiation to meet and exceed specific customer demands concerning quality
and functionality, adding value for customers.

We target niche markets that benefit from value-based pricing and require technical specialization making it
more challenging for new market entrants. As a niche player, identifying trends and developing new customer
solutions are critical for our business. We have a strong focus on innovation and aim to regularly refresh our
offering and to improve sustainable functionality and design. Our recent innovations include FortiCell[®] launched
in 2020, a new range of fiber-based solutions for energy storage applications using amongst others our DISPRO
foam-forming technology, Extia[®] Protect, a comprehensive range of materials for face masks using fine fiber
technology, and BioWeb[®] and Fiber+ ranges, which use renewable biopolymer polylactic acid for producing
biodegradable and compostable tea bag materials. Our sales from New Products increased to 12% for the year
ended December 31, 2020.

We serve a diverse customer base with more than 6,000 customers in over 100 countries. For the year ended
December 31, 2020, 37% of our sales were to customers in the consumer goods sector, 27% in the homebuilding
and furniture sector, 14% in the transportation sector, 11% in the industrials sector and 11% in the health care
and life sciences sector. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our top-five and top-ten largest customers
generated 13% and 19% of our net sales, respectively.

We manufacture our products globally and have 45 manufacturing plants and converting sites in 14
countries. We consume commodity pulp as part of the manufacturing process. Our commodity pulp consumption
was approximately 1,200 thousand tons for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our pulp exposure was reduced
by approximately 500 thousand tons of our own pulp production during that same period, which includes
185 thousand tons of market pulp production at our Aspa pulp mill in Sweden that is sold to third parties. We
believe that our global manufacturing footprint represents a competitive advantage and would be challenging for
new market entrants to replicate given its specification and scale. Our manufacturing sites are equipped to
provide and apply innovative technology, including FluoroFree[®] capabilities (providing grease resistance without

fluorochemicals), Parchmentizing technology (transforming cellulose to give it plastic-like qualities) and fine
fiber technology with multi-row spinning, which was recently adapted to also produce face masks. We delivered
a total of approximately 1,570 thousand tons of materials in the year ended December 31, 2020. We organize
delivery of our products directly to many of our business-to-business customers using third-party transport
service providers.

We were formed by the merger of Ahlstrom Corporation and Munksjö Oyj on April 1, 2017, which created
a global leader in the production of high-performance fiber-based materials. Our two predecessor companies
have a long history in the Finnish and Swedish forestry and paper industry. Since the merger, we have grown
significantly through the acquisitions of the Caieiras specialty paper mill in Brazil and Expera Specialty
Solutions in North America, each in October 2018.

**Strengths**

**_Leading producer of environmental and sustainability focused high performance fiber-based materials_**
**_requiring technical specialization making it more challenging for new market participants as compared to_**
**_commodity paper_**

We are a leading producer of specialty, high-performance fiber-based materials which contribute to a more
sustainable everyday life. Our specialty products have attractive price points and margins, as we are generally
able to set prices based on value, as compared to the cost-plus pricing of commodity products. In addition, the
specialty, high-performance market is growing in line with the increasing customer focus on health, safety and
sustainability, on which our business is focused, with an expected annual growth of approximately two to five
percent. This growth rate is particularly attractive when compared to commodities. The following table illustrates
the attractive price points based on the higher average selling prices and margins, market growth and average
gross margins of specialty materials as compared to the commodity paper markets.

Sustainability is central across our business. In response to increasing customer focus on sustainability and
demand for sustainable products and solutions, we design and launch solutions with better performance, safer
materials, fewer resources and a lower environmental impact. We provide sustainable and safe food packaging
and focus on compostable and biodegradable solutions. Our mineral oil barrier paper, paraffin wax-free paper,
FluoroFree[®] technology providing fluorochemicals-free grease-resistant papers, tea-bags, flushable wipes and
other products directly cater to a market trend towards more sustainable solutions and respond to stricter food
safety and chemical regulations. We also produce “Plastic Free” products such as plastic-free tea bags, singleserve coffee and casing materials, GenReleaz[™], cards for collection of bio samples, and our CelluStraw[™] an
alternative to the plastic straw. Our “Plastic Free” products provide alternatives to single-use plastics alongside
improved packaging functionality. We also produce recyclable products that help support the circular economy
by reducing waste. We believe increasing customer awareness towards health and safety is also partially driving
the market for our formaldehyde free papers, water purification filter media using its proprietary Disruptor[®]
technology, air and liquid filtration products, facemasks and other products.

Our businesses are also characterized by a high level of technological, customization and qualification
requirements as is required to effectively compete in our relevant markets, which we believe makes it more
challenging for new market participants. Technical and engineered products, in particular, involve manufacturing
complexity, R&D and investment and heightened environmental and safety standards. We operate a global
manufacturing platform, in which we have made significant investments over the prior year, that grants us a
competitive advantage over competitors and that may be hard for competitors to replicate. Product designs for
specific customer specifications, in particular, often require joint product development with the customers and
sometimes take several years to develop. In addition, many of our products require rigorous certifications and/or
long qualification processes, such as certifications for products destined for the aerospace industry and customer
qualification standards for composite release liners and high technical specifications for filter media solutions,
which help to protect our businesses from both conversion risk and other market players. In the year ended
December 31, 2019, we had customers covering 17% of our net sales with whom we had a relationship of over
10 years, demonstrating our ability to produce specialty, high-performance materials to the degree of specificity
and with the certifications that they require.

We believe that our leading positions in these strategic segments are a reflection of our customer-centric
value proposition based on innovation, quality and service. Being a leader in our strategic segments provides us
with a competitive advantage as our larger size enables more efficient operations, provides us with a better ability
to meet customer needs and affords us more resources in research and development, which we believe
encourages customers to want to collaborate with us. This, in turn, helps us capture market share from smaller,
local players and positions us to capture growth in the market. Being a leader also enables us to attract and retain
qualified and experienced personnel.

**_Limited exposure to raw material cost and proven pricing power_**

We have a structured and systematic procurement process and have been able to improve our margin over
variable costs (“MOVC”) during 2020 despite volatility in pulp prices due to the low price sensitivity of our
products and by ensuring commercial excellence, business development, innovation and product development,
cost efficiency and productivity and optimizing our business processes and investments. Our MOVC per ton was
€674, €660, €699 and €721 on average in each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020,
respectively. Our cost base is primarily variable, with variable costs, such as fibers, including pulp, other raw
materials and energy, constituting 65% of our total costs for the year ended December 31, 2020, as detailed
below:

**Fixed costs: ~35%**
**Variable costs: ~65%**

Our commodity pulp consumption was approximately 1,200 thousand tons for the year ended December 31,
2020. Our pulp exposure was reduced by approximately 500 thousand tons of our own pulp production during the
year ended December 31, 2020, which includes 185 thousand tons of market pulp production at our Aspa pulp
mill in Sweden that is sold to third parties. We are typically able to pass through a portion of, or, depending on
the business, the entirety of, any increases in the cost of pulp to our customers by increasing the selling prices of
our products. We typically include contractual or indexed pass-through clauses in our contracts with customers.
For the remainder, we have a strong historical track record of being able to pass through price increases to our
customers, which is possible due to our strong market positions, our exposure to attractive and niche specialty
markets, our value-based pricing approach and the low price sensitivity for many of our products. This low price
sensitivity is the result of our products often being a vital part of our customers’ finished goods and as a result
constitute a relatively low proportion of the overall cost thereof. In addition, our products often perform a key
niche function in the finished good, in contrast to commodity paper, further contributing to low price sensitivity.
The specialized nature of our products also aids in our ability to pass-through increases in raw materials prices as
often they are difficult to replace or substitute. The natural hedge from our own pulp production, combined with
the low price sensitivity of our products and our strong ability to pass-through pulp price increases to customers,
helps to ensure that our profit and cash flows are highly resilient from swings in pulp prices. For instance MOVC
per ton remained relatively stable between 2017 and 2018, decreasing only by 2% or €14 per ton, even though
pulp prices increased by 30% during that period.

In addition, in 2020, we focused on increasing margins and improving overall profitability by initiating cost
savings program. Our €50 million savings program focused on variable cost reduction through procurement
savings and other improvement actions was completed ahead of schedule and exceeded targets. We believe that
our largely variable cost base provides intrinsic resilience to downturns. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic,
we were also able to achieve temporary fixed cost savings of approximately €24 million in the year ended
December 31, 2020, respectively, as a result of measures, such as implementation of temporary layoffs, reduction
of working hours and the minimization of the use of external personnel and services, reduced spending,
postponement of projects and temporary salary decreases. The following chart shows our quarterly performance
in 2019 as compared to 2020, demonstrating our resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic:

**_Diversified business model across customer-base, end-markets and geographies_**

We provide our products and solutions to a diverse base of over 6,000 customers engaged in a variety of
industries, including healthcare & life sciences, engineered industrial products, transportation, food & beverages,
consumer goods, construction and furniture, across more than 100 countries. Our top ten customers generated
19.0% of our net sales in the year ended December 31, 2020, with no single customer representing more than
10% of our net sales. Our top one hundred customers generated 48.3% of our net sales in the year ended
December 31, 2020. Our products serve diverse end markets, which makes our business inherently resilient. In
addition, our products are widely used in industries that are less cyclical and the end-markets for some of our
businesses, such as Medical and Liquid Technologies, are noncyclical, further enhancing our resilience. While
Europe and North America constitute 43.2% and 34.7% of our net sales in the year ended December 31, 2020,
we have also strengthened our presence in South America with our recent acquisition of Caieiras in 2018 and are
currently exploring strategic opportunities in the Decor business in China in order to benefit from market
opportunities and for purposes of managing our portfolio.

Having a diversified business model with high pass-through and internal pulp production provides stability
across macroeconomic cycles as we are cushioned from negative industry trends through our exposure to
multiple industries, which allows greater predictability of overall earnings and growth and resilience to
downturns. For example, the results of operations of each of our predecessors, Ahlstrom Corporation and
Munksjö Oyj remained largely stable during the global financial crisis that began in 2008. Similarly, our
Comparable EBITDA of €334.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 was 6.8% higher than the year
ended December 31, 2019, in spite of the global slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, though net sales
for this period decreased by 8.0% due to adverse currency effects, lower selling prices and a less favorable
product mix. While some of our businesses such as Filtration, Decor, Technical, Insulation and Precision Coating
were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, our Medical business (particularly due to increased
demand for face masks), Liquid Technologies and repurposed activities in our Filtration business, outperformed
prior periods. Diversified exposure in terms of customers, end-market and geography, with high pass-through and

internal pulp production, where net short pulp position also mitigates cyclicality, given pulp prices typically are
low when macro activity is low, also contributes to our resilience.

**_Historical high Cash conversion together with strategic deployment of capital to create future capacity_**

We have a track record of profitable growth and free cash flow generation. Our Comparable EBITDA for
the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 was €277.7 million, €312.9 million and €334.2 million,
respectively. Our Free cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 was €205 million,
€225 million, and €254 million, respectively, and our Cash conversion during the same period was 74%, 72%
and 76%, respectively. During the same period, our Capital expenditures were €160.1 million, €161.1 million and
€117.5 million, respectively, our Capital expenditures to net sales ratio was 7%, 6% and 4%, respectively, and
net cash from operating activities was €91.6 million, €286.7 million and €255.1 million, respectively. We believe
that this level of capital expenditure is higher than our long-term Maintenance capital expenditure, which
management estimates to be approximately 3% of net sales per annum, and reflects a temporary, elevated level of
capital expenditures targeting growth in order to better position us to capture further market share. Since 2017,
we have been progressing with our €200 million strategic investment program, which includes investments in
13 projects, aimed at allowing us to increase and improve our production capabilities and providing us with an
opportunity to grow, while retaining attractive cash flows. Of these 13 projects, 11 have been completed, while
the remaining are scheduled to be completed during 2021 and 2022.

A significant proportion of our Capital expenditures in 2018 and 2019 were related to projects undertaken in
the Filtration business in Madisonville, United States, the Abrasive business in Arches, France, the Parchment
business in San Severin, France, and the Coated Specialties business in Jacareí, Brazil, and a boiler and pulp line
rebuild in our plant in Billingsfors, Sweden, part of the Insulation business. Given these significant investments
in increasing capacity and improving manufacturing capabilities, we believe our production facilities are
relatively well-invested and that we are well-positioned to support future growth. We estimate that our
Maintenance capital expenditure is approximately 3% of our net sales, and we estimate that approximately
€90 million of annual capital expenditures (including IT spending) are required to maintain the competitiveness
of our current portfolio which supports our product capability.

**_Significant Transformation Opportunity Leveraging Bain Capital’s Experience from its portfolio company,_**
**_Fedrigoni_**

Bain Capital has a strong track record of driving cost savings and improvements in margin, while at the
same time growing its portfolio companies both organically and through targeted acquisitions. Bain Capital is the
majority shareholder of Fedrigoni, a leading European manufacturer and distributor of pressure sensitive labels
and luxury papers, demonstrating extensive and relevant experience of achieving operational improvements in
the same sector similar to the planned strategies for the Group. Since Fedrigoni’s acquisition by Bain Capital,
Fedrigoni’s sales growth have accelerated, and adjusted EBITDA has doubled, with a focus on increasing organic
growth, successfully integrating a number of bolt-on acquisitions, as well as driving significant operating
improvements through pricing, procurement and operating efficiencies. Fedrigoni has also improved their passthrough of cost of raw materials through pricing optimization. Through competitive sourcing, volumes
optimization and reallocation, volumes planning, supplier cooperation, as well as contract optimization,
Fedrigoni achieved meaningful savings on procurement spend. In addition, through value engineering and recipe
optimization, overall equipment effectiveness debottlenecking, maintenance, repair and operations optimization
and energy efficiency, Fedrigoni achieved meaningful savings on direct costs baseline. Based on Bain Capital’s
tested playbook from Fedrigoni, our Sponsors have identified over €200 million of profit improvement
opportunities and we expect to action approximately €30 million of such opportunities in the next 18 months.

**_Experienced management team with proven execution capabilities supported by our Sponsors_**

We benefit from the industry expertise and know-how of our experienced senior management team, which
has an average of 20 years of experience across the fiber-based materials and forestry industries and provides
leadership across our business areas. Our management team is led by Hans Sohlström, our president and chief
executive officer, who has more than 30 years of experience in the industry, and Sakari Ahdekivi, our deputy
chief executive officer and chief financial officer, who has held senior finance roles in several major companies

across a variety of industries. They are supported by our heads of function and our heads of each business area.
Most of our heads of business have had a significant period of association with their business area, including in
their previous roles at Ahlstrom, Munksjö and Expera Specialty Solutions.

Our management team has been instrumental in our growth since the merger of Ahlstrom and Munksjö and
has played a key role in creating efficiencies and a common global culture that fosters cross-business
collaboration. In addition, they have helped us to realize meaningful synergies from acquisitions, including, in
particular, the acquisitions of Caieiras and Expera Specialty Solutions, and they have successfully implemented
global cost saving programs.

We also benefit from the market expertise, business relationships, knowledge and experience of our new
Sponsors. Bain Capital is an active sponsor, both in the broader industrial space, as well as in chemicals,
industrial transformational processes and directly or indirectly, paper and fiber-based materials. Bain Capital has
a strong track record of driving cost savings and improvements in margin, while at the same time growing its
portfolio companies both organically and through targeted acquisitions.

**Our Strategies**

We and the Sponsors have developed the following strategies:

**_Invest for long-term growth across the business_**

We operate in attractive niche specialty markets and our businesses are well-positioned to capture growth in
their respective markets. All of our sixteen businesses hold leading positions in their strategic segments, with a
majority holding positions as global leaders, while others hold positions as regional leaders. The average market
growth rates of many of the underlying market segments we operate in are growing at or above underlying GDP
rates prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and we expect these markets to continue to grow in the medium-to longterm. We plan to build on this position and capture further market share and to accelerate our growth. We invest
in innovation and product development and we operate extensive research and development capabilities in each
business area. Since 2017, we have been progressing with our €200 million strategic investment program, which
includes investments in 13 projects, aimed at allowing us to increase and improve our production capabilities and
providing us with an opportunity to grow, while retaining attractive cash flows. We plan to continue to drive
growth through selected investments where necessary in our businesses or regions in which we see profitable
growth opportunities.

**_Increase focus on environmental and sustainable specialty materials in line with customer preferences_**

The specialty, high-performance market is growing in line with the increasing customer focus on health,
safety and sustainability with an expected annual growth of approximately two to five percent. Increased
customer focus on environmental and sustainability concerns is causing a significant shift in the preferences for
specialty materials across applications and end uses and continues to drive growth. We believe that we can
significantly benefit from this trend in the mid-term, given our focus on specialty fiber-based materials and our
existing portfolio of sustainable, plastic-free and circular economy focused products. Our new product
development is focused on products that make a positive contribution to sustainability. We will continue to
develop sustainable products focused on moving towards alternatives to traditional plastics. We plan to capitalize
on these opportunities and emphasize the position of our business as an environmental and sustainable leader in
our market segments.

**_Focus on profitability and opportunities to drive further margin improvements_**

We believe there is a significant opportunity to increase profitability by driving further margin
improvements. Prior to the Transactions, we focused on increasing margins and improving overall profitability
with a €50 million savings program targeting variable cost reduction through procurement savings and other
improvement actions, which was completed ahead of schedule and exceeded targets. The Sponsors intend to
continue and expand upon the implementation of certain of our cost savings initiatives from which we expect to
derive significant cost savings and improve our margins. Bain Capital is the majority shareholder of Fedrigoni, a
leading European manufacturer and distributor of pressure sensitive labels and luxury papers. Based on Bain
Capital’s tested playbook for the specialty materials market, as evidenced by the increase in sales and


9


-----

improvements in the pass-through of cost of raw materials by Bain Capital’s portfolio company, Fedrigoni, we
see significant opportunity to further increase the profitability of the business, through areas such as
procurement, pricing, operational efficiency and general cost optimization. In addition to management’s cost
savings program, our Sponsors have identified over €200 million of profit improvement opportunities and we
expect to action approximately €30 million of such opportunities in the next 18 months. See “—Summary
_Consolidated Financial and Other Information—As Adjusted Data of the Issuer.”_

**_Portfolio management through selective acquisition, divestment and other investment opportunities_**

We will continue to consider selective acquisition and divestment opportunities on an on-going basis as they
arise in order to manage our portfolio to focus on enhancing our profitability. As part of our long-term
investment strategy, we continually evaluate potential acquisitions to grow our business in the market segments
we operate, capture market share and accelerate growth. For example, we are currently exploring opportunities to
acquire or invest in Minglian, a Chinese company comprising a greenfield decor paper plant in the city of
Xingtai, Hebei Province, China in order to increase our presence in China, which is the largest decor market. In
addition, we are actively considering strategic alternatives in relation to our entire Decor paper business,
including any potential ownership in Minglian, where one of the options being investigated is the possibility of a
divestment of the Decor business. Our mid-term objective is to refocus the business on higher value segments,
and increase presence in areas where we hold stronger, more differentiated positions.

**The Transactions**

**_The Acquisitions_**

_The Tender Offer_

On September 24, 2020, the Issuer and Ahlstrom-Munksjö entered into the Combination Agreement,
pursuant to which the Issuer announced a voluntary public cash tender offer with an offer price of €18.10 in cash
for each share validly tendered (the “Initially Announced Offer Price”) for all of the issued and outstanding
shares in Ahlstrom-Munksjö that are not held by Ahlstrom-Munksjö and its subsidiaries (the “Company Shares”
and the offer, the “Tender Offer”). The completion of the Tender Offer was subject to satisfaction of certain
conditions, including acceptance of the Tender Offer by shareholders holding more than 90% (on a fully diluted
basis) of the Company Shares and voting rights carried by the Company Shares, calculated in accordance with
applicable Finnish laws governing the right to commence compulsory squeeze-out proceedings (the “Minimum
Acceptance Condition”), together with any Company Shares otherwise held by the Issuer prior to the date of the
announcement of the final result of the Tender Offer. The Board of Directors of Ahlstrom-Munksjö, represented
by a quorum comprising the non-conflicted members of the Board of Directors, unanimously recommended that
the shareholders of Ahlstrom-Munksjö accept the Tender Offer. The Initially Announced Offer Price was
subsequently adjusted first to €17.97 per share and then to €17.84 per share (the “Tender Offer Price”) in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer, to account for two payments of dividend by the
Board of Directors of Ahlstrom-Munksjö after the Tender Offer was announced.

On January 15, 2021, the preliminary results of the Tender Offer were announced. The 50,386,853
Company Shares tendered in the Tender Offer, together with the total of 345,524 Company Shares acquired by
the Issuer through market purchases and the Company Shares which were to be received by Ahlstrom Invest
from the internal reorganization involving certain Ahlström family members and certain related entities and
which Ahlstrom Invest B.V. had undertaken to tender into the Tender Offer, represented approximately 81.1% of
all the Company Shares and voting rights carried by the Company Shares in Ahlstrom-Munksjö. On January 18,
2021, the Issuer announced that on the basis of the preliminary results of the Tender Offer, it decided to waive
the Minimum Acceptance Condition and complete the Tender Offer in accordance with its terms and conditions
provided that the final result of the Tender Offer confirmed that the Tender Offer had been validly accepted by
shareholders holding at least 75% (on a fully diluted basis) of the Company Shares and voting rights carried by
the Company Shares, calculated in accordance with Chapter 18, Section 1 of the Finnish Companies Act.

When the final result of the initial offer period under the Tender Offer was published on January 20, 2021,
the Company Shares validly tendered and accepted in the Tender Offer (including the Company Shares received
by Ahlstrom Invest B.V. as a result of the internal reorganization involving certain Ahlström family members
and certain related entities), together with the Company Shares acquired by the Issuer through market purchases,
represented approximately 81.0 % of all the Company Shares and voting rights carried by the Company Shares.
As such, the Issuer announced that it would complete the Tender Offer as the Minimum Acceptance Condition
had been waived and all other conditions to completion were fulfilled. The Issuer also announced that it would
commence a subsequent offer period in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer (the
“Subsequent Offer Period”) in order to provide the remaining shareholders of Ahlstrom-Munksjö the opportunity
to accept the Tender Offer. On February 9, the Issuer announced the final result of the Subsequent Offer Period,
pursuant to which the Company Shares validly tendered and accepted during the Subsequent Offer Period,
together with the Company Shares validly tendered and accepted during the initial offer period (as extended) and
otherwise acquired by the Issuer through market purchases until February 8, 2021, represented approximately
90.6 per cent of all the Company Shares and voting rights carried by the Company Shares.

On February 4, 2021 (the “Initial Settlement Date”), the first settlement under the Tender Offer occurred
with respect to Company Shares registered with Euroclear Finland Oy and on February 5, 2021 with respect to
Company Shares registered with Euroclear Sweden AB, and the Issuer acquired approximately 81.0% of the
Company Shares. On February 10, 2021 (the “Second Settlement Date”), the second settlement under the Tender
Offer occurred with respect to Company Shares registered with Euroclear Finland Oy and on February 11, 2021
with respect to Company Shares registered with Euroclear Sweden AB, and the Issuer acquired an additional
9.6% of the Company Shares. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Issuer owned approximately
90.6% of the Company Shares.

_The Squeeze-Out_

Under Chapter 18, Section 1 of the Finnish Companies Act, a shareholder holding more than nine-tenths of
the total number of shares and voting rights in a limited liability company has the right to redeem and, subject to
a demand by other shareholders, is also obligated to redeem the shares owned by the other shareholders in a
company at a fair price. The shares held by the company or its subsidiaries are not taken into account when
calculating the aggregate number of the shares and voting rights for the purposes of said Section.

The Issuer has on February 11, 2021 notified Ahlstrom-Munksjö of its decision to exercise its redemption
right pursuant to the Finnish Companies Act and to redeem all the Company Shares held by any other remaining
shareholders in Ahlstrom-Munksjö. To implement the redemption of the remaining Company Shares, the Issuer
has filed an application to initiate arbitration proceedings as provided in the Finnish Companies Act. In the
redemption proceedings, the Issuer will seek a redemption price of €17.84 per Share for the remaining Company
Shares, which corresponds to the Tender Offer Price. The arbitral tribunal will determine the timing of the
redemption proceedings and eventually decide on the redemption price payable by the Issuer for the remaining
Company Shares. The Issuer intends to apply for the delisting of the Company Shares from Nasdaq Helsinki Ltd
and Nasdaq Stockholm AB as soon as permitted and reasonably practicable under applicable laws and
regulations and the rules of said stock exchanges.

Following the completion of the Squeeze-Out, we may undertake certain reorganizations of members of the
Group located in Sweden, France or Italy.

_Sources and Uses for the Acquisitions_

The funding sources for the Acquisitions (excluding the Squeeze-Out), the repayment or refinancing of the
Existing Senior Unsecured Notes, the Hybrid Bond and certain existing bank loans or other debt (excluding the
Pension Loan, local lines, leases and other debt and bank loans being rolled over), the dividend held at the Issuer
in respect of the Pref Instrument, the payment of related fees and expenses and other costs related to the
Transactions consist of proceeds from the following sources:

   - equity contributions from the Sponsors in the form of subscription to ordinary equity shares equaling
approximately €1,120.9 million contributed to the Issuer through intermediate holding companies (the
“Equity Contributions”) and the dividend on open market purchases;

   - drawings under the Senior Term Facilities in an aggregate amount of up to €650.0 million (equivalent)
and drawings under the Bridge Facilities that will be refinanced using the proceeds from the offering of
the Notes (see “—The Refinancing” below);

   - cash on hand and dividends paid on the shares acquired through open market purchases after the tender
offer was announced.

The notional sources and uses necessary to consummate the Acquisitions (excluding the Squeeze-Out), to
repay or refinance the Existing Senior Unsecured Notes, the Hybrid Bond and certain existing bank loans or
other debt (excluding the Pension Loan, local lines, leases and other debt and bank loans being rolled over) and
for the other uses in connection with the Transactions as described above are shown in the table below. Both the
funding sources described above and the sources and uses shown below gives effect to the refinancing of the debt
that is expected to be refinanced in connection with the Transactions and the Hybrid Bond, but does not give
effect to the Squeeze-Out. See “Capitalization” and “Description of Other Indebtedness—Existing Debt.” Actual
amounts will vary from the notional amounts presented here depending on several factors, including, among
others, those described above, the respective dates of redemption or repayment of the Bridge Facilities, the other
existing debt expected to be refinanced in connection with the Transactions or the Hybrid Bond and differences
from our estimates of fees and expenses.

equivalent), of which $363,702,000 was drawn as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement also provides for the Revolving Credit Facility in an amount of €325 million (equivalent). See “Capitalization.”

(4) Represents cash on the balance sheet used or expected to be used in connection with the Transactions and the dividends on Company
Shares purchased by the Issuer or its affiliates on the open market paid on October 9, 2020 and January 11, 2021.

(5) Represents the amount of Existing Senior Unsecured Notes, the Hybrid Bond and certain existing bank loans (excluding any accrued
interest, break costs and other fees and refinancing costs) expected to be repaid or refinanced in connection with the Transactions and
excluding the Pension Loan, local lines, leases and other bank loans being rolled over. See “Capitalization” and “Description of Other
_Indebtedness—Existing Debt.”_

(6) Represents the aggregate purchase price of the Company Shares acquired by the Issuer as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. As
of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Issuer has acquired 90.6%, of the Company Shares. The Issuer has filed an application to
initiate arbitration proceedings as provided in the Finnish Companies Act, upon the completion of which, it will own 100.0% of the
Company Shares. These proceedings typically take approximately eight to twelve months to complete but advance title to the minority
shares may, subject to the discretion of the arbitral tribunal, under the proceedings often be obtained in approximately four to six months
against the placing of a security. While the Issuer has initiated the proceedings on the basis of the Tender Offer Price, the price of the
Company Shares acquired in the Squeeze-Out could be in excess of the Tender Offer Price. The price of the Company Shares to be paid
in connection with the Squeeze-Out will be funded using sources of cash available to the Issuer at such time. See “Summary—The
_Transactions—The Acquisitions—The Squeeze-Out.”_

(7) Represents amounts deposited into the escrow account for the purposes of making payments on the Pref Equity instrument.

(8) Represents cash overfunding in connection with the transaction and includes approximately €29.6 million of cash and cash equivalents
required to be held in Brazil, South Korea, China, India and Indonesia.

(9) Represents estimated fees and expenses associated with the Transaction, including commitment, underwriting, arranging, placement,
original issue discount, financial advisory, legal, accounting, ratings advisory and other transaction costs and professional fees. These
fees and expenses have been estimated as of the date of this Offering Memorandum and are subject to change. Additional fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the Refinancing are not included. See “—The Refinancing” and “Use of Proceeds.”

_The Refinancing_

In connection with the Acquisitions, the Issuer entered into the Bridge Facilities Agreements, which provide
for the EUR Bridge Facility in an aggregate principal amount of €600,000,000 and the USD Bridge Facility in an
aggregate principal amount of $484,936,000. The Issuer used, or will use, the proceeds from the Bridge
Facilities, the Equity Contributions from the Sponsors and drawings under the Senior Term Facilities, to finance
its acquisition of the Company Shares offered pursuant to the Tender Offer, to prepay or redeem the Existing
Senior Unsecured Notes, the Hybrid Bond and certain existing bank loans (excluding the Pension Loan, local
lines, leases and other bank loans being rolled over), to pay certain costs and expenses and for the other uses as
described under “—The Acquisitions—Sources and Uses for the Acquisitions.”

The proceeds from the Offering, together with a portion of the proceeds from the Senior Term Facilities and
cash on hand, will be used by the Issuer to refinance the indebtedness outstanding under the Bridge Facilities
and, in particular:

   - approximately €274.6 million for the purposes of refinancing the proceeds of the Bridge Facilities
utilized to pay the purchase price of €1,859.6 of the Company Shares that have been acquired by the
Issuer as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, representing approximately 90.6% of the Company
Shares, (ii) pay costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Acquisitions and the other
transactions as described above, including legal, accounting, ratings advisory and other transaction
costs and professional fees, and (iii) pay costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
Offering representing all the proceeds from Tranche A (as defined below) under the Notes; and

-----

   - approximately €375.4 million for the purposes of refinancing proceeds of the Bridge Facilities utilized
for the purposes of the repayment or refinancing of certain existing debt of the Group, representing all
the proceeds from Tranche B (as defined below) under the Notes.

For the avoidance of doubt, the “virtual tranching” of the Notes is aimed at identifying the separate portions
of the proceeds from the Offering to be used by the Issuer to refinance the proceeds under the Bridge Facilities
utilized for (i) payment of the purchase price of the Company Shares, (ii) payment of costs, fees and expenses
related to the Transactions and (iii) refinancing of repayment or refinancing certain existing debt of the Group
and will not entail issuing separate identifiers (ISINs or Common Codes) for each such virtual tranche under the
Notes. See “—The Acquisitions—Sources and Uses for the Acquisitions” and “Use of Proceeds.”

The estimated sources and uses necessary to consummate the Refinancing are shown in the table below.
Actual amounts will vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including the amount of interest
expense on the Bridge Facilities and differences from our estimates of fees and expenses. We present certain
amounts below translated to euros. You should not view such translations as representation that such euro
amounts actually represent such U.S. dollar amounts, or could be or could have been converted into U.S. dollars
at the rate indicated or at any other rate, on the Initial Settlement Date, the Issue Date or any other date. This
table should be read in conjunction with “Capitalization.”

(1) Represents the euro-equivalent amount of the expected proceeds of the offering of Notes hereby (assuming an issue price of par for both
series of Notes).

(2) Represents a portion of the gross proceeds from the Senior Term Facilities. The Senior Term Facilities include the euro-denominated
EUR TLB Facility in an initial principal amount of €550,000,000, of which €350,000,000 was drawn as of the date of this Offering
Memorandum, and the U.S. dollar-denominated USD TLB Facility in an initial principal amount of $547,000,000 (€450,000,000
equivalent), of which $363,702,000 was drawn as of the date of this Offering Memorandum.

(3) Represents the euro-equivalent aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Bridge Facilities as of the date of this Offering
Memorandum translated at an exchange rate of $1.21234/€1.00 and excludes approximately €6.5 million (equivalent) of accrued and
unpaid interest to, but excluding, the assumed date of repayment. The Bridge Facilities will be repaid in full on the Issue Date with the
proceeds from the Offering and cash on hand at the Issuer. As a result of such repayment, proceeds from a portion of the Notes
designated as Tranche A, equal to an aggregate principal amount of approximately €274.6 million (equivalent) will be used to:
(i) refinance the proceeds of the Bridge Facilities utilized for the acquisition of the Company Shares, (ii) refinance costs, fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the Acquisitions and the other transactions as described above, including legal, accounting, ratings
advisory and other transaction costs and professional fees, and (iii) pay the costs, fees, and expenses incurred in connection with the
Offering as described below in footnote (3) (“Tranche A”), and proceeds from a separate portion of the Notes designated as Tranche B,
equal to an aggregate principal amount of approximately €375.4 million (equivalent) will be used to refinance the proceeds of the Bridge
Facilities utilized to repay or refinance certain existing debt of the Group plus any break costs (“Tranche B”). Break costs are included in
the amount of transaction and other costs under “—The Acquisitions—Sources and Uses for the Acquisitions” above. For more
information on the Italian law considerations applicable to Tranche A and Tranche B and the related limitations on guarantees and
security interests granted by Italian companies, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure—Limitations to the
_Guarantees and Collateral,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws,_

_of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and_
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests—Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees and Security_
_Interests Under Italian Law.” See also “—The Acquisitions—Sources and Uses for the Acquisitions.”_

(4) Represents estimated fees and expenses associated with the Refinancing, including underwriting, placement, legal and other transaction
costs and professional fees to be financed with cash and/or a portion of the proceeds from virtual Tranche A under the Notes. See “—The
_Acquisitions—Sources and Uses for the Acquisitions.” These fees and expenses have been estimated as of the date of this Offering_
Memorandum and are subject to change. Refinancing costs exclude (i) accrued but unpaid interest on the Bridge Facilities, additional
expenses in connection with Transactions other than the Refinancing that were paid by the Issuer and Ahlstrom-Munksjo¨ as described
under “—The Acquisitions—Sources and Uses for the Acquisitions” and (iii) any post-closing costs or expenses.

**Recent Developments**

**_Response to COVID-19_**

On January 23, 2020, we initiated a centralized crisis alert team to carry out a global pandemic contingency
and preparedness response plan. We established a COVID-19 Safety Protocol to ensure safe operations and
customer service. Our manufacturing plants are maintaining a cohesive set of rules to keep operations running
and employees safe. Local adjustments are made according to country-level or local health and safety regulation
and guidance.

Our 45 plants and converting sites in 14 countries remained operational during 2020 and have continued to
remain operational in the first months of 2021, except for a few temporary shutdowns caused by government
lockdowns or employee absences related to quarantine or infections. Production has not been interrupted to any
significant extent due to raw material supply issues.

The impact of the pandemic on customer activity has varied. Since the first quarter of 2020, we have
experienced strong demand in the healthcare and life science end-use segments. Demand for solutions for
personal protection equipment such as face masks, drape and gown materials, as well as diagnostics materials for
rapid test kits and venting filters for devices used in the treatment of patients with respiratory disorders was
strong in 2020. The exceptional circumstances, with regional lockdowns and limited mobility for citizens, also
increased demand for packaging-related release liner and packaging tape applications. In the second quarter of
2020, demand for home building and furniture, transportation and industrial end-uses decreased due to a large
portion of the global population being in lockdown. In the third quarter of 2020, demand recovered for home
building and furniture, driven mainly by increased household furniture spending, as well as transportation end
uses. Towards the end of 2020, demand for industrial-related products improved. Overall demand for consumer
goods related applications, of which food and beverage and packaging represent the largest share, remained
relatively stable during 2020, but varied somewhat, depending on end use. The resurgence of the COVID-19
pandemic in the fourth quarter of 2020 caused many countries to reimpose restrictions, but these lighter and more
regional lockdowns did not have a material impact on demand in the fourth quarter of 2020.

The COVID-19 pandemic has created an exceptional situation globally and a strong demand for healthcare
goods in general, and particularly for protective medical products made from our fabrics. We have long been an
established manufacturer of nonwoven fabrics, which are used to construct protective medical fabrics such as
surgical gowns and drapes, pleated surgical face masks, protective apparel and sterile barrier systems. We have
produced the inner and outer coverstock used for pleated surgical face masks, and have recently begun to
produce the middle filter media. Thanks to our in-depth knowledge of filtration materials and common
manufacturing platform, we were able to respond swiftly to growing demand by expanding manufacturing of
face mask fabrics to lines normally used for producing other fiber-based materials. Our offering included a full
range of protective face mask fabrics for civil, surgical and respiratory masks. This allowed us to fill production
capacity for filtration materials that would have otherwise remained unused, in particular during the second and
third quarters of 2020. During the second half of 2020, our delivery volumes of face mask fabrics gradually
decreased as production and export of face masks in China resumed and global availability and price competition
increased. We also expanded our manufacturing capacity for face masks at several of our facilities.

The financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on us was relatively limited in 2020. We incurred some
additional costs as a result of increased health and safety measures, securing the functionality of our operations
through increased logistics and overtime spend, shutdowns and servicing additional demand. We also
experienced a negative impact on net sales compared to 2019 driven primarily by adverse currency effects, lower
selling prices and a less favorable product mix, including due to COVID-19. While some of our business areas
experienced lower sales volumes, our Group-wide volumes were only slightly lower as a result of increased
demand, in Medical, for face mask materials, and, in Liquid Technologies, for rapid test kits and face masks. In
addition, we took numerous actions across the organization to cushion the short-term financial impact of the
expected decline in delivery volumes and to support our liquidity position, including the implementation of
temporary layoffs, reduction of working hours and the minimization of the use of external personnel and
services. We also reduced spending and postponed certain projects. Members of the Executive Management
Team and the CEO took a 50% and 100% reduction, respectively, on one month’s salary during the second
quarter of 2020. The Board of Directors also decided to forgo their compensation for one month in the second
quarter. Savings from these actions were approximately €24 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. As a
result, we estimate that the COVID-19 pandemic had a net negative impact of approximately €26 million on
Comparable EBITDA. See also “—Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information—As Adjusted Data
_of the Issuer.”_

customary exclusions, materiality thresholds and exceptions),

in each case, where to do so would not have a material adverse
effect on their ability to conduct their business and operations, as
determined by each such Post Squeeze-Out Guarantor in its sole
and absolute discretion (the “Post Squeeze-Out Collateral” and,
together with the Issue Date Collateral, the “Collateral”).

Subject to and in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, the
Collateral will also secure the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The
security interests may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain
defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability. In addition, the
security interests in the Collateral may be released under certain
circumstances. Subject to the provisions of Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Collateral may be pledged to secure future

indebtedness. For more information on the security interests granted, see
“Description of the Notes—Security” and for more information on
potential limitations to the security interests, see “Certain Insolvency
_Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability_
_of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests” and “Risk Factors—_
_Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure.”_

Use of Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The proceeds from the Offering of the Notes, together with a portion of
the proceeds from the Senior Term Facilities and cash, will be: (i) used
to refinance the indebtedness outstanding under the Bridge Facilities;
and (ii) used to pay the costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection
with the Offering, including financial advisory, legal, accounting, ratings
advisory and other transaction costs and professional fees. See “Use of
_Proceeds.”_

Additional Amounts . . . . . . . . . . . Any payments made by the Issuer or any Guarantor with respect to the
Notes or Note Guarantees will be made without withholding or
deduction for taxes unless required by law. If such withholding or
deduction is required by law in any “relevant taxing jurisdiction,” the
Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as applicable, will pay the additional
amounts necessary so that the net amounts received after the withholding
or deduction is not less than the amount that would have been received
in the absence of the withholding or deduction, subject to certain
exceptions. See “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes.”

Optional Redemption . . . . . . . . . . The Issuer may redeem all or part of each series of Notes on or after
, 2024, at the redemption prices set forth under “Description
_of the Notes—Optional Redemption,” plus accrued and unpaid interest_
and additional amounts, if any, to the date of redemption.

Prior to, 2024, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions
redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of each series of
Notes originally issued under the Indenture (including the original
principal amount of any additional Notes), using the net proceeds from
certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to % of the
principal amount of the Notes so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable
date of redemption; provided that at least 50% of the aggregate principal
amount of the applicable series of Notes (excluding any additional Notes)
remains outstanding after each such redemption.

Prior to, 2024, the Issuer may redeem up to 10% of the
aggregate principal amount of each series of Notes originally issued
(including the aggregate principal amount of any additional Notes
issued) in each calendar year, commencing on the Issue Date, at a
redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount thereof, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, up to the
redemption date. See “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.”

In addition, prior to, 2024, the Issuer may redeem all or,
from time to time, part of each series of Notes at a redemption price
equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus the applicable
“make-whole” premium described in this Offering Memorandum and
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but not
including, the applicable date of redemption.

Optional Redemption for
taxreasons . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . In the event of certain developments affecting taxation that become
effective on or after the Issue Date, the Issuer may redeem the applicable
series of Notes in whole but not in part, at any time, upon giving written
notice, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and additional amounts, if any, to,


21

but excluding, the date of redemption. See “Description of the Notes—
_Redemption for Taxation Reasons.”_

Change of Control . . . . . . . . . . . . Upon the occurrence of certain change of control events, the Issuer will
be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a purchase
price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and
unpaid interest to the date of the purchase. A change of control, however,
will not be deemed to have occurred if a specified consolidated total net
leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such event. See
“Description of the Notes—Change of Control.”

Certain Tender Offers . . . . . . . . . . In connection with certain tender offers for the Notes, if holders of not
less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable series of
outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such
tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer
in lieu of the Issuer, purchases, all of the applicable series of Notes
validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such
third party will have the right to redeem the Notes that remain
outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price
equal to the price offered to each other holder of Notes. See “Description
_of the Notes—Optional Redemption.”_

Certain Covenants . . . . . . . . . . . . The Indenture will limit, among other things, the ability of the Issuer and
(as applicable) its subsidiaries to:

                        - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain
preferred stock;

                        - pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock;

                        - make certain restricted payments;

                        - make certain investments;

                        - create or permit to exist certain liens;

                        - impose restrictions on the ability of their subsidiaries to pay
dividends or make other payments to the Issuer;

                        - merge or consolidate with other entities, or make certain asset sales;

                        - enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and

                        - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the
Notes.

Each of the covenants in the Indenture will be subject to significant
exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the Notes—Certain
_Covenants.” Certain of the covenants and events of default will be_
suspended if and for as long as, and the security interests in respect of
the Collateral will be released if, we achieve investment grade ratings.
See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of
_Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status.”_

U.S. Federal Income Tax
Considerations . . . . . . . . . . . . . For a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations of an
investment in the Notes, see “Certain Taxation Considerations—Certain
_U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.” You should consult your own_
tax advisor to determine the U.S. federal, state, local and other tax
consequences of an investment in the Notes.

Transfer Restrictions . . . . . . . . . . The Notes and the Guarantees have not been registered under the
Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and will not
be so registered. The Notes are subject to restrictions on transferability
and resale. See “Notice to Investors.” Holders of the Notes will not have
the benefit of any exchange or registration rights.

No Prior Market . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Notes will be new securities for which there is no market. Although
the Initial Purchasers have informed us that they intend to make a market
in the Notes, they are not obligated to do so, and they may discontinue
market making at any time without notice. Accordingly, we cannot
assure you that an active trading market for the Notes will develop or be
maintained.

Listing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Application will be made to list the Notes on the Official List of the
Exchange. There can be no assurance, however, that the Notes will be
listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that such admission to trading
in the Notes will be granted or that such listing will be maintained. The
Exchange is not a regulated market pursuant to the provisions of
Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments, as amended.

Risk Factors . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Investing in the Notes involves substantial risks. You should consider

particular, you should evaluate the specific risk factors set forth in the
“Risk Factors” section before making a decision whether to invest in the
Notes.

Governing Law . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Indenture will be governed by
New York law. The Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities will be governed by English law. Each Transaction

**SUMMARY CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

_The Issuer was formed for the purposes of facilitating the Transactions. The Issuer does not have any_
_business operations, material assets or liabilities other than those incurred in connection with its incorporation_
_and the Transactions. We do not present in this Offering Memorandum any financial information or financial_
_statements of the Issuer for the periods presented, other than certain limited financial data presented on an as_
_adjusted basis to reflect the Transactions and the Offering._

_The following tables set forth certain of Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s historical consolidated financial and other_
_information. Our summary historical consolidated financial and other information set forth below as of and for_
_the financial years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 has been derived from the Financial Statements_
_included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. Such historical consolidated financial and other information_
_has been prepared in accordance with IFRS. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information.”_

_On January 1, 2020, we changed the presentation format for our income statement to present it based on_
_function of expense, instead of nature of expense and to align with our internal reporting. As of January 1, 2020,_
_our income statement is presented according to the function of expense method. The comparative income_
_statement information for the year ended December 31, 2019 in the 2020 Financial Statements has been restated_
_according to the function of expense method to facilitate comparability and is unaudited. In the 2019 Financial_
_Statements and the 2018 Financial Statements the income statement was presented using the nature of expense_
_method. In connection with the adoption of the function of expense method, certain minor reclassifications and_
_changes in names of income statement items have been made in the 2020 Financial Statements. Due to these_
_reclassifications net sales for the year ended December 2019 decreased by €1.0 million. Certain income_
_statement line items were also renamed in the 2020 Financial Statements. For example, net profit was renamed_
_to net result, and profit before tax was renamed to result before tax. In order to aid comparability, financial_
_information from the year ended December 31, 2019 is presented on an audited historical basis when comparing_
_to the financial information for the year ended December 31, 2018, and, otherwise, is extracted without_
_adjustment from the unaudited, restated comparative column included in the 2020 Financial Statements. See_
_“Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Ahlstrom-Munksjo¨—Comparability of the Financial_
_Statements—Presentation of Income Statement.”_

_We decided to implement a new business structure, which became effective on January 1, 2020, to promote_
_core business capabilities and sharpen strategic targets and align the business characteristics of each business_
_area. For periods after January 1, 2020, our five business areas comprise Filtration & Performance Solutions,_
_Advance Solutions, Industrial Solutions, Food Packaging & Technical Solutions, and Decor Solutions, which_
_also form our operating and reporting segments. For periods prior to January 1, 2020, our five business areas_
_comprised Filtration & Performance Solutions, Industrial Solutions, Decor, Specialties, and North American_
_Specialty Solutions. In the 2020 Financial Statements, we have restated our presentation of the financial_
_information of our business areas for the comparative year ended December 31, 2019 to reflect our new business_
_structure and the restated business area financial information is unaudited. However, no business area financial_
_information for any prior period has been restated and the business area financial information for the year ended_
_December 31, 2018 is presented based our previous business areas and is not comparable to the business area_
_information presented in the 2020 Financial Statements. In order to provide meaningful comparable information_
_in this Offering Memorandum, we present the financial information for the business areas for the year ended_
_December 31, 2019 based on the prior business areas when comparing to the financial information for the year_
_ended December 31, 2018, and, otherwise, based on the new business areas. See “Presentation of Financial and_
_Other Information—Ahlstrom-Munksjo¨—Comparability of the Financial Statements—Changes to Reportable_
_Segments.” The business areas’ performance is assessed internally on the basis of net sales and Comparable_
_EBITDA. Comparable EBITDA is defined for internal management reporting purposes as EBITDA excluding_
_items affecting comparability in EBITDA, such as material items outside the ordinary course of business, such as_
_gains and losses on business disposals, direct transaction costs related to business acquisitions, costs for closure_
_of business operations and restructurings including redundancy payments, one-off items arising from purchase_
_price allocation such as inventory fair value adjustments, compensation related to environmental damages_
_arising from unexpected or rare events and other items, including fines (such as VAT tax audit fines) or other_
_similar stipulated payments and litigation, but excluding impairment losses in each case, as further described_
_under “—As Adjusted Data of the Issuer.”_

_For the year ended December 31, 2018 and following the acquisitions of Expera Specialty Solutions and_
_Caieiras, each business area’s performance was assessed internally on the basis of its net sales and Comparable_


24


-----

_EBITDA, in each case pro forma for the acquisitions of Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras. Net sales, pro_
_forma for the acquisitions of Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras, is defined for internal management_
_reporting purposes as net sales giving pro forma effect to the net sales impact of the acquisitions of Expera_
_Specialty Solutions and Caieiras. Comparable EBITDA pro forma for the acquisitions of Expera Specialty_
_Solutions and Caieiras is defined for internal reporting purposes as EBITDA excluding certain items affecting_
_comparability and giving pro forma effect to the acquisitions of Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras. The pro_
_forma impact of the acquisitions of Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras on net sales and Comparable_
_EBITDA for internal management reporting purposes is presented as if Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras_
_had been consolidated to full-year results for the year ended December 31, 2018._

_We acquired Expera Specialty Solutions, a U.S. based specialty paper producer, on October 10, 2018 and_
_Caieiras, a specialty paper mill in Brazil, on October 17, 2018. Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras were_
_consolidated into our historical consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. The_
_income statement or statement of cash flows for any period prior to such dates do not include the impact of such_
_acquisitions. As a result, given the magnitude of the acquisitions of Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras, the_
_historical income statement and cash flow information for 2018 is not comparable to such information for any_
_subsequent period. Certain business area information for the year ended December 31, 2018 is presented on a_
_comparable basis to such information for the year ended December 31, 2019. See “Presentation of Financial and_
_Other_ _Information—Ahlstrom-Munksjö—Comparability_ _of_ _the_ _Financial_ _Statements—Acquisitions_ _and_
_Disposals—Acquisitions of Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras” and “Management’s Discussion and_
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for further information._

_The summary standalone and consolidated financial and other information below includes certain non-IFRS_
_measures that we use to evaluate our economic and financial performance. These measures are not identified as_
_accounting measures under IFRS and therefore should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the_
_equivalent measures calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS or those calculated using financial_
_measures that are prepared in accordance with IFRS. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—_
_Non-IFRS Financial Measures.”_

_We have also presented below unaudited as adjusted data of the Issuer, which gives effect to the_
_Transactions, including the Acquisitions, the Offering, and the drawings under the Senior Term Facilities, as set_
_forth in “—The Transactions,” as if the Transactions had occurred on (i) January 1, 2020, for the purposes of as_
_adjusted income statement items for the year ended December 31, 2020 and (ii) December 31, 2020 for the_
_purposes of as adjusted balance sheet items. See “Capitalization.” The as adjusted financial information of the_
_Issuer as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and_
_does not represent what our indebtedness or interest expense would have been had the Transactions occurred on_
_December 31, 2020, or January 1, 2020, respectively, nor does it purport to project our indebtedness or interest_
_expense at any future date. The as adjusted financial information of the Issuer as of and for the year ended_
_December 31, 2020 has not been prepared in accordance with IFRS, the requirements of Regulation S-X under_
_the Securities Act, the Prospectus Regulation or any generally accepted accounting standards. Neither the_
_assumptions underlying the adjustments nor the resulting as adjusted financial information as of and for the year_
_ended December 31, 2020, have been audited, verified or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted_
_auditing standards._

_You should read the information set forth below in conjunction with the sections “Presentation of Financial_
_and Other Information,” “Use of Proceeds,” “Capitalization,” “Selected Historical Financial Information” and_
_“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the_
_consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. Our_
_historical results do not necessarily indicate results that may be expected for any future period._

- On January 1, 2020, we changed the presentation format for our income statement to present it based on function of expense, instead of
nature of expense and to align with our internal reporting. In connection with the adoption of the function of expense method, certain
minor reclassifications of income statement items have been made, resulting in a decrease in net sales of €1.0 million and an increase in
other operating income of €8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. For more information on changes in income statement
presentation, see “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—The Issuer—Comparability of the Financial Statements—
_Presentation of Income Statement.”_

** We adopted IFRS 16 (Leases) as of January 1, 2019, using the simplified approach. Figures for the periods prior to January 1, 2019 have
not been restated and, therefore, are not fully comparable. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Ahlstrom-Munksjo¨—
_Comparability of the Financial Statements—Changes to Accounting Standards—IFRS 16.”_

*** In October 2018, we acquired Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras. Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras were consolidated into
our historical consolidated financial statements as of their respective acquisition dates. As a result, financial and other information for the
year ended December 31, 2018 is not directly comparable with financial and other information for subsequent periods. See “Presentation
_of Financial and Other Information—Ahlstrom-Munksjo¨—Comparability of the Financial Statements—Acquisitions and Disposals—_
_Acquisitions of Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras.”_

+ We adopted IFRS 16 (Leases) as of January 1, 2019, using the simplified approach. The figures for the periods prior to January 1, 2019
were not restated and, therefore, are not fully comparable. The new standard resulted in the recognition of the majority of our leases on
the balance sheet and therefore our assets and liabilities have increased. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—
_Ahlstrom-Munksjo¨—Comparability of the Financial Statements—Changes to Accounting Standards—IFRS 16.”_

++ In 2019, Ahlstrom-Munksjö changed the classification of certain balance sheet items between interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing
liabilities. The comparative information as of December 31, 2018 has been restated accordingly. The restatement as of December 31,
2018 from current borrowings to trade and other payables amounted to €8.8 million. In 2019, lease liabilities were also reclassified from
borrowings to a separate line item, and lease liabilities as of December 31, 2018 were restated accordingly. The lease liabilities as of
December 31, 2018 relate to finance leases in accordance with previously used IAS 17 (Leases) and the related interpretations, which
were replaced by IFRS 16 as of January 1, 2019. The restated information is unaudited.

(a) The implementation of the IFRS 16 standard on January 1, 2019 had a positive impact of €16.3 million on EBITDA for the year
ended December 31, 2019, as the formal rental charges are reflected in depreciation and interest expense under IFRS 16, and the
comparative figures for the year ended December 31, 2018 were not restated. See “Presentation of Financial and Other
_Information—The Issuer—Comparability of the Financial Statements—Changes to Accounting Standards—IFRS 16.”_

(b) Figures for the year ended December 31, 2018 have not been restated to give effect to the impact of the acquisitions of Expera
Specialty Solutions and Caieiras, which occurred on October 10, 2018 and October 17, 2018, respectively. As a result, such
information is not directly comparable to figures for any subsequent period. See “Presentation of Financial and Other
_Information—The Issuer—Comparability of the Financial Statements—Acquisitions and Disposals—Acquisitions of Expera_
_Specialty Solutions and Caieiras.”_

(c) Operating result includes historical impairment losses amounting to €9.2 million, €2.4 million and €7.7 million for the years ended
December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

(d) Represents costs incurred in relation to certain business acquisitions and other transactions, including the acquisitions of Expera
Specialty Solutions and Caieiras in October 2018 and the Tender Offer.

(e) Represents costs incurred in relation to the integration of Ahlstrom Corporation and Munksjö Oyj after the completion of their
merger in 2017 and integration costs related to acquisitions of Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras in October 2018.

(f) Represents inventory fair value adjustments arising from purchase price allocation related to acquisitions of Expera Specialty
Solutions and Caieiras in October 2018.

(g) Represents costs for closure of business operations and restructurings including redundancy payments.

(h) Represents costs related to environmental provisions relating to a closed site in Italy.

(i) Represents net gains and losses incurred in relation to the disposal of shares in certain Group companies, businesses and equity
investees. Net gain incurred in 2020 relates mainly to the sale of the fine arts paper business in Arches, France in 2020.

(j) Represents other items including fines (such as VAT tax audit fines) or other similar stipulated payments and litigations.

(k) Includes an adjustment of €4.4 million related to profit-sharing plan that distributes employees a share of the gain of the sale of the
fine arts paper business in Arches, France in 2020, an adjustment of €(0.3) million related to the release of a restructuring provision,
an adjustment of €(0.3) million related to non-operational gains on sales of fixed assets, an adjustment of €(2.0) million income on a
straight line basis related to energy subsidies received from the French government in relation to a carbon dioxide tax for energy
intensive industries, an adjustment of €0.6 million related to the removal of past services costs and settlements related to benefits
changes and settlements in Korea, France and Germany, and an adjustment of €(0.9) million related to other smaller divestments
during the year ended December 30, 2020.

(l) Represents the impact of initiatives implemented by Ahlstrom-Munksjö in the second half of 2020 applied to expected volumes in
2021. These initiatives primarily include procurement savings of approximately €7.1 million, including indirect procurement
savings of approximately €2.5 million driven primarily by actions addressing logistics and packaging, and savings related to
purchases of chemicals of €2.2 million.


31


-----

(n) Represents expected savings from projects completed in 2020 aimed at increasing efficiency levels and reducing waste by
improving energy and raw material consumption. The majority of savings are from a rebuilt recovery boiler in Billingsfors of
approximately €2.7 million and a metering project to improve efficiency in Jacareí, Brazil of approximately €2.3 million.

(n) Represents the estimated run-rate increase in EBITDA after giving effect to savings that we expect to realize by the end of 2021
through a number of initiatives focused on improving efficiency and management of raw material costs by renegotiating supplier
contracts in November and December 2020, which have resulted in more favorable rebate structures and rate cards. Savings of
€10.4 million are attributable to fibers, €2.5 million to chemicals, €2.5 to indirect costs, €0.6 million to energy and €0.4 million to
wood based on achieving budget volumes in 2021. These savings do not include any amounts driven by fluctuations in market
prices.

(o) Represents the estimated run-rate increase in EBITDA after giving effect to certain additional profit improvement opportunities
identified by the Sponsors and expected to occur in the first 18 months following the Acquisitions. Approximately €200 million of
opportunities (less a contingency of approximately €50 million) have been identified, including (i) approximately €84 million of
opportunities related to additional procurement as a result of centralizing the procurement function, better managing demand and
improving cross-plant optimization, (ii) approximately €68 million of operations improvements focused on reducing certain
production-related costs, (iii) approximately €34 million of pricing benefits realized as a result of better monitoring and managing
raw materials pass-through and (iv) approximately €15 million selling, general and administrative costs. The adjustment of
€30 million relates to procurement and certain selling, general and administrative costs initiatives that the Sponsors believe to be
actionable quickly and excludes pricing improvement or other initiatives that would require more time or effort to implement.

(p) Represents the normalization for the net impact of the COVID-19 pandemic primarily in the first half of 2020, including
(i) additional costs incurred as a result of health and safety measures, securing functioning operations (including logistics and
overtime), shutdowns and servicing additional demand and (ii) a negative impact on net sales compared to 2019, driven primarily by
adverse currency effects, lower selling prices and a less favorable product mix, including due to COVID-19. Our business areas
experienced slightly lower sales volumes overall, though there was increased demand, in Medical, for face mask materials, and, in
Liquid Technologies, for rapid test kits and face masks. This negative impact was partially offset by temporary cost mitigation
actions, including temporary lay-offs and decreases in travel expenses. See “—Recent Developments—Response to COVID-19.”

(q) As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Issuer owns approximately 90.6% of the Company Shares. To implement the
redemption of the remaining Company Shares, the Issuer has filed an application to initiate arbitration proceedings as provided in
the Finnish Companies Act. See “Summary—The Transactions—The Acquisitions—he Squeeze-Out.”

(5) Comparable EBITDA Margin represents Comparable EBITDA divided by net sales.

(6) Capital expenditure includes purchases for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, as presented in the Summary
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement. We estimate our Maintenance capital expenditure as approximately 3% of our net sales, and we
estimate that approximately €90 million of our annual capital expenditures (including IT spending) are required to maintain the
competitiveness of our current portfolio which supports our product capability.

(7) Operating working capital represents inventories plus operative receivables before factoring less operating payables. The breakdown of
operating working capital for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 was as follows:

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information contained in_
_this Offering Memorandum, you should carefully consider the following risk factors before purchasing the Notes._
_The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that the Group faces. Additional risks and_
_uncertainties that we are not aware of or that the we currently believe are immaterial could also have a material_
_adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, competitive position and_
_prospects. If any of the possible events described below occurs, our business, financial condition, results of_
_operations, cash flows, competitive position and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. If that_
_happens, the Issuer may not be able to pay interest or principal on the Notes when due and you could lose all or_
_part of your investment._

_This Offering Memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties._
_Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of_
_various factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._

**Risks Related to Our Operating Environment**

**_Uncertain global economic and financial market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our_**
**_business, financial condition and results of operations._**

The general economic and financial market conditions in Europe and other parts of the world have
undergone significant volatility in recent years. We are especially exposed to the macroeconomic conditions
affecting Europe and North America, which accounted for 43.2% and 34.7%, respectively, of our total net sales
for the year ended December 31, 2020. Since early 2020, the primary factor in increased uncertainty globally
from an economic and social perspective has been the global outbreak of COVID-19 (the “COVID-19
pandemic”). The resulting broader economic downturn and slowing global economic growth has increased the
risk of weakened demand for a wide range of our products.

The COVID-19 pandemic may result, and in many jurisdictions has already resulted, in restrictions such as
limitations on travel and transportation of goods, closure of businesses and public offices, quarantines and
general lockdowns, the duration of which are uncertain. This has resulted, and may continue to result, in
materially increased volatility and declines in financial markets and weaker demand in the global economy.
Furthermore, such measures implemented, or intended to be implemented, by governments or governmental
bodies could have a material adverse effect on supply chains and generally impact business operations across the
economy both as a result of weakened economic activity and in terms of the health and wellbeing of employees
being affected. Several central banks and governments have announced and employed financial stimulus
packages in anticipation of a significant negative impact on gross domestic product. However, there is no
certainty that these policy tools will counter anticipated macroeconomic risks. This has resulted, and may
continue to result, in materially increased volatility and declines in financial markets and weaker demand in the
global economy.

Furthermore, global economic conditions have been, and are likely to continue to be, affected by concerns
over increased geopolitical tensions as well as political developments, such as the United Kingdom’s decision to
leave the European Union (“Brexit”) on January 31, 2020, and the threat of escalated trade disputes on a global
level. See “—The result of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative
_effect on our business.” In addition, developing markets, such as South America, are generally subject to greater_
political, economic and social uncertainties than countries with more developed institutional structures, and the
risk of losses resulting from changes in law, authorities’ practices and interpretations, economic or social
upheaval and other factors may be substantial. These or other geopolitical tensions, political developments
around the world and a global trend toward protectionism have affected the global economic conditions and
increased market uncertainty and volatility and may continue to do so in the future.

It is difficult to predict how market conditions will develop, as they are impacted by macro movements of
the financial markets and many other factors, including the stock, bond and derivatives markets as well as
measures taken by various governmental and regulatory authorities and central banks, over which we have no
control. Uncertainty remains in the global markets and the global economy could experience another recession,
or a depression, which could be more prolonged or have a greater financial impact than the global recessions that
began in 2008.

Our business is affected by the trends in global investment activities and cyclical fluctuations in our
customers’ end-use segments. The uncertainty in the global economy and financial markets may diminish

33


-----

customers’ ability or willingness to make investments, as a result of which order decisions may be postponed or
cancelled, which could decrease our sales and impair our profitability. In addition, uncertainty in the global
economy and financial markets may have a negative effect on the availability and cost of financing. Our liquidity
and access to financing may be materially affected by changing conditions in the financial markets, or our capital
resources may not, at all times, be sufficient or readily available to satisfy our liquidity needs. We may not
necessarily be able to utilize the opportunities arising from the economic fluctuations or to adapt to a long-term
recession or stagnation of the economy. The materialization of any of the above risks could have a material
adverse effect on our profitability, future cost of debt and access to bank and capital market financing in the
future, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_Demand for our products may be affected by, among other factors, the cyclical nature of the industry in which_**
**_we operate and changing market conditions._**

Our products are generally affected by the cyclical nature of our industry in terms of selling prices, raw
material prices and delivery volumes, and the cycles may vary in different customer industries and in geographic
regions. Demand for our products is affected by global, regional and national macroeconomic conditions that
affect end-users of our products. Accordingly, we are also exposed to cyclical changes in the various industries in
which our customers operate, such as everyday consumables, health care and life science, homebuilding and
furniture as well as transportation and industrial end-use segments.

The cyclical nature of the fiber-based solutions and products industry may result in overcapacity and
consequently put pressure on the pricing of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our
profitability. In the absence of sufficient economic growth, periods of local excess supply may decrease the
demand for our products and lead to decreases in market selling prices. Demand for our products could also
decline due to various other factors in our operating environment, some of which are discussed elsewhere in
these “Risk Factors.”

Shifts in the patterns of demand, whether foreseen or not, could also strain the flexibility of our asset base
and leave some assets underutilized, while others may become overloaded. See also “—Risks Related to Our
_Business and Operations—Our production operations involve operational risks, and failures or deficiencies in_
_the management of operational efficiency could have a material adverse effect on us” below._

Any decreases or changes in the patterns of demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We operate in highly competitive markets, which could negatively impact our results of operations and_**
**_financial condition._**

The segments for fiber-based solutions and products in which we operate are highly competitive, and we
compete with multinational corporations, regional manufacturers and specialized manufacturers. Certain of our
products are priced in a competitive market environment at prevailing market prices, which may result in small
margins. The competitive environment has tightened in some of our product segments, particularly for release
liner and coated one-sided segment used for flexible packaging in Europe, filter materials in North America and
in export markets for decor papers outside of Europe. Some of our competitors may be able to take advantage of
stronger economies of scale benefits due to larger sites, higher investment capacity or other operational benefits,
such as ability to utilize integrated pulp at their sites.

In addition, existing or new competitors may enter one or more of our key markets, or they may seek to
increase their market share through aggressive pricing strategies or otherwise. Existing or new competitors may
begin to manufacture products that compete with certain of our products, by adapting their existing production
capacity or by investing in new capacity. If this were to occur to any significant degree, decreased prices for
those products would likely follow, thus adversely affecting the profitability of our business. The COVID-19
pandemic may also accelerate the decline in the consumption of printing and writing paper and may trigger the
conversion of paper machines to production of products in segments other than printing and writing paper in
which we are operating. Furthermore, our products may face competition from alternative materials, such as
petroleum-based materials including plastics. If the use of other products and materials in certain applications
increases at the expense of fiber-based solutions and products, there is a risk that demand for our products will
decrease. The electrification of mobility is picking up momentum and impacts one of our larger customer
segments, the transportation industry, which may negatively impact demand for our combustion engine filtration
products. Although this impact may be offset by new solutions that are being developed where new types of

34


-----

filters are needed for applications such as battery cooling and air filtration, there can be no assurance that we will
benefit from such trends.

In addition, we may be subject to long-term adverse trends in demand for paper. For example, use of fine
paper has declined since the 1990s and conversion has increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. See also
“—Risks Related to Our Business and Operations—We may not be successful in product development and
_innovation or in development of our production processes to keep pace with competitors, or we may be forced to_
_make further investments due to technological developments in the industry” below._

Failure to adapt to industry trends, sustain the investments necessary to compete effectively, properly
manage our response to increased competition, or otherwise compete effectively, may have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Changes in the costs or availability of raw materials and energy could have a material adverse effect on our_**
**_business and profitability._**

Our primary raw materials are wood, pulp, wood necessary to produce pulp, renewable annual fibers,
various synthetic fibers, including glass, and plastic, as well as chemicals, including titanium dioxide, and
energy. Our cost base is primarily variable, with variable costs, such as fibers, other raw materials and energy,
constituting 65% of our total costs for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our commodity pulp consumption was
approximately 1,200 thousand tons for the year ended December 31, 2020. Volatility, price increase and the
availability of raw material, particularly of pulp, impact our margin on variable costs and results. Our pulp
exposure was reduced by approximately 500 thousand tons of our own pulp production during the year ended
December 31, 2020, which includes 185 thousand tons of market pulp production at our Aspa pulp mill in
Sweden that is sold to third parties. The price and availability of raw materials and energy may fluctuate
significantly depending on a variety of factors, including business cycles in the relevant markets, supply
conditions, government regulations, natural disasters and other factors that are difficult to predict and beyond our
control. While raw material costs, particularly for pulp and titanium dioxide, have decreased in 2019 and 2020,
any substantial increases in the cost of pulp, energy or other raw materials that we use could have a material
adverse effect on our results. In addition, decreasing raw material prices may also put additional pricing pressure
on some of our products as customers may expect decreased raw materials costs to be passed through to them.

The level of raw materials production capacity is also a key factor that impacts price and availability of raw
materials. Global overproduction of raw materials generally decreases the price and increases the availability of
raw materials, whereas underproduction generally decreases the availability of raw materials in the market,
which may result in a price increase. Natural disasters or issues with our supply agreements could also cause the
prices of raw materials or energy to increase. Price increases in raw materials, energy and services, such as
transportation, that cannot be offset by corresponding price increases of our products and solutions could impact
our margins and profitability, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations. Our ability to pass price increases to our customers through increases in the
prices of our products is dependent on several factors, including demand and the negotiation power of our major
suppliers and customers.

While we have generally been able to pass through increases in the costs of raw materials and energy to our
customers, our ability to continue doing so depends on several external factors, such as demand for our products
and the negotiation power of our major suppliers and customers. As a result, we may not be able to reliably pass
through increases in the costs of raw materials and energy to our customers. Furthermore, we may experience
significant time delays in passing through these price increases for various reasons, including limits in
contractual provisions or competitive pressures.

In the event of a significant increase in the price, or a significant disruption in the supply, of raw materials
or energy, we may have to purchase raw materials or energy from alternate sources, which could significantly
impact our ability to provide competitively priced products to our customers in a timely manner. Furthermore,
while we are not dependent on any specific supplier, certain major suppliers to an individual business may be
costly or difficult to replace, particularly if there are supply shortages. If any of the above factors were to
materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Trade restrictions, such as tariffs, and economic sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our_**
**_business, financial condition and results of operations and our reputation._**

We operate in a large number of countries, some of which are or have been the subject of export controls
and economic sanctions, such as Russia, Armenia, Bosnia, Egypt, Lebanon, Moldova, Serbia, Tunisia, Ukraine

35


-----

and Venezuela. Our purchases of raw material and/or sale of products have in the past, and may in the future,
become subject to new or tightened export control regulations, sanctions, tariffs, embargoes or other economic
and trade restrictions in the future, and such measures could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Authorities in the countries in which we operate or from which we import our products may impose new
custom duties to imports, or repeal current ones, which could have a material adverse effect on the supply of
products or their prices. Changes in the level of custom duties may have a material adverse effect on our ability
to import our products or the profitability of our domestic operations in markets where such protectionist
measures are applied.

The global nature of our business operations subjects us to sanctions and regulations imposed by a multitude
of jurisdictions. For example, we must comply with laws and sanctions regulations of the United States, the
European Union and the United Nations. International economic and trade sanctions are complex and subject to
frequent change, including in relation to jurisdictional reach and to the list of countries, entities and individuals
subject to sanctions. While we regularly monitor the situation, ensuring compliance with such controls and
regulations may be difficult or costly and there is a risk that it could become subject to investigations or claims
by authorities or contracting parties. Although we have trade compliance procedures and controls in place, there
can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be effective or that we will not be deemed to be
engaged in dealings with entities or individuals subject to sanctions through our operations. New or possible
further trade restrictions, protectionist measures, sanctions or economic slowdown resulting from increased
economic or political instability in certain regions could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
Materialization of any of the above risks, including any actual or perceived violations of, or non-compliance
with, such trade restrictions or economic sanctions, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation,
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Political, financial or legal risks in emerging markets could have a material adverse effect on us._**

We have operations around the world, including in a number of emerging markets, in particular in Asia and
South America. Emerging markets are generally subject to political, economic and social uncertainties, and the
risk of losses resulting from changes in law, authorities’ practices and interpretations, economic or social
upheaval and other factors may be substantial. Among the more significant risks of operating and investing in
emerging markets are those arising from the introduction of trade restrictions, enforcement of foreign exchange
restrictions, inflation and changes in tax laws and enforcement mechanisms. Operations in certain emerging
market countries may also include the risk of the possibility of expropriation or nationalization of assets.
Materialization of any of the above risks could substantially reduce or eliminate any benefits derived from
operating in these markets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

**_The result of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative effect on our_**
**_business._**

On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom held an in or out referendum on the United Kingdom’s membership
of the European Union, the result of which favored the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union. On
January 31, 2020, Brexit became effective and the United Kingdom entered into a transition period during which
the European Union and the United Kingdom acted as if the United Kingdom was a member of the European
Union (the “Transition Period”). Following the expiry of the Transition Period, the United Kingdom ceased to be
treated as a member of European Union on December 31, 2020. Although on December 24, 2020 the United
Kingdom and the European Union agreed to a trade agreement (the “Trade and Cooperation Agreement”), there
are still a number of areas of uncertainty in connection with the future of the United Kingdom and its relationship
with the European Union and the application and interpretation of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, and
Brexit-related matters may take several years to be clarified and resolved. The United Kingdom may still face
barriers to trade and commerce with the European Union and may still lose its present rights to the global trade
deals negotiated by the European Union on behalf of its members, which may in turn diminish overall economic
activity between the United Kingdom and the European Union and the United Kingdom and its global trade
partners. Given this uncertainty and the range of possible outcomes, it is currently impossible to determine the
impact that Brexit, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement and the nature and extent of responses by the United
Kingdom in the formulation of fiscal and monetary policies and any related matters may have on general
economic conditions in the United Kingdom. It is also not possible to determine the impact that these matters
will have on our business.

Although we have made preparations to ensure business continuity, there can be no assurance that our
suppliers’ and customers’ current business operations will not be impacted by Brexit, or that the consequences of
Brexit on the European Union’s border with the United Kingdom will not affect supplies to us or lead times of
deliveries. In addition, the Scottish regional government is actively considering a second referendum on Scottish
independence from the United Kingdom, which may lead to additional uncertainty and may affect our business
activities in Scotland and other parts of the United Kingdom. The above-mentioned and similar events could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**Risks Related to Our Business and Operations**

**_We may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy and subsequently manage our growth_**
**_effectively_**

Our growth depends on the successful implementation of our business strategy. Our ability to implement our
business strategy is subject to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, but not
limited to, our ability to:

   - focus on profitability and opportunities to drive further margin improvements;

   - increase our focus on environmental and sustainable specialty materials in line with customer
preferences;

   - invest for long-term growth across the business; and

   - manage our portfolio through selective acquisition and divestment opportunities.

Adverse developments in general economic conditions could also adversely affect our ability to successfully
implement our business strategy. Any failure to successfully execute our business strategy could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may not be successful in product development and innovation or in development of our production_**
**_processes to keep pace with competitors, or we may be forced to make further investments due to technological_**
**_developments in the industry._**

Our market position is dependent on a combination of regular product and technology development and
long-term customer relationships. Our ability to grow and to maintain our competitiveness depends on our
continued ability to identify and respond to changes in consumer and industry preferences and demand, develop
our production and launch new and improved products in a timely manner using our existing or new production
capabilities in all of our key markets and manufacture and market our products in changing markets. In addition,
our production chains are fairly complex, which may cause additional challenges in responding to specific
customer and industry needs. The speed with which new products are rolled out to the market is essential for our
continued competitiveness. We may not be successful in launching new products on time or as expected during
the planning and development process as the commercialization process may require a considerable amount of
time.

Our business operations depend on our ability to foresee commercial and technological developments in our
key markets, and to implement such developments. If we are unable to effectively foresee or implement such
developments, a competitor rather than us may benefit from such developments. We may be required to make
large investments to acquire such developments, or may be unable to acquire such developments, which could, in
turn, affect our ability to compete with our competitors. For example, while we are currently exploring
opportunities for new applications to be used in electric vehicles, changes in the use of electric vehicles may
occur more rapidly than expected or the market for electric vehicles could stagnate. There can be no certainty
that we will be able to foresee future developments in a timely manner or future developments may require
significant additional investments to remain competitive in the sector.

There can be no assurance that we will be successful in continuing to meet our customers’ needs through
innovation or in developing new products or technologies, or that, if developed, any such new products or
technologies will meet the needs of our customers. We may not be able to recover investments that we have
made in order to develop these new products or technologies, and may not have sufficient resources to keep pace
with technological developments. Our failure to keep pace with evolving technological innovations in our
markets and adequately foresee customer preferences could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted consumers’ lives across the world. The length of the pandemic will
likely be a key determinant for if and how markets and customers’ behavior patterns will permanently change
and what effect these changes will have on future business opportunities for companies, including us.

**_The fiber-based solutions and products industry is characterized by significant capital expenditure in the_**
**_production processes and maintenance of existing production and converting facilities and the failure or delay_**
**_of any current or upcoming investment of a significant size may have a material adverse effect on us._**

The fiber-based solutions and products industry is characterized by significant capital expenditure in the
production processes and maintenance of existing production and converting facilities. In recent years, we have
undertaken certain investments in order to improve product capability, the efficiency of our production processes
and to increase capacity. In 2019 and 2020, we have, among other things, completed the rebuild of the recovery
boiler and debottlenecking of the pulp line in Billingsfors, Sweden, the bailing line modernization at the Aspa
pulp plant in Sweden, the production line upgrade of decor paper in Dettingen, Germany, the expansion of
coating capabilities in Jacareí, Brazil, a rebuild of our converting line of sterilization wrap at our Pont-Audemer
plant in France and the installation of a new cogeneration plant at our site in Turin, Italy. In addition, in 2018, we
announced an investment of approximately €28 million to strengthen our manufacturing platform for high
performance filtration and energy storage applications. This project, which is expected to be completed during
the second half of 2021, consists of a significant expansion of our micro glass capacity and a further growth in
our industrial filtration capacity in Turin, Italy, Fabriano, Italy, Malmedy, Belgium and Binzhou, China. In 2018,
we also announced an investment currently expected to be approximately €37 million in a second-hand Voith
production line that will produce tea bag and coffee pod materials at our Chirnside plant in the UK, has partially
been delayed and has incurred additional costs in an amount of €9 million. The deviation in the capital
expenditure spending and timeline is a result of the complexity of the project, reduction in capital expenditure
plans in 2019 which placed the project on hold, as well as the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, we
announced an investment of €7 million related to a new coating machine to enable formaldehyde-free balancing
and finish foils for furniture and the building and construction industries. The investment will also help reduce
carbon dioxide emissions and increase production capacity. The coating machine is expected to be completed in
the fourth quarter of 2021. We have also acquired several new production facilities as a result of our corporate
acquisitions and there can be no certainty as to the need for capital expenditure and maintenance investments
relating to equipment, machinery and other assets of the newly acquired production facilities or in any future
corporate acquisitions.

The investments we undertake may not be completed in the expected timeframe or at all, may experience
budget overruns or may not result in the benefits that we expect, and the newly acquired production facilities
may be subject to significant unexpected capital expenditure and maintenance costs. The materialization of any
of the above risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_We are subject to risks in relation to acquisitions and other investments._**

We have grown through a combination of organic development and acquisitions, and we expect to continue
to grow through selected acquisitions or investments that add geographical scope, new technologies or customer
segments. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates in the future and even if
we identify a suitable acquisition or investment candidate, we may not be able to finance such acquisition on
favorable terms, if at all. We acquired Expera Specialty Solutions, a U.S. based specialty paper producer (the
“Expera Acquisition”), and Caieiras in Brazil (the “Caieiras Acquisition”) in 2018. In 2019, we achieved the
targeted cost synergy run rate of €21 million from the acquisition of Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras,
exceeding the initial target of €14 million and actions implemented during 2020, which were delayed due to the
COVID-19 related lockdowns and travel restrictions, generated a further €2 million of synergies. We expect to
generate additional business synergies of at least €8 million from the Expera Acquisition, with a gradual impact
from 2021 onwards.

We are also exploring options to acquire or invest in Minglian, a Chinese company comprising a greenfield
decor paper plant in the city of Xingtai, Hebei Province, China. The COVID-19 pandemic-related lockdowns and
travel restrictions have delayed the negotiation and signing of the transaction, which could happen as early as
during the first half of 2021. See also “—Problems associated with any reorganization of our operations or
_divestments of businesses could have a material adverse effect on us.”_

Achieving the remaining or the anticipated benefits of the Expera Acquisition and other corporate
acquisitions or investments largely depends on timely and efficient integration of their business operations,

38


-----

processes and ways of working with us, which, in turn, are also dependent on the management’s time and
resources available to the acquired entities. There can be no assurance that we will achieve such remaining or
anticipated benefits in the expected timeframe or at all. We may also encounter difficulties in integrating
acquisitions or investments with our operations, applying our internal controls processes to these acquisitions or
in managing strategic investments.

Acquisitions are also subject to a number of risks related to the assessment of the acquired business or other
investments, including its value, strengths, weaknesses, potential profitability, assets and liabilities. Diligence
reviews of acquisition or investment targets may not identify all of the material issues necessary to accurately
estimate the cost or potential loss contingencies with respect to a particular transaction, including potential
exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target’s previous activities. Even a detailed review
of the acquired entity may fail to identify and discover potential liabilities and deficiencies, including legal
claims, claims for breach of contract, employment related claims, tax liabilities and other liabilities (whether or
not contingent), which could result in significant future additional costs and liabilities. Furthermore, indemnities
and other contractual protections in the acquisition or investment documentation may not protect us against all or
part of every known liability or deficiency, and may incur unanticipated costs or expenses in connection with
such transactions, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating
duplicate facilities, litigation and other liabilities, including related to warranties. Target companies may be
located in countries in which the underlying legal, economic, political and cultural conditions do not correspond
to those customary in our key areas of activity or have other national peculiarities with which it is not familiar. In
addition, any future acquisitions or investments may be subject to regulatory approvals by competent national
and supra-national authorities, including competition authorities, which we may be unable to obtain without
unreasonable expense or delay, if at all. We may not realize the targets for growth, economies of scale, cost
savings, development, production and distribution, or other strategic goals that we seek from the relevant
acquisition or investment to the extent or in the timeframe anticipated, and the attention of management and other
personnel may be diverted for long periods of time. Moreover, the purchase price may prove to have been too
high or unforeseen restructuring or integration expenses may become necessary.

In addition, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or any possible future outbreaks could increase the
uncertainties regarding the execution of corporate acquisitions or other investments and the acquired companies’
planned integration with our business operations and lead to additional costs. Furthermore, the overall effects of
the COVID-19 pandemic or any possible future outbreaks of the virus on the global economy could erode the
acquired companies’ businesses or the investment opportunity in a way that unpredictably decreases their value
for us.

Our failure to integrate acquired businesses or investments, or to realize any expected synergies, may
prevent it from obtaining the advantages that the acquisitions were intended to create, and could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Problems associated with any reorganization of our operations or divestments of businesses could have a_**
**_material adverse effect on us._**

We may from time to time contemplate reorganizing certain business operations to improve our profitability
or to respond to changes in market conditions. For example, we implemented a new business and reporting
structure beginning January 1, 2020, with a view to supporting profitable growth, competitiveness as well as
customer support. In addition, we may, from time to time, divest businesses that do not meet our strategic
objectives or growth or profitability targets. For example, in 2020, we divested our fine art paper business in
Arches, France and our glass fiber reinforcement business in Mikkeli, Finland. In addition, we are actively
considering strategic alternatives in relation to our entire Decor paper business, including any potential
ownership in Minglian, where one of the options being investigated the possibility of divestment of the Decor
business. The successful execution of any reorganization plans or divestments is dependent on a number of
factors, including the correct timing and execution of the plans, co-operation of our employees and customers,
ability to maintain operational efficiency and in case of a divestment, ability to negotiate favorable terms with the
buyer.

Any reorganization of business operations may have a material adverse effect on us and may result in
customers reducing or cancelling orders or terminating their customer relationship with us entirely. Any
significant reduction in sales could lead to overcapacity, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on
our ability to utilize our production capacity efficiently or profitably. In addition, any divestment may also
subject us to surviving warranties under the applicable terms, some of which may be uncapped in time and/or

39


-----

amount. Such plans could also result in the loss of key executives or employees, may result in labor claims,
litigation or reputational harm. There can be no certainty that we would be able to achieve all of the anticipated
benefits of such plans or divestments. The estimated costs could be higher than estimated and any plan or
divestment may not be completed within the expected timeframe or at all.

The occurrence of any of such risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

**_Joint ventures and other partnerships arrangements may expose us to risks._**

From time to time we enter into joint ventures and other partnership arrangements with other parties in
relation to projects in which we have an interest. Joint ventures and partnership arrangements can often require
unanimous approval of the parties to the joint venture or partnership arrangement or their representatives for
certain fundamental decisions, which means that each party may have a veto right with respect to such decisions.
This could, in turn, lead to a deadlock in the operations of the joint venture or partnership. Further, we may be
unable to exert control over strategic decisions made in respect of such joint venture or partnership. Any failure
of such other parties to meet their obligations to us or to third parties, or any disputes with respect to the parties’
respective rights and obligations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

**_We may be unable to recruit and retain key personnel._**

We are, to a certain extent, dependent on key individuals. We operate in a technically demanding industry in
which qualified and experienced employees, particularly in research and development, provide an important
competitive advantage. We also face the risk of an aging workforce. Our ability to retain and recruit employees
who have relevant qualifications and to succeed in succession planning is important for our continued success.
Furthermore, we are subject to the risk of employees, including senior management and other key employees,
leaving due to corporate transactions, such as corporate acquisitions or divestments. If we fail to retain and
recruit key individuals or if we fail in succession planning, this could delay or impair our business and product
development, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
operations.

**_The COVID-19 pandemic and possible future outbreaks could disrupt our business operations._**

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and any possible future outbreaks could have an adverse effect on us. In
response to the outbreak, we have initiated a centralized crisis alert team to carry out a global pandemic
contingency and preparedness response plan to ensure the safety of our employees worldwide. Our 45 plants and
converting sites in 14 countries have remained operational during 2020, except for a few temporary shutdowns
caused by government lockdowns or employee absences due to quarantine or infections. Raw material supply
issues have not caused any significant interruptions of production. Our investment project in a second-hand Voith
production line that will produce biodegradable and compostable tea and coffee infusion materials at our
Chirnside plant in the UK, however, has partially been delayed and has incurred additional costs in an amount of
€9 million. The deviation in the capital expenditure spending and timeline is a result of the complexity of the
project, reduction in capital expenditure plans in 2019 which placed the project on hold, as well as the outbreak
of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and any possible future outbreaks of the virus among our employees, or
if employees are unable to work as a result of being quarantined, may have an adverse effect on our operations
and could lead to significant interruptions of production. In addition, the current pandemic or any possible future
outbreaks of the virus could have an adverse effect on our suppliers, distributors, logistics and other supply chain
operations, resulting in a deficit of supplies necessary to carry out our operations, and therefore possibly
disrupting output deliveries to customers. Although we have taken measures to decrease operational risks arisen
due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there can be no assurance that the chosen measures will be effective, especially
if the COVID-19 pandemic persists for a long period.

Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic or any possible future outbreaks or COVID-19, including any new
variants thereof, or of other viruses could negatively affect the demand of our products. For example, the
exceptional circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, with regional lockdowns and limited mobility for
citizens, have resulted in lower restaurant traffic, which has slowed demand for food processing and packaging
products. Similarly, demand for home building and furniture, transportation and industrial end-uses has
decreased. In 2020, we implemented actions, such as temporary layoffs, shorter working hours and minimizing

40


-----

the use of external personnel and services, to mitigate the financial impact of lower volumes, in particular during
the second and third quarters of 2020.

Any failure to successfully adapt our business operations or strategy to the changing operating conditions
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or any future outbreaks or materialization of any other risks mentioned
above, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may not be able to achieve the estimated benefits from the renewal of our business platform._**

On February 13, 2020, we announced a renewal of our business processes and modern systems to create a
strong foundation to operate our global business effectively and strengthen customer experience. The new,
stronger platform is intended to benefit our way of doing business by utilizing the data and the opportunities for
further digitalization. The business platform is expected to enable growth strategy implementation and generate
efficiency, agility, transparency, improve stakeholder value and contribute to profitable growth. The business
platform renewal started in 2020 with a planning phase and will be implemented over several years. Achieving
the estimated benefits of the renewal will involve certain risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance
that we will achieve the estimated benefits of the renewal within the currently estimated timeframe, or at all. In
addition, increased digitalization of our business may increase certain of the risks described in this “Risk
_Factors” section, including the risks described under “—Any significant problems with our IT systems could have_
_a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.”_

Risks and challenges relating to the renewal of the business platform include, but are not limited to, the
following:

   - introduction and implementation of a new operating model and business processes;

   - implementation of new IT technologies;

   - placement of demands on our resources to manage the process internally, which may affect the
management’s ability to run our business effectively during the renewal process; and

   - co-operation with our employees and customers.

The expected benefits from the renewal of the business platform as well as the related costs are inherently
uncertain and based on a number of our assumptions and judgments. In addition, the renewal might not be
completed in the expected timeframe. The materialization of any of the above described risks could result in us
not being able to achieve the estimated benefits from the renewal and cause additional costs to us, which could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our production operations involve operational risks, and failures or deficiencies in the management of_**
**_operational efficiency could have a material adverse effect on us._**

Our ability to utilize our production capacity efficiently could be materially affected by variations in
customer demand or interruptions in production. Any inability to adjust production capacity may lead to
opportunity loss, in the case of increasing demand, or to cost burdens, in the case of decreasing demand. Rapid
production changes may be challenging to implement, which could also increase our vulnerability to adverse
general economic and industry conditions. We typically only produce goods against orders received, rather than
for stock. However, a variety of conditions may cause customers to reduce, delay or cancel anticipated or
confirmed orders and lower capacity utilization to align the production with the demand. Any inability to
maintain operational efficiency could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

In addition, any interruption or disruption in production at our production sites, whether due to lack of
orders, labor action, environment-related accidents, breakdown of major paper, pulping or other production
machines, interruptions in the distribution of energy, system failures or service interruptions in IT systems, fire,
accidents, natural hazards, catastrophes, natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, unexpected geological or
other physical conditions, criminal or terrorist acts, pandemics, transportation disruptions, problems in our supply
agreements or other factors, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our production goals and
result in lost opportunities in the future. Any of the above may have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_Loss of significant customer relationships and customer concentration could harm our business._**

Changes in customer industries related to customer strategies or end-user needs could have a material
adverse effect on our business. We are not dependent on any specific customer or group of customers. Our ten

41


-----

largest customers generated 19.0% of our net sales in the year ended December 31, 2020 and no single customer
represented more than 10% of our net sales in same period. However, we have customers that are significant to
the operations of an individual business area. Additionally, a number of our customers are, or could in the future
be, under pressure in their own domestic markets from imports, in particular from Asia, and may consequently
lose market share or have to relocate their production or converting facilities to other markets, which could cause
our customers to reduce the volume of their purchases. The loss of a significant number of our key customers, if
not replaced with new customer agreements on similar terms, or a significant reduction in sales to any such
customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We
are also exposed to a risk of customer concentration. The industries in which our customers operate may be
subject to future consolidation. Any such consolidation could result in companies having increased bargaining
power and could lead to a decline in our market share if an existing customer merges with or is acquired by an
entity that has a strong relationship with one of our competitors.

**_We rely on certifications by industry standard-setting bodies._**

We obtain and seek to adhere to certain certifications, because we seek to conduct our activities with respect
to the environment. We incur significant costs and expenses in order to comply with and maintain our
certifications, including assessments necessary for the renewal of the certifications and monitoring and
implementation of the certifications. If we fail to maintain any of our certifications, our business may be harmed
because our customers may cease buying certain products from us, which in turn could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Any significant problems with our IT systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial_**
**_condition and results of operations._**

Our operations depend on the integrity, security and stable operation of our IT systems and software, which
are primarily provided by third-party suppliers. The operation of our IT systems and software could be
interrupted by power cuts, software or telecommunication errors or disasters such as fires or natural disasters, as
well as human errors made by our own staff or third-party suppliers. If our IT systems and software were to
become unusable or their function were to be significantly impaired for any reason during an extended period of
time due to, for example, systems and software becoming outdated or due to a lack of sufficient resources for IT
support from third-party suppliers, our operations could be adversely affected, since our production processes
and our ability to deliver products on time, order raw materials and handle inventory are largely dependent on
our IT systems and software. Difficulties in renewing, maintaining, upgrading and outsourcing our IT systems
and software could result in increased costs and damage to our reputation in the eyes of our customers and other
third parties, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations.

Despite our security measures and back-up systems, our information technology and infrastructure may be
vulnerable to attacks by hackers, computer viruses or malicious code. Various cyber threats have increased in
recent years along with the digitalization of companies’ operations. We may be targeted, for example, by
phishing or malware attacks, denial-of-service attacks, breaches in information or data systems, ransomware or
attacks targeting production processes. It may also be difficult for us to detect cyber-attacks upon their
occurrence, which could have an impact on the size of damage. In addition, our information technology and
infrastructure may be breached due to employee error, malfeasance or affected by other disruptions, including as
a result of natural disasters or telecommunications breakdowns or other reasons beyond our control. In addition,
any problems with IT systems and software could result in leakage of sensitive information and theft of
intellectual property. Any of the above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

**_Failure to establish, manage and protect intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on_**
**_our competitiveness and our business, financial condition and results of operations._**

Our success depends on being on the leading edge in terms of product development and improvement of our
manufacturing and production processes. This, in turn, depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property
rights. We have taken active measures to obtain protection of our intellectual property by obtaining patents,
trademarks and by monitoring activities in our major markets. In addition to our patent portfolio and trademarks,
we rely on trade secrets, know-how, the development of new products and technological development in
combination with non-disclosure and other agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. However, the
measures that we take to protect our intellectual property may not effectively deter competitors from improper

42


-----

use of our intellectual property. Protection of intellectual property rights may be more challenging in some of the
regions in which we operate. For example, in the past there have been attempts in China to misuse the name and
logo of Ahlstrom Corporation, one of our predecessor companies. Competitors, suppliers and customers may
misappropriate intellectual property owned or licensed by us, disputes as to ownership of intellectual property
may arise and intellectual property may otherwise become known by or independently developed by competitors,
suppliers or customers. In addition, certain technologies and processes used by us may be subject to the
intellectual property rights of third parties. Such third parties may take legal action for infringement of these
intellectual property rights and any such claim could delay or prevent the delivery of our products. We may not
be successful in defending against this or other challenges brought against our intellectual property rights, may
be required to pay royalties for the use of patents or trademarks of third parties for key technologies or may need
to make substantial investments to research and develop suitable alternatives. We, at times, rely on trade secrets
instead of other forms of protection for our patents or trademarks when patent or trademark protection is not
possible, such as, for example, when the particular technology which was used could not be exactly identified or
would not qualify for patent or trademark protection, or in our opinion would be less effective than maintaining
secrecy. In addition, we rely upon confidentiality agreements with our employees, contractors and other third
parties. To the extent that we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements, there can be no
assurance that our efforts to maintain secrecy will be successful or that third parties will not be able to develop
the product, technology or know-how independently. Any loss of secrecy could have a material adverse effect on
our financial condition and results of operations. Any failure by us to establish, manage and protect our
intellectual property or resulting claims of infringement on third-party intellectual property rights could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and our competitiveness. See
also “—We may from time to time be involved in litigation and other similar proceedings that could have a
_material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.”_

**_Compliance with environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption and other national and international laws_**
**_and regulations could increase our operating costs, and potential violations of laws and regulations could_**
**_have a material adverse effect on us._**

We and our operations are subject to various regional, national and local laws and regulations, including
environmental regulations, health and safety laws and regulations, labor regulations, competition regulations,
regulations restricting competitive trading conditions, anti-corruption laws, anti-dumping, data-protection,
corporate, tax and accounting laws. These requirements are complex and frequently change, and they have
tended to become more stringent over time. The passing of new or amended laws or regulations, could require us
to adopt more stringent standards, could restrict our operational or strategic flexibility or require significant costs
and investments. In addition, our operations are subject to different environmental permits, with which we must
comply. We will incur capital and operating costs in our efforts to comply with these laws and regulations. For
example, wastewater discharges and air emissions are highly regulated, and large investments are required to
ensure compliance with applicable requirements. There can be no assurance that the requirements of such laws
and regulations and the associated cost of compliance will not increase in the future. Adapting operations to such
changes may require us to incur costs that are difficult to anticipate, which, in turn, could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our operations in the EU are also affected by the cost of compliance with the EU Emissions Trading System
(“ETS”) in accordance with directive 2003/87/EC, as amended, establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas
emission allowance trading. If our carbon dioxide emission levels exceed the rights in our possession, we must
purchase sufficient carbon dioxide emission allowances. From 2013 onwards, manufacturing companies have
generally had to purchase a steadily increasing amount of emission rights in auctions, for which the costs for
emission allowances are difficult to foresee. The cap on total annual emissions in the EU will gradually be
reduced in phase four of the ETS starting from 2021, and auctions will become the main method for issuing
allowances. Further, regulations on chemicals, such as EU Regulation (No 1907/2006) concerning chemicals and
their safe use, aim to improve the protection of human health and the environment through a system of
registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals, and may also impose obligations and related
costs on us. For example, we use titanium dioxide as a raw material for manufacturing certain types of specialty
papers. The European Commission has approved the classification of titanium dioxide as a category 2 carcinogen
under the CLP regulation (1272/2008/EC) and the harmonized classifications will apply from September 9, 2021.
The change in the classification could impose additional obligations and costs on us and the use of titanium
dioxide in our products could generate reputational harm for us. Any of the above events could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

43


-----

Other environmental and health and safety expenditures relate to maintenance, inspection and security
requirements, contingency arrangements for emergency preparedness and insurance coverage. Industrial
operations, including our production processes are inherently fraught with risks of substantial environmental
costs and liabilities. We may be unable to predict future changes to laws, regulations and operating permits,
which may require us to incur increased operating costs and additional liabilities on us.

We are also required to comply with the provisions of anti-corruption legislation in jurisdictions in which
we operate. There can be no assurance that our current and past policies and monitoring systems have been or
will be able to detect or prevent all potential instances of illicit conduct, or that such policies have been or will be
fully and consistently applied throughout our organization. While we seek to exercise best practices in
compliance with applicable laws, there can be no assurance that our past and current policies and monitoring
systems were or are able to detect or prevent all potential instances of illicit conduct.

We have adopted data protection practices with the aim of being compliant with the General Data Protection
Regulation 2016/679 (the “GDPR”) and other applicable data protection laws and regulations applicable to our
business and operations. Compliance with the GDPR and other laws and regulations or potential inadequacy of
our data protection practices may cause problems, difficulties or additional costs for us. Any infringement of the
GDPR or any other applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect our reputation among our customers
and other stakeholders. Furthermore, data protection authorities may be vested with the power to impose
corrective actions, including temporary or definitive bans on data processing, and to impose fines for breaches of
the GDPR or other applicable laws and regulations.

If we or our employees, distributors or suppliers, violate any of the applicable laws and regulations, we
could experience increased costs or delays in the delivery of our products, be subject to fines, damages or
penalties as well as orders and sanctions imposed by supervisory authorities and courts. We may also suffer
reputational harm, which could reduce demand for our products and have a material adverse effect on our
business.

**_Our operations are exposed to risks related to human health, environment and natural resources, which may_**
**_cause it to incur additional costs and liabilities._**

The nature of our manufacturing processes and products exposes us to potential liability risks under
applicable laws and regulations relating to human health, the environment and natural resources. Health and
safety-related incidents have occurred in the past at our production sites and could occur in the future. Such
incidents could result in injury to our employees, harm to employees and disruptions in production processes,
which may result in costs and other liabilities and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations, and could damage our reputation and ability to recruit qualified employees.

Our operations result in emissions of substances in the air and water, and generate noise. Production
processes and products, which by their nature require the use of chemicals and materials that are potentially
harmful to the environment and result in the generation of waste products that require special treatment. Many of
our manufacturing facilities are situated in locations with a long history of environmentally harmful industrial
use, including the use, storage and disposal of hazardous materials. We are currently, and could in the future be,
required to investigate, remediate, monitor or otherwise pay for remediation or other clean-up measures at
locations where operations are currently pursued or where they have been pursued in the past, and such payments
may be material. Such liability for costs might also arise with respect to real estate property that we own, have
previously owned or where predecessor companies previously had operations, or in connection with a closure of
a production facility. Even where liability is the result of predecessor actions, these costs may not be adequately
covered by predecessors or we may be liable for such costs in the future even after a production facility is closed
or sold. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we made environmental provisions of €15.8 million. There can
be no guarantee that our environmental provisions will be sufficient to cover any environmental liabilities that we
may incur.

Our product development and manufacturing processes involve the use of chemicals, such as organic
solvents and other mineral additives, and other hazardous materials. Our operations also result in emissions of
substances in the air and generate noise. These programs and processes expose us to risks of accidental
contamination, such as accidental discharge of untreated water used in the production process, events of
non-compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulatory enforcement, personal injury,
property damage and claims and litigation resulting from such events.

Any environmental accident or finding, employee injury, occupational disease or other health and safety
issue could impose significant liabilities and remedial costs on us as well as result in reputational damage. In

addition, individuals (employees as well as third parties) could seek damages for alleged personal injury or
property damage due to accidents or exposure to chemicals, materials or substances that are currently used or
were used in the past by us or that are present at facilities operated by us. The Rottersac and Arches production
sites in France have been designated as sites where employees have been in contact with asbestos from 1956 to
1997 and from 1960 to 1992, respectively. As a result of potential exposure to asbestos, employees employed at
the Rottersac and Arches production sites during these periods are entitled to or have already opted for early
retirement. In addition, we are aware of a number of cases where individual employees and/or their beneficiaries
have presented asbestos indemnification claims for their illness, alleged loss of salary, anxiety suffering
(préjudice d’anxiété) and difficult living conditions (trouble dans les conditions d’existence). While we sold our
fine arts paper business which was housed by the Arches production site, to Italy-based F.I.L.A. Group in the
first quarter of 2020, we continue to remain liable for these claims under the terms of the sale. Although we do
not believe that these claims will have a material effect on our financial condition, there can be no assurance that
further claims will not be made against us. While we have an outstanding provision of €1.5 million as of
December 31, 2020 to cover outstanding asbestos-related claims by employees, there can be no guarantee that
such claims will not increase or that new claims will not be brought in the future. We may face other asbestosrelated liabilities as asbestos has been identified in materials and structures in certain current and former
productions sites. If materials and structures containing asbestos become damaged or are renovated or
demolished, additional costs may be incurred.

If any of the above-mentioned risks were to materialize, they could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any potential non-compliance with
environmental, health and safety regulations could lead to administrative sanctions, such as warnings, fines and
suspension of activities, temporary or permanent withdrawal of permits and licenses granted from government
entities and/or public authorities and, potentially, criminal sanctions.

**_Product safety or quality failures could interrupt our manufacturing operations and we may be required to_**
**_pay damages or other remedies as a result of product liability claims._**

The quality and safety of our products is critical to the success of our business. The quality targets of our
customers in many product segments are very high and tend to have risen further in recent years, which
highlights the importance of consistency and repeatability in production processes to ensure customer
satisfaction. Furthermore, certain of our products are used in the food and medical industries, where key
customers have stringent requirements regarding the products they purchase and conduct regular audits to ensure
compliance with applicable regulations, including consumer protection, health, safety and hygiene standards. The
consequences of quality or safety issues due to, for example, accidental or malicious raw material contamination
or due to supply chain contamination caused by human error, sabotage or equipment fault could be severe.
Detected faults or defects in products or in product descriptions discovered at a critical point in our production
chain could interrupt production in the unit concerned and disturb the entire chain’s operations. Such
disturbances could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our products are generally integrated into and become a part of more valuable end products. If a product
supplied by us is found to be defective and causes the end product to fail, our potential liability may be higher
than the cost of the faulty product sold by us. In the event that effective contractual limitations of liability have
not been included in some of the supply agreements into which we have entered or will enter with our customers,
or if such limitations are not enforceable, we may be required to pay substantial damages if faulty products have
been or are delivered by us under such supply agreements. Such occurrences may also take substantial time to
resolve, including assessing potential liabilities and involving insurance companies. Any of the above could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient, potentially leaving us uninsured against certain risks._**

Globally, we have 45 production facilities located in several European countries, the United States, Brazil
and Asia, and damages to these facilities or interruptions in the production at these facilities may disrupt our
operations and lead to production loss, which can result in delivery problems and additional costs. There can be
no assurance that damages to the production facilities or losses resulting from production interruptions are fully
covered by insurance. The COVID-19 outbreak has adversely changed and may continue to change the
characteristics of the global insurance market, making it less favorable to insurers amidst the outbreak. We seek
to use leading insurance brokers and insurance companies for our business. However, our insurance coverage
may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential liabilities. Accordingly, a major claim, or a series of smaller
claims, for damages related to our products sold, or advice given to customers in connection with products sold,

45


-----

may not be fully covered by insurance, or may not be covered by insurance at all, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We maintain insurance coverage for, among other things, property damage, business interruption and
product and general liability in amounts believed to be consistent with industry practices, but it is not fully
insured against all risks, and insurance against all types of risks and catastrophic events may not be available on
reasonable economic terms or at all. In addition, our global operations make it more difficult to manage the
insurance coverage, as insurance practices and terms vary depending on the jurisdiction, and there can thus be no
assurance that we are able to maintain a sufficient insurance coverage in all the jurisdictions in which we operate.
The occurrence of an accident that causes losses in excess of limits specified under the relevant policy or is
subject to material deductibles or self-insured retentions, or losses arising from events not covered, or not fully
covered, by insurance policies, such as certain catastrophic events, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be exposed to natural catastrophic events
including, among others, windstorms, hailstorms, severe winter weather, floods, earthquakes and outbreaks of
disease, viruses and pandemics, which are inherently unpredictable in terms of both their occurrence, severity,
spread and potential harm to human beings. We may also be exposed to the risk of terrorism, the materialization
of which could have a material adverse effect on the industries in which we operate and our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_Financial difficulties or bankruptcy of one or more of our major customers or financing counterparties could_**
**_have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations._**

We are exposed to credit risk in relation to our accounts receivable from customers. As of December 31,
2020, our trade and other receivables amounted to €264.7 million. In the past, certain of our customers have
experienced, and may experience in the future, financial and operational challenges, the continuation or
exacerbation of which could place them in additional financial and operational distress or could even result in
their bankruptcy. Although we have in place certain procedures and controls, such as credit insurance and
additional credit risk assessment, such measures may not fully or adequately alleviate our exposure to such credit
risks. For example, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may have a negative effect on the business of our
customers, especially in the short-term. See “—The COVID-19 pandemic and possible future outbreaks could
_disrupt our business operations.”_

Furthermore, a prolonged duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, including any future outbreaks of the virus
or of a similar pandemic, or the other changes in the global economy may put additional financial stress on our
customers. Financial and operational challenges experienced by customers may impact our ability to collect
outstanding accounts receivables fully or in a timely manner, or at all, and, consequently, result in credit losses
and have a material adverse effect on our cash flows. In an uncertain economic situation, it may be difficult to
cover our customer credit risks with credit insurance. In addition, the failure by customers to fulfill their payment
obligations towards us may have a material adverse effect on the terms or availability of credit insurance for us.
These factors, combined with limited availability of credit, could also cause our customers to reduce the volume
of their purchases in an effort to improve their own financial position.

An uncertain economic situation also leads to increased counterparty risk, that is the risk that one or more of
our counterparties may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations to us. The financial downturn following
the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this risk. As uncertainty remains in the global markets, the global
economy could fall back into a recession which could lead to banks, insurance companies and other corporations
facing financial difficulties, which, in turn, may lead to corporate restructuring arrangements, states taking over
companies and bankruptcies. Despite any efforts by us to manage our counterparty risk, there is a possibility that
one or more of our counterparties could face serious financial difficulties or bankruptcy. If counterparty risk
materializes, we may have to absorb losses in an amount higher than expected or may incur costs relating to,
among other things, rearranging our credit transactions, including on less favorable terms, such as an incremental
change in our financing rate or insurance contracts. Further, counterparty risks that materialize could force us to
obtain alternative financing to meet our obligations under our financing arrangements, and such financing may
not be available on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. Materialization of a credit or counterparty risk could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations._**

We operate and sell products globally, and, as a result, we generate a portion of our sales and incur a portion
of our expenses in currencies other than our functional currency, euro, which are primarily U.S. dollar, Swedish

46


-----

krona, Chinese renminbi, Brazilian real, British pound sterling and South Korean won. As a result of our
significant presence in the United States, we are particularly exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate of the
U.S. dollar. In addition, purchase prices of pulp, chemicals and freight are primarily denominated in U.S. dollar,
and, following the Transactions, a large portion of our indebtedness will be denominated in U.S. dollars. We are
exposed to both transaction risk and translation risk. As we incur a portion of our expenses in currencies other
than the currencies in which we generate our sales, appreciation of a currency in which costs are incurred against
a currency in which sales are generated could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. To
reduce the impact of transaction exposure at the Group level, we have regularly hedged a forecasted exposure to
currencies in accordance with our hedging policies, See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Financial Risk—Market_
_Risk—Currency Risk.” Following the Transactions, we also expect to naturally hedge U.S. dollar translation risk_
by designating the USD Notes and the USD TLB Facility as hedges of our net investments denominated in U.S.
dollars. However, the hedging policies adopted by us may not be sufficient to reduce or eliminate such risk. In
addition, we report our results in euro, but have revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities in other currencies,
primarily as the result of our ownership of our foreign subsidiaries. Consequently, we are exposed to translation
risk to the extent that assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are reported in currencies other than euro. In order
to prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate the value of those assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses at then applicable exchange rates. For more information on currency risk management, see note 19
to the 2020 Financial Statements. As a result, any fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a material
adverse effect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_An impairment of goodwill, other tangible assets or property, plant and equipment could have a material_**
**_adverse effect on our financial position or operating results._**

As of December 31, 2020, Ahlstrom-Munksjö had €608.9 million of goodwill, €452.3 million of other
intangible assets, such as customer relationships, patents, trademarks and technology-related intangible assets,
and €1,032.3 million of property, plant and equipment in our balance sheet. Following the Transactions, we will
account for the Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with IFRS 3 (Business
_Combinations). The application of purchase accounting will result in the recognition of the acquired assets and_
assumed liabilities of Ahlstrom-Munksjö in the consolidated accounts of the Issuer at the acquisition date fair
values, which may result in significantly different carrying values for goodwill, intangible assets and property,
plant and equipment. Due to these and other potential adjustments, future financial statements for the Group
could be materially different and may not be comparable to our Financial Statements included elsewhere in this
Offering Memorandum, including but not limited to, risk of impairment of goodwill and intangible and tangible
assets, increased depreciation and amortization expenses over the remaining lives of the acquired assets and
recognition of temporary differences at the acquisition date. None of the financial information in this Offering
Memorandum have been adjusted to reflect the impact of any changes to the consolidated statement of financial
position, consolidated income statement and other comprehensive income (statement of comprehensive income),
consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows that might occur as a result
of purchase accounting adjustments to be applied as a result of the Transactions. See “Presentation of Financial
_and Other Information Ahlstrom-Munksjo¨—Comparability of the Financial Statements—Impact of the_
_Transactions.”_

**_Certain business area information presented on a pro forma basis included herein needs to be carefully_**
**_considered._**

For internal management reporting purposes, certain business area information has been presented as if
Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras had been consolidated for the results of the year ended December 31,
2018 and is included in the footnotes to the 2019 and 2018 Financial Statements prepared in accordance with
IFRS 8 (Operating Statements) and is presented on a comparable basis to such information for the year ended
December 31, 2019. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Ahlstrom-Munksjo¨—Comparability
_of the Financial Statements—Segment Reporting Principles” and “Presentation of Financial Information and_
_Other_ _Information—Ahlstrom-Munksjo¨—Comparability_ _of_ _the_ _Financial_ _Statements—Acquisitions_ _and_
_Disposals—Acquisitions of Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras.” Such information has not been audited and_
does not purport to reflect what the combined results of operations actually would have been had the acquisitions
of Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras been completed as of the date indicated. Any reliance you place on
this information should fully take this into consideration.

**_The As Adjusted EBITDA presented is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties._**

Our As Adjusted EBITDA presented in this Offering Memorandum represents Comparable EBITDA as
adjusted for certain cost savings programs, certain post-acquisition savings programs and a COVID-19
normalization, in each case, as further described under “Summary—Summary Consolidated Financial and Other
_Information—As Adjusted Data of the Issuer.” As Adjusted EBITDA has not been subject to audit and the_
adjustments and assumptions that have been used to prepare it may prove to be inaccurate or may be affected by
other factors that have not been accounted for. As Adjusted EBITDA is based on a number of assumptions and
estimates, including estimates with respect to certain cost savings that we expect to generate following the
Transactions and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. See “—We may not be able to realize the anticipated
_operational efficiencies and cost savings in the Acquisition.” Certain of these adjustments and estimates are_
forward-looking by nature and therefore subject to a number of assumptions about the timing, execution and
costs associated with implementing the underlying initiatives. Such assumptions are inherently uncertain and are
subject to significant business, economic and competition risk and uncertainties. See “Forward—Looking
_Statements.”_

As Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020 has not been prepared in accordance with
IFRS, the requirements of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act, the Prospectus Regulation or any generally
accepted accounting standards. Neither the assumptions underlying the adjustments nor the resulting As Adjusted
EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020 has been audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally
accepted auditing standards and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision. See
“Presentation of Financial and Other Information—As Adjusted Financial Information” and “Presentation of
_Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS Financial Measures.”_

**_Our tax burden could increase due to changes in tax laws or regulations or their application and_**
**_interpretation, or as a result of current or future tax audits._**

Due to the international nature of our business, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of several
jurisdictions, in particular with regard to transfer pricing rules. Related companies must conduct any intercompany transactions on an arm’s length basis and provide sufficient documentation thereof, subject to
applicable rules of the relevant jurisdiction. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(“OECD”) has recently published new guidance on transfer pricing. National tax authorities are increasingly
scrutinizing and challenging companies’ transfer pricing policies. In addition, the estimation of our total income
taxes requires thorough consideration and numerous filings in various countries and the final amount of taxes
related to certain transactions and calculations cannot be estimated with full certainty. Our tax burden is,
therefore, dependent on specific aspects of tax laws and regulations in several jurisdictions including their
application and interpretation. Changes in tax laws or regulations or their application or interpretation could
significantly increase our tax burden, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations. These include the recent limitations on the right to deduct interest expense
and controlled foreign company rules, implemented into national tax laws and applied as of the year 2019, due to
the Council Directive (EU) 2016/1164 of 12 July 2016 laying down rules against tax avoidance practices that
directly affect the functioning of the internal market (as amended from time to time). Furthermore, the
introduction of the OECD multilateral instrument and the inclusion of the so-called principal purpose test in the
same could increase uncertainty with respect to application of tax treaties.

In addition, we are currently and will be, from time to time, subject to general tax audits by national tax
authorities. At the date of this Offering Memorandum, we are subject to tax audits or tax litigation in Italy,
Germany, India, Brazil, the United States (Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Illinois) and China. As a result of
ongoing or future tax audits or other review actions of tax or other authorities, additional taxes (such as income
taxes, withholding taxes, real estate taxes, capital gains taxes, transfer taxes and value added taxes) could be
imposed, which could lead to an increase in our tax liabilities either as a result of the relevant tax payment being
imposed directly against us or as a result of us becoming liable for the relevant tax as a secondary obligor.

Tax audits and claims could have a material adverse effect on us. We and our predecessors have historically
grown by acquisitions, with the most significant being the Expera Acquisition and the Caieiras Acquisition in
2018. Tax authorities may question some of the positions that we or our predecessors have taken and,
consequently, additional taxes may be assessed, or tax assets may be challenged. The main items under
discussion or already disputed relate to transfer pricing and business-related taxes. Although we currently believe
that the above-mentioned processes will not have any significant effect on our financial position or profitability,

48


-----

the realization of any risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_We may be unable to utilize our deferred tax assets._**

As of December 31, 2020, Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s recorded deferred tax assets (after netting) and deferred tax
liabilities were €6.1 million and €141.7 million, respectively. Our ability to generate taxable income will be
subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our
control. If we generate a lower taxable income than the amount assumed in determining our deferred tax assets or
if tax rates are lowered, the value of our deferred tax assets would be reduced. Any of these factors could have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

**_Costs related to pension benefit plans could increase._**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö has established certain defined pension benefit and defined pension contribution plans in
various countries in which it operates or have liability for such plans as part of its historical operations.
Accordingly, we will be exposed to various risks related to our defined benefit plans, including the risk of actual
investment returns being lower than assumed rates of return and the risk of results deviating from actuarial
assumptions for areas such as mortality of plan participants. In addition, fluctuations in interest rates may cause
changes in the annual cost and benefit obligations. Higher than expected inflation may increase benefit
obligations and annual payments to insurance companies. The additional amount of future contributions to our
defined benefit plans will depend upon factors mentioned above and, as a result, the amounts we will be required
to contribute in the future may vary. Cash contributions to defined benefit plans will reduce cash available for
our business. The above-mentioned risks relate in particular to our plans that are in effect in Sweden, Germany,
France, Italy, the United States and the United Kingdom. As of December 31, 2020, Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s
employee benefit obligations in the balance sheet amounted to €93.1 million. Any of the above-mentioned risks,
if they were to materialize, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations.

**_We are subject to the risk of labor disputes, work stoppages and increased labor costs._**

Most of our employees are represented by labor unions. Although we believe that our relations with our
employees and with our labor unions are generally good, there can be no assurance that this will continue to be
the case. A deterioration of relationships between us and our employees and labor unions could result in strikes
or work stoppages at any of our facilities. In addition, our relations with employees represented by a labor union
are governed by certain collective bargaining agreements and we may not be able to renegotiate satisfactory
collective bargaining agreements when they expire, which could lead to, among other consequences, increased
labor costs. Such renegotiation could also lead to disputes which may disrupt operations at our production sites.
Labor disputes in the transportation sector may prevent the distribution of our products, and labor disputes
affecting our suppliers or customers may result in variations in the supply of products and materials to us and in
demand for our products and services. Any sustained labor dispute leading to a substantial interruption in our
overall business, increased labor costs or changes to the terms of collective bargaining agreements could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may from time to time be involved in litigation and other similar proceedings that could have a material_**
**_adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations._**

We may from time to time be involved in litigation and other similar proceedings and further disputes could
arise in the ordinary course of business related to, among others, contracts, tax issues, alleged defects in product
deliveries, health and safety matters, competition law, intellectual property, employment matters, and
environmental issues. Such litigation and other similar proceedings may be costly, divert management attention,
disrupt normal operations and result in reputational damage for us. The outcome of any dispute is impossible to
predict. It is also impossible to rule out the possibility of an unfavorable outcome in ongoing proceedings, or any
proceedings that may arise in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_Concerns about the effects of climate change may have an impact on our business._**

Concerns about global warming and carbon footprints, as well as legal and financial incentives favoring
alternative fuels, are causing the increased use of sustainable, non-fossil fuel sources for electricity generation.

49


-----

Electricity generation companies are competing in the same markets as us for the same raw materials that we use
in some of our production process, namely wood and derivative products, driving prices for such materials
upwards, especially during the winter in the Northern hemisphere. Climate change could also cause the spread of
disease and pestilence into plantations and fiber sources, far beyond their traditional geographic spreads,
increasing the risk that the wood supply necessary to our operations may be negatively impacted. If either of
these phenomena intensifies, additional costs or supply shortages could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**Risks Related to the Transactions**

**_Ownership of 100% of the Company Shares is dependent on the completion of the Squeeze-Out._**

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Issuer owns 90.6% of the Company Shares. The Issuer has
filed an application to initiate the Squeeze-Out proceedings as provided in the Finnish Companies Act in order to
gain 100% of the Company Shares. Until such time as the Squeeze-Out has completed or the Issuer has obtained
advance title to the remaining minority Company Shares against the placing of a security under the Squeeze-out
proceedings, third-party minority shareholders will continue to hold the outstanding Company Shares. The
Squeeze-Out is an arbitral proceeding regulated by the Finnish Companies Act and the Finnish Arbitration Act,
which could potentially be time consuming, and is subject to appeal by one or more minority shareholders. These
proceedings typically take approximately eight to twelve months to complete but advance title to the minority
shares may, subject to the discretion of the arbitral tribunal, under the proceedings often be obtained in
approximately four to six months against the placing of a security. These proceedings may also be longer due to
events outside the Issuer’s control. Further, in the event that the placing of a security by the Issuer for obtaining
of the advance title is refused by the arbitral tribunal, the Issuer could decide not to place such security or appeal
the arbitral award and if the Issuer decides not to pay the redemption price in accordance with such award, the
minority shareholders would potentially continue to hold some or all of the outstanding Company Shares until
the Issuer’s redemption right and the redemption price have been finally determined by a non-appealable arbitral
award or court decision and such redemption price has been paid by the Issuer.

**_The Sponsors’ opportunity to conduct due diligence with respect to Ahlstrom-Munksjö was limited, and their_**
**_due diligence may not have revealed all facts that may be relevant in connection with the Acquisition._**

Before making investments, the Sponsors conduct due diligence that they deem reasonable and appropriate
based on the facts and circumstances applicable to each investment. The objectives of the due diligence process
are to identify attractive investment opportunities based on the facts and circumstances relevant to a specific
asset, to identify possible risks associated with such asset and to prepare a framework that may be used from the
date of the acquisition of such asset to drive operational achievement and value creation in such asset. When
conducting due diligence, the Sponsors typically evaluate a number of important business, financial, tax,
accounting, environmental and legal issues in determining whether or not to proceed with an investment.

Outside consultants, legal advisors, accountants and investment banks are involved in the due diligence
process in varying degrees depending on the type of investment. Nevertheless, when conducting due diligence
and making an assessment regarding an investment, the Sponsors rely on resources available to them, including
information provided by the target of the investment and, in some circumstances, third party investigations.
Instances of bribery, fraud, accounting irregularities, contingent liabilities and other improper, illegal or corrupt
practices can be difficult to detect, and fraud and other deceptive practices can be widespread in certain
jurisdictions.

There may be liabilities that the Sponsors failed or were unable to discover in the course of performing due
diligence investigations into us and our subsidiaries in connection with the Acquisition. Following the
Acquisition, the Sponsors may learn of additional information about us and/or any of our subsidiaries that
adversely affect us, such as unknown or contingent liabilities and issues relating to compliance with applicable
laws. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial position and results of operations.

As Ahlstrom-Munksjö is a publicly listed company, the due diligence conducted for the Acquisition was
mostly limited to publicly available information and certain other information made available to the Sponsors as
part of their due diligence process. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that the Sponsors’ due diligence
investigation has revealed or highlighted all relevant facts (including fraud, bribery and other illegal activities
and contingent liabilities) that may be necessary or helpful in evaluating the merits of investing in us. We cannot
be certain that the Sponsors’ due diligence investigations will result in the Sponsors’ investment in us being

50


-----

successful or that the actual financial performance of such investment will not fall short of the financial
projections the Sponsors used when evaluating that investment.

**_We may not be able to realize the anticipated operational efficiencies and cost savings in the Acquisition._**

The Sponsors intend to implement certain operational efficiency and cost saving measures in connection
with the Acquisition. We may not be able to realize the anticipated efficiencies and savings targeted by these
measures, either in the amount or within the timeframe that we currently anticipate, and the costs of achieving
these measures may be higher than what we expect.

Our estimated efficiency gains and costs savings are forward-looking and therefore subject to a number of
assumptions about the timing, execution and costs associated with realizing the underlying measures. Such
assumptions are inherently uncertain and are subject to significant business, economic and competition risks and
uncertainties. There can be no assurance that such assumptions will turn out to be correct. In addition, the
estimated efficiency gains and cost savings may be offset by deterioration in the markets in which we operate,
increases in other expenses or challenges in the business unrelated to the Transactions. As a result, the amount of
efficiency gains and savings that we will actually realize and/or the timing of any such realization may differ
significantly (and may be significantly lower or later) from the ones that we currently estimate and we may incur
significant costs in realizing the Acquisition and in reaching the estimated gains and savings. Failure to achieve
the expected efficiency gains and savings may result in a lower return on investment for the Acquisition and
could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

**_The Acquisition will entitle certain of Ahlstrom-Munksjö‘s customers and business partners to terminate their_**
**_agreements with Ahlstrom-Munksjö as a result of change of control provisions._**

Certain of the agreements entered into by Ahlstrom-Munksjö and its subsidiaries include change of control
provisions. The Acquisition may constitute a change of control under such agreements. As a result,
counterparties to these agreements may be entitled to terminate their agreements with Ahlstrom-Munksjö as a
result of the Acquisition. Some of these counterparties may exercise their termination rights, which could have an
adverse effect on Ahlstrom-Munksjö‘s business, financial position and results of operations. In addition, changes
of control may be subject to approval by governmental authorities.

In the event of termination of any material contract as a result of the Acquisition, there can be no assurance
that Ahlstrom-Munksjö would be able to successfully replace any products or services that were provided under
the relevant contract at attractive prices or at all. Likewise, if Ahlstrom-Munksjö is required to amend any such
contract, we can provide no assurance that the terms of such amendment will not be materially adverse to us or
will not otherwise impact Ahlstrom-Munksjö‘s business or operations. Accordingly, any termination or
amendment of a significant contract as a result of the change of control could materially or adversely affect
Ahlstrom-Munksjö‘s business and the ability to provide services to our customers. It is also possible that material
supply contracts could be terminated or amended in other circumstances. Any such termination or amendment
could have a material adverse effect on Ahlstrom-Munksjö‘s business, results of operations and financial
condition.

**Risks Related to our Indebtedness**

**_Our significant amount of debt and debt service obligations could materially adversely affect our business,_**
**_financial position and results of operations and preclude us from satisfying our obligations under the Notes_**
**_and the Note Guarantees._**

We have a significant amount of debt and debt service obligations. As of December 31, 2020, after giving
effect to the Transactions, we would have had total as adjusted indebtedness (including lease liabilities
amounting to €51.0 million) in a nominal amount of €1,845.6 million (equivalent), of which €1,650.0 million
(equivalent) is senior secured indebtedness consisting of the Notes and the Senior Term Facilities. As of the date
of this Offering Memorandum, there were no cash drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility. See
“Capitalization,” “Description of Other Indebtedness,” and “Description of the Notes.” We anticipate that our
high leverage will continue to exist for the foreseeable future.

The degree to which we will be leveraged following completion of the Transactions could have important
consequences to holders of the Notes, including, but not limited to:

   - making it more difficult for the Issuer and its subsidiaries to satisfy their respective obligations with
respect to the Notes, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and other debt and liabilities we may incur;

51


-----

   - increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic
and industry conditions;

   - requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of
principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to
fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures, product research and
development, or other general corporate purposes;

   - restricting us from pursuing acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities;

   - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the competitive
environment and the industry in which we operate;

   - negatively impacting credit terms with our suppliers and other creditors;

   - increasing our exposure to interest rate increases because some of our indebtedness bears a floating rate
of interest;

   - placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged;

   - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future operations, capital expenditures,
business opportunities, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and increasing the cost of any
future borrowings;

   - limiting our ability to obtain additional capacity for issuance of bid, advance payment, performance
and warranty guarantees for operative business purposes and increasing the cost of any future
guarantee issuances; and

   - tax implications arising from the Transactions, tax deductibility of interest costs thereon, an increase in
our effective tax rate and tax jurisdictions involved.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy
our obligations, including under the Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.

**_The Issuer is a holding company that has no revenue generating operations of its own and will depend on_**
**_cash from the operating companies of the Group to be able to make payments on the Notes and the Note_**
**_Guarantees._**

The Issuer is a holding company with no business operations other than management of the equity interests
it holds in its subsidiaries. The Issuer will be dependent upon the cash flow from its operating subsidiaries in the
form of dividends or other distributions or payments to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the
Notes and the Note Guarantees. Given the Group’s international operations, it has a large number of operating
subsidiaries and business participations, which individually contribute to our Group’s results. The amounts of
dividends and distributions available to the Issuer will depend on the profitability and cash flows of their
subsidiaries and the ability of each of those subsidiaries to declare dividends under applicable law or transfer
profits under profit and loss transfer agreements, if applicable. The Issuer’s subsidiaries, however, may not be
able to, or may not be permitted under applicable law to, make distributions or advance upstream loans to the
Issuer to make payments in respect of their indebtedness, including the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

Various agreements governing our debt may restrict and, in some cases may actually prohibit, the ability of
these subsidiaries to move cash within their restricted group. Applicable tax laws may also subject such
payments to further taxation. Applicable law as well as profit and loss transfer agreements between several
entities of the Group may also limit the amounts that some of our subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as
dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or even prevent such payments. In particular, the ability of the
Issuer’s subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Issuer will generally be limited to the amount of distributable
reserves available to each of them and the ability to pay their respective debt when due. The subsidiaries of the
Issuer that do not guarantee the Notes have no direct obligation to make payments with respect to the Notes or
the Note Guarantees.

While the Indenture limits the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their
ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments, these limitations are subject to significant
qualifications and exceptions, including exceptions for restrictions imposed by applicable law.

**_We may incur substantially more debt in the future, which may make it difficult for us to service our debt,_**
**_including the Notes, and impair our ability to operate our businesses._**

Despite our substantial leverage, we may incur substantial additional debt in the future. We have the ability
to borrow up to approximately €325.0 million (equivalent) under our Revolving Credit Facility, which will be
secured by the Collateral, and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement permits, and the Indenture will
permit, the incurrence of additional debt thereunder, including additional debt that may be secured on the
Collateral. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement permits, and the Indenture will permit, us to incur a
substantial amount of indebtedness at subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes and to incur indebtedness that
may be secured on the assets comprising in the Collateral or that benefits from security interests over assets that
do not secure the Notes. Any debt that our subsidiaries incur could be structurally or effectively senior to the
Notes to the extent that such subsidiaries do not guarantee the Notes such debt is secured by liens that do not
secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of such property and assets securing such debt. Moreover, we will be
permitted to incur other debt that matures prior to the Notes. Although the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement contains, and the Indenture will contain, restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness,
these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain
circumstances the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be
substantial. If the Issuer and its subsidiaries increase their existing debt levels, the related risks would increase. In
addition, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement does not, and the Indenture will not, prevent us from
incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements. Our inability to service our debt
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and our ability to
fulfil our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**_We are subject to restrictive covenants that will limit our operating and financial flexibility._**

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement contains, and the Indenture will contain, covenants which
impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These agreements limit our ability to, among other
things:

   - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock;

   - make certain restricted payments and investments;

   - transfer or sell assets;

   - enter into transactions with affiliates;

   - create or incur certain liens;

   - make certain loans, investments or acquisitions;

   - issue or sell share capital of certain of our subsidiaries;

   - create or incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments
to us;

   - take certain actions that would impair the security interests in the Collateral granted for the benefit of
the holders of the Notes;

   - merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; and

   - pay or redeem subordinated debt or equity.

All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the
_Notes—Certain Covenants.” The covenants to which we will be subject could limit our ability to finance our_
future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in
our interest.

In addition, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement requires us to comply with certain affirmative
covenants while amounts under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities remain outstanding. Furthermore, under
certain circumstances, the Revolving Credit Facility under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement will
require us to comply with a financial ratio while amounts exceeding a certain threshold remains outstanding
under the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Senior Secured Credit Facilities
_Agreement.” Our ability to meet the financial ratio under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement may be_
affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet such financial ratio, which

53


-----

could result in a draw stop under the Revolving Credit Facility. A breach of any of the covenants or restrictions
under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement could result in an event of default under the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities Agreement. Upon the occurrence of a payment event of default that is continuing under the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, subject to the applicable cure period and any other limitations on
acceleration or enforcement, the relevant creditors could cancel the availability of the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities and elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, together with
accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, a default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross-default or crossacceleration provisions, including the Indenture. If our creditors, including the creditors under the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities, accelerate the payment of those amounts, we cannot assure you that our assets and the assets of
our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of our
subsidiaries that would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the Notes. In addition, if
we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could proceed against any Collateral granted to them to
secure repayment of those amounts.

**_We will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations, which we may not_**
**_be able to generate or raise._**

Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities and our obligations under the Notes, and to fund our ongoing operations or expansion
plans, will depend on our future performance and ability to generate cash, which, to a certain extent, is subject to
the success of our business strategy as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, legal,
regulatory and other factors, as well as other factors discussed in these “Risk Factors,” many of which are
beyond our control.

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that currently
anticipated growth, cost savings or efficiencies will be realized or that future debt financing will be available to
us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund our other
liquidity needs including the repayment at maturity of the then outstanding amount under the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities. At the maturity of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (including the Revolving Credit Facility,
which matures six months before the Notes), the Notes or any other debt that we may incur, if we do not have
sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital resources to pay our debt obligations, or to fund our other
liquidity needs, we may be required to refinance or restructure our indebtedness.

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations as
they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

   - sell assets;

   - obtain additional debt or equity capital; or

   - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.

The type, timing and terms of any future financing, restructuring, asset sales or other capital raising
transactions will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We cannot
assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory
terms, if at all. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay any portion or all of our debt.

Any failure to make payments on the Notes on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit
rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the terms of our debt,
including the Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, limit or will limit, and any future debt may limit,
our ability to pursue any of these alternatives. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and
may require us to comply with more onerous covenant or other terms, which could further restrict our business,
financial position and results of operations. There can be no assurances that any assets that we could be required
to dispose of could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount of proceeds realized from such
sale would be acceptable. If we are unsuccessful in any of these efforts, we may not have sufficient cash to meet
our obligations.

**_The Senior Secured Credit Facilities bear interest at floating rates that could rise significantly, thereby_**
**_increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow._**

Debt under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities will bear interest at a variable rate based on the Euro
Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”) and the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) (in each case, subject

54


-----

to a zero floor if less than zero) plus an applicable margin. These interest rates could rise significantly in the
future, increasing our interest expense associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital
expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes. Neither the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities Agreement nor the Indenture contains a covenant requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our
floating rate debt.

Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these
rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms.
Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to
terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to rise significantly, our interest expense
would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow.

Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, a measure of interbank lending rates, regulators and law
enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union are conducting investigations into
whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily EURIBOR or the calculation of
LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate EURIBOR and LIBOR. In addition, LIBOR,
EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” are
the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO
Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as
benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds,
which entered into force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of
administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or
benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. For
example, on July 27, 2017, the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or
compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021 (the “FCA
Announcement”). The FCA Announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot
and will not be guaranteed after 2021. The potential elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other
benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law
enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or LIBOR is determined, which
could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt
linked to such benchmark (including but not limited to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities whose interest rates
are linked to LIBOR and EURIBOR). Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation
thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an
adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest. In addition, on
November 29, 2017, the Bank of England and the FCA announced that the market working group on Sterling
Risk-Free Rates would have an extended mandate to catalyze a broad transition to the Sterling Over Night Index
Average Rate (“SONIA”) across sterling bond, loan and derivatives markets so that SONIA is established as the
primary sterling interest rate benchmark by the end of 2021. The Bank of England and FCA have stated that a
key near-term priority for the working group will be to make recommendations relating to the potential
development of SONIA reference rates. A public consultation was launched in July 2018 in relation to specific
queries related to the operations of SONIA reference rates. On April 23, 2018, the Bank of England took over
administration of SONIA and issued a series of reforms as part of its implementation as a replacement to LIBOR.
From April 2018, the Bank of England has been setting the interest rate benchmark using SONIA, meaning that
banks are no longer compelled by the FCA to submit LIBOR rates beyond 2021. These reforms and other
pressures may cause such benchmarks to disappear entirely, to perform differently than in the past (as a result of
a change in methodology or otherwise), create disincentives for market participants to continue to administer or
participate in certain benchmarks or have other consequences which cannot be predicted.

**_The interests of the Sponsors may conflict with your interests as a holder of the Notes._**

The Sponsors collectively beneficially own 100% of the equity of the Issuer and approximately 90.6% of the
Company Shares and will hold the entire share capital of the Company following the Squeeze-Out Completion
Date. See “Summary—The Transactions.” As a result, our shareholders have and will continue to have, directly
or indirectly, the power to affect our legal and capital structure as well as the ability to elect and change our
management and to approve other changes to our operations and to influence the outcome of matters requiring
action by our shareholders. Our shareholders’ interests in certain circumstances may conflict with your interests
as noteholders, particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. For
example, the shareholders could vote to cause us to incur additional indebtedness. Our Sponsors are in the
business of making investments in companies and may acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete

55


-----

directly or indirectly with us. Our Sponsors may also pursue acquisition opportunities that are complementary to
our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. In addition, our
shareholders have held, hold or may hold interests in suppliers or customers of the Group. Our shareholders and
their affiliates could also have an interest in pursuing divestitures (including one or more divestitures of all or
part of our business or sales of our shares which would result in changes to our shareholding structure),
financings, dividend distributions or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity
investments, although such transactions might involve risks to you as a holder of Notes.

**Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure**

**_The Notes will not be initially secured by all of the Collateral._**

On the Issue Date, and until up to 120 days from the Business Day falling immediately after the
Squeeze-Out Completion Date, the Notes will not be secured by all of the Collateral, as further described under
“Description of the Notes—Security.” Subject to and in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, the
Notes will be secured on a first-priority basis, on the Issue Date, by the Issue Date Collateral, and the Notes will
be secured within 120 days from the Business Day falling immediately after the Squeeze-Out Completion Date,
by the Post Squeeze-Out Collateral. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in procuring such liens
within the time periods specified. The security interests will be limited to the same extent as those under the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities and otherwise as set forth under “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and
_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests,” which_
limitations could be significant. See also “—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance
_and other limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and_
_enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral.”_

**_If the Revolving Credit Facility is designated as a super senior liability in accordance with the terms of the_**
**_Intercreditor Agreement, creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging_**
**_obligations and future indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Indenture and the_**
**_Intercreditor Agreement ranking pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility are entitled to be repaid with_**
**_proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in priority over the Notes._**

The Intercreditor Agreement includes provisions governing the sharing of proceeds from enforcement of the
Collateral. Such enforcement proceeds are required to be turned over to the Security Agent after certain events,
including the acceleration of the Notes. The Security Agent is required to apply turned-over amounts and other
recoveries by the Security Agent from enforcement actions toward discharging the super senior obligations
(including, among others, (following the designation of the Revolving Credit Facility as a super senior liability in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) those under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain
hedging obligations and future indebtedness that may be secured on a super senior basis (the “Super Senior
Liabilities”)) in priority to applying any such amounts toward discharging the Notes. As such, in the event of a
foreclosure of the Collateral, you may not benefit from such recoveries if the then outstanding claims under such
Super Senior Liabilities are greater than the proceeds recovered. Any proceeds remaining from an enforcement
sale of the Collateral will, after all obligations under such Super Senior Liabilities have been discharged, be
applied pro rata in repayment of the Senior Term Facilities, the Notes, (unless the Revolving Credit Facility has
been designated as a super senior liability in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) the
Revolving Credit Facility and any other indebtedness that ranks pari passu with the Notes.

Furthermore, claims of our secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also secure the Notes will
have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Notes. As such, the claims of the
holders of the Notes will be effectively subordinated to the rights of such secured creditors to the extent of the
value of the assets securing such indebtedness.

**_The Issuer and the Guarantors will have control over the Collateral, and the sale of particular assets could_**
**_reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._**

The Transaction Security Documents relating to the Notes will allow the Issuer, the Guarantors and the
other security providers to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect,
invest and dispose of any income from the Collateral to the extent that it relates to their assets. So long as no
acceleration event has occurred and subject to certain conditions, the Issuer, the Guarantors and the other security
providers may, among other things, without any release or consent by the Security Agent, conduct ordinary
course activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of
the Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of indebtedness.

56


-----

**_Holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral._**

The obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof will be secured on a first-ranking basis
with security interests over the Collateral that also secure our obligations under the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities. The Senior Secured Credit Facility permits, and the Indenture will permit, additional indebtedness to
be secured on the Collateral in accordance with the terms thereof and the Intercreditor Agreement. The
Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent will only enforce the Collateral as provided for in the
Intercreditor Agreement, and the Indenture regulates the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes to
instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action.

Prior to the Issuer designating any liabilities as Super Senior Liabilities in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement (such date of designation (if any), the “Designation Date”), the Security Agent is not
required to take enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an instructing group that consists of the holders
of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, the senior lenders, creditors in respect of
indebtedness ranking pari passu with the senior creditors and creditors in respect of certain non-priority hedging
obligations (the “Senior Secured Credit Participations”) which aggregate more than 50% of the total Senior
Secured Credit Participations at that time (the “Majority Senior Secured Creditors”) (in each case acting through
their respective creditor representatives). If the Majority Senior Secured Creditors do not instruct the Security
Agent to enforce, or instruct the Security Agent to cease enforcing the transaction security, then, in certain cases,
creditors holding more than 50% of the total second lien credit participations (or, in certain cases, creditors
holding 50% of the total Topco credit participations) may instruct the Security Agent to enforce.

Following the Designation Date, the Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action unless
instructed to do so by an instructing group that may consist of either (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or
(ii) creditors holding more than 50% of the total participations in Super Senior Liabilities at that time (the
“Majority Super Senior Creditors”). The Security Agent is required to act in accordance with instructions
received from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, however: (i) if and to the extent the obligations under the
Super Senior Liabilities have not been fully discharged in cash within six months of enforcement instructions
first being issued by either the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors; or
(ii) if the Security Agent has not commenced enforcement action within three months of enforcement instructions
first being issued by either the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors, then
the enforcement instructions provided by the Majority Super Senior Creditors will prevail.

Following the transaction security having become enforceable, if (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors
have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to
pursue and (ii) (x) the Majority Super Senior Creditors determine in good faith that to delay issuing enforcement
instructions could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to
enforce any transaction security or the realization of enforcement proceeds and (y) deliver enforcement
instructions which they reasonably believe to be consistent with the enforcement principles and necessary or
desirable to enhance the prospects of achieving the enforcement objectives before the security agent has received
any enforcement instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, in such circumstances, the Security
Agent shall act in accordance with the enforcement instructions received from the Majority Super Senior
Creditors.

If at any time an insolvency event has occurred with respect to any debtor (other than an insolvency event
which is the direct result of any action taken by the Security Agent acting on the instructions of the Majority
Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors), the Security Agent shall act (i) prior to the
Designation Date, in accordance with the instructions of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (without any
requirement to first consult with any junior creditors) or (ii) after the Designation Date and to the extent the
Majority Super Senior Creditors have provided such instructions, in accordance with the instructions received
from the Majority Super Senior Creditors.

The Security Agent is not obliged to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in
the performance of its duties, obligations or responsibilities or the exercise of any right, power, authority or
discretion if it has grounds for believing the repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against, or security
for, such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it by a member of the Group. In connection with any
enforcement instructions received by it, the Security Agent may request security and/or indemnity and/or
prefunding satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense (including legal fees).

To the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Notes (such as
indebtedness incurred as an additional facility under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement), the voting

57


-----

interest of holders of the Notes in an instructing group will be diluted commensurate with the amount of
indebtedness we incur.

Creditors of any future Super Senior Liabilities may have interests that are different from the interests of
holders of the Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their
remedies under the Transaction Security Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders
of the Notes to do so. In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral consisting of the shares of the Issuer or
any of its subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims
under the Note Guarantees and the liens over any other assets of such entities securing the Notes and the Note
Guarantees may be released. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement” and
“Description of the Notes—Security—Release of Liens.”

Delays in enforcement could decrease or eliminate recovery values. In addition, the holders of the Notes
will not have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Transaction Security Documents
or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the Transaction Security Documents, except through the
Security Agent as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting the Notes, you will be deemed to have
agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited remedies and
recourse against the Issuer and the Guarantors in the event of a default. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—
_Intercreditor Agreement.”_

**_The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that will be granted as security for_**
**_the Notes, future secured indebtedness may be secured by certain assets that do not secure the Notes and it_**
**_may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral and the Collateral may be reduced or diluted under_**
**_certain circumstances._**

Holders of the Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the assets underlying the security
interests granted in favor of holders of the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Security.” In the event of an
enforcement of the security interests in respect of the Collateral following an event of default, the proceeds from
the sale of the assets underlying the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations with
respect to the Notes. No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been, or will be, made in connection with this
Offering. The value of the assets underlying the pledges will also depend on many factors, including, among
other things, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such
sale, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale and the condition of the economies in which operations are
located and the availability of buyers.

In addition, the Collateral secures, or will secure, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and may secure
certain future indebtedness of the Group. Not all of our assets will secure the Notes and the Indenture will allow
the Issuer and its subsidiaries to secure certain indebtedness (which may be structurally senior to the Notes and
the Note Guarantees) with the property and assets of the Issuer and its subsidiaries that do not secure the Notes.
The value of such assets and property could be significant. If an event of default occurs and the obligations under
the Notes are accelerated, the Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof will not benefit from the assets securing
such secured debt and will rank equally with the holders of other unsecured indebtedness of the Issuer and their
restricted subsidiaries with respect to any property or assets excluded from the Collateral securing the Notes.

While the Indenture will create certain obligations to provide additional guarantees and grant additional
security over assets, or a particular class of assets, whether as a result of the acquisition or creation of future
assets or subsidiaries or otherwise, such obligations will be subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain
important exemptions and carve-outs. The Agreed Security Principles that will be set forth in the Indenture will
include a number of limitations on the rights of the holders of the Notes to be granted security or guarantees in
certain circumstances. The operation of the Agreed Security Principles may result in, among other things, the
amount recoverable under any security provided being limited or security not being granted over a particular type
or class of assets. See “Description of the Notes—Security.” Accordingly, the Agreed Security Principles may
affect the value of the security or guarantees provided by the Issuer and the Guarantors.

The shares and other Collateral that will be pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Notes
may provide for only limited repayment of the Notes, in part because most of such collateral may not be liquid
and its value to other parties may be less than their value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the
Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof.
Industry regulations in certain jurisdictions in which we operate include restrictions on persons who may hold
certain of our licenses, authorizations and consents that are necessary to operate our business. In the event of
foreclosure, the transfer of our business operations may be prohibited or only permitted to a limited group of

58


-----

investors eligible to hold such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, entry into the
Transaction Security Documents, enforcement of the Collateral and any transfer of our operations may require, in
certain jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings or might otherwise be
challenged. Such consents, approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result,
enforcement may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may occur, and the value of the Collateral may
be significantly decreased. Most of our assets do not secure the Notes and it is possible that the value of the
Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness secured by such Collateral. With respect to
any shares of our subsidiaries pledged to secure the Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof, such shares may also
have limited value in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s
shares that have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must
first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a
pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In
addition, the value of the Collateral may decline over time. If the proceeds of the Collateral are not sufficient to
repay all amounts due on the Notes, the holders of the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the
sale of the Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the Issuer’s and the
Guarantors’ remaining assets.

The Indenture will also permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of the
Notes on the Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness or third parties enjoy liens,
including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Indenture or the Transaction Security Documents, such
holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral which, if exercised, could
reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Notes. Moreover, if we issue additional Notes
under the Indenture or incur additional indebtedness, including indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities Agreement, holders of such Notes or lenders of such debt would benefit from the same collateral as the
holders of the Notes being offered hereby, thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on the Collateral.
See also “—Holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral.”

**_Not all of the Guarantors will initially guarantee the Notes._**

On the Issue Date, the Notes will only be guaranteed by U.S. Holdco. Subject to and in accordance with the
Agreed Security Principles, we expect that the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior secured basis by either
(a) the Company, Ahlstrom-Munksjo¨ Tampere Oy, Ahlstrom-Munksjo¨ Industries S.A.S, Ahlstrom-Munksjo¨
France Holding S.A.S, Ahlstrom-Munksjo¨ La Ge`re S.A.S, Ahlstrom-Munksjo¨ Specialties S.A.S, AhlstromMunksjo¨ Arches S.A.S, Ahlstrom-Munksjo¨ Brignoud S.A.S, Ahlstrom-Munksjo¨ Italia S.p.A., Ahlstrom-Munksjo
USA Inc., Ahlstrom-Munksjo Nonwovens LLC, Ahlstrom-Munksjo Filtration LLC, Ahlstrom-Munksjo NA
Specialty Solutions Holdings Inc., Ahlstrom-Munksjo NA Specialty Solutions LLC and Ahlstrom-Munksjo
Mosinee LLC or (b) such other combination of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer that guarantee the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities Agreement within 120 days from the Business Day falling immediately after the
Squeeze-Out Completion Date. Such Post Squeeze-Out Guarantors are expected to be incorporated in Finland,
France, Italy and the United States. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, our Post Squeeze-Out
Guarantors accounted for 53% of our consolidated assets, 48% of our consolidated net sales and 70% of our
consolidated EBITDA. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in procuring such additional Note
Guarantees within the time period specified. The Note Guarantees will be limited as set forth in “Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and_
_the Security Interests.”_

**_The granting of the Note Guarantees and security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or_**
**_the incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening or voidance periods for such_**
**_security interests in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions._**

The granting of the Note Guarantees and security interests to secure the Notes may create hardening or
voidance periods for such Note Guarantees and security interests in certain jurisdictions. The granting of shared
security interests to secure future permitted debt may restart or reopen such hardening or voidance periods in
particular, as the Indenture will permit the release and retaking of security granted in favor of the Notes in certain
circumstances including in connection with the incurrence of future debt. The applicable hardening or voidance
period for these new security interests can run from the moment each new security interest has been granted or
perfected. Under Italian law, if any security interests (including security interests in the Collateral) are released
and retaken at any time, such release and retaking of security interests may give rise to the start of a new
hardening period in respect of such security interests. At each time, if the security interest granted or recreated

59


-----

were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening or voidance period applicable in such jurisdiction,
it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce and/or it may be subject to
recovery. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the
_Note Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

The same rights also apply following the issuance of the Notes in connection with the accession of further
subsidiaries as additional guarantors and the granting of security interest over their relevant assets and equity
interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes, as applicable.

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes or under the Note Guarantees thereof or the Collateral across_**
**_multiple jurisdictions may prove difficult._**

The Issuer is organized under the laws of Finland. The subsidiaries of the Issuer that are expected to provide
Note Guarantees are organized under the laws of Finland, France, Italy and the United States. The Collateral
includes the shares of certain of our subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of those jurisdictions, and certain
present and future intercompany loan receivables held by the Issuer and certain of their subsidiaries in respect of
debtors in certain of these jurisdictions. In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, administration or a similar event,
proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions. Your rights under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and
the Collateral are likely to be subject to insolvency and administrative laws of several jurisdictions and there can
be no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex proceedings. In addition,
the multi-jurisdictional nature of enforcement over the Collateral may limit the realizable value of the Collateral.

The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdiction of organization of the Issuer and the
Guarantors may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and with the laws of the United States,
including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain
post-petition interest, the duration of proceeding and preference periods. The application of these laws, and any
conflict between them, could call into question whether, and to what extent, the laws of any particular
jurisdiction should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Note Guarantees and the
Transaction Security Documents in these jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive.

**_The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent, rather than directly to the holders_**
**_of the Notes. The ability of the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable, to enforce the Collateral may be_**
**_restricted by local law._**

The security interests that will secure the obligations of each Issuer under the Notes and the obligations of
the Guarantors under the Note Guarantees thereof will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but to
the Security Agent and thus the holders of the Notes will not have any independent power to enforce, or have
recourse to, any of the Transaction Security Documents or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the
Transaction Security Documents except through the Security Agent, including as may be provided in the
Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting a Note, you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a
result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against us in the event of
a default. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.”

In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests in the Collateral is subject to
mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over such Collateral are taken,
including Italian law, as applicable. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for the
appropriation of certain pledged assets but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods
may apply. There is some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to
beneficial owners of the Notes that are not identified as registered holders in, nor are directly parties to, a
Transaction Security Document will be validly secured. This area of law is untested in the courts of Italy. In
certain jurisdictions, including France, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and
perfection of security interests and the enforceability of such security interests, the Intercreditor Agreement will
provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the relevant Security Agent (“Parallel Debt”)
mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and of each of the Guarantors owed to holders of the Notes under or in
connection with the Indenture (“Principal Obligations”), but in jurisdictions such as Italy where the case law does
not currently provide for their application, these Parallel Debt provisions would not be applicable. All or part of
the pledges and other security interests in such jurisdictions will be granted to the Security Agent as security
interests for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the Principal Obligations. Under the provisions of the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Parallel Debt will be at all times in the same amount and payable at the same time
as the Principal Obligations and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the

60


-----

corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding
Principal Obligations. In respect of the security interests granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the
Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such
security interests except through the relevant Security Agent. Therefore, the holders of the Notes will bear the
risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of the relevant Security Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt construct in
financing transactions, including credit facilities and bond issuances, has not been tested under law in certain of
these jurisdictions (including Italy) and to the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created under the
Parallel Debt construct are not validly granted, are unenforceable or are successfully challenged by other parties,
holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of such security interests in the
Collateral. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the
_Note Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

For example, the Collateral governed by the laws of Italy will not be granted directly to the holders of the
Notes but will be created and perfected in favor of the Security Agent, acting also in its capacity as representative
(rappresentante) of the holder of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code.
Under such provision (introduced by Italian Law No. 164 of November 11, 2014), the security interests and
guarantees assisting bond issuances can be validly created in favor of an agent (rappresentante) of the holders of
the Notes who will then be entitled to exercise in the name and on behalf of the holders all their rights (including
any rights before any court and judicial proceedings) relating to the security interests and guarantees. However,
there is no guidance or available case law on the exercise of the rights and enforcement of such security interest
and guarantee by a rappresentante pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code also in the
name and on behalf of the holders of the Notes which are neither directly parties to the Collateral nor are
specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries.
Furthermore, it is untested in Italian courts whether guarantees and security interests can effectively be granted in
favor of an entity acting as “rappresentante” of the noteholders pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the
Italian Civil Code in connection with notes issued by an entity incorporated outside of Italy and absent a
resolution by the competent corporate body of the foreign issuer appointing a notary to carry out any formality
required under the laws of Italy for the creation of security interests.

The enforcement of any Collateral located in Italy or governed by Italian law is subject to mandatory
provisions of Italian law, including in relation to limitations and defenses or to limitations contained in the terms
of the Security Documents designed to ensure compliance with applicable statutory requirements.

For a more detailed description of various limitations on the security under Italian law, see “Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and_
_the Security Interests—Italy.”_

**_Rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly
perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party or the grantor of the
security, as applicable. The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the
claims of the Notes if we fail or are unable to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens. Any failure
to perfect any security interest in the Collateral may result in the invalidity of the relevant security interest or
adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties, including a trustee
in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Collateral. Neither the Trustee nor the
Security Agent will be under any obligation or responsibility to take any steps or action to perfect, or ensure the
perfection of, any such liens. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

**_There are circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral_**
**_securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be released automatically without your consent or the_**
**_Trustee or the Security Agent obtaining your further consent._**

Under a variety of circumstances, the Collateral securing the Notes will be released automatically, including
a sale, transfer or other disposal of such Collateral in a transaction that does not violate the asset sale covenant of
the Indenture and in connection with an enforcement sale permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement. The
Indenture will also permit us to designate one or more restricted subsidiaries that are Guarantors as unrestricted
subsidiaries. If we designate a Guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture, all of the
liens on the Collateral owned by such subsidiary and any Note Guarantees by such subsidiary will be released

61


-----

under the Indenture, subject to certain conditions. Designation of an unrestricted subsidiary as such will reduce
the aggregate value of the Collateral securing the Notes to the extent of liens securing the shares of such
unrestricted subsidiary or of its subsidiaries.

Under various circumstances, the Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will be released, including pursuant to the
provisions described under “Description of the Notes—IPO Debt Pushdown.”

**_The Notes and the Note Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the claims of creditors, including_**
**_depositors, trade creditors and preferred stockholders (if any), of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries._**

Generally, claims of creditors, including depositors, trade creditors and preferred stockholders (if any) of
non-Guarantor subsidiaries of the Issuer, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such
subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to their respective parent entity or the creditors
of the Issuer and the Guarantors. Accordingly, in the event that any non-Guarantor subsidiary of the Issuer
becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a
solvent transaction:

   - the creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors (including the holders of the Notes) will have no right to
proceed against the assets of such non-Guarantor subsidiary; and

   - creditors of such non-Guarantor subsidiary, including depositors, trade creditors and preferred
stockholders (if any) will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the
assets of such subsidiary before the Issuer or any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder (as
applicable), will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary.

As such, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the creditors, including
depositors, trade creditors and any preferred stockholders (if any) of the non-Guarantor subsidiaries of the Issuer.
In addition, the Indenture will, subject to certain limitations, permit these non-Guarantor subsidiaries to incur
substantial additional indebtedness without such incurrence constituting a default under the Indenture, and such
indebtedness may also be secured. The Indenture will not contain any limitation on the amount of other
liabilities, such as deposits and trade payables, that may be incurred by these subsidiaries.

**_The insolvency laws of Finland and other applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable to you as the_**
**_insolvency laws of the United States or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other_**
**_limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests (as defined herein), including fraudulent_**
**_conveyance statutes, may adversely affect their validity and enforceability._**

On and after the Issue Date or 120 days from the Business Day after the Squeeze-Out Completion Date, as
applicable, our obligations under the Notes will be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantors and secured by security
interests over the relevant Collateral (the “Security Interests”). The Issuer is organized under the laws of Finland;
and the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Finland, France, Italy and the United States. With respect to
the Issuer and any Guarantor organized under the laws of a member state of the European Union, there is a
rebuttable presumption that the “centre of main interest” as defined in the Council of the European Union
Regulation No. 2015/848 on Insolvency Proceedings is the jurisdiction where the registered office is situated. In
addition, the Collateral will include a pledge over the shares in certain of the Group’s subsidiaries incorporated
under the laws of Finland, France, Italy and the United States and security interests in certain present and future
intercompany loan receivables held by the Issuer and certain of the Group’s subsidiaries incorporated under the
laws of Finland, France, Italy and the United States.

The insolvency laws of foreign jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as the laws of the
United States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer,
the Guarantors or any other of the Issuer’s subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to
predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be
commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings.

Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and
equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in
such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes against the Issuer, the enforceability of a Note
Guarantee against any of the Guarantors and the enforceability of the Security Interests. In certain circumstances
the court may also void the Security Interest or the Note Guarantee if the company is close to or near insolvency.
The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes
generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer
and insolvency statutes.

62


-----

In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or the appointed insolvency
administrator may challenge the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests, and intercompany obligations
generally, as preferences, transaction at an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on
other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to:

   - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Note Guarantee or the
Security Interests provided by such security provider;

   - direct that the Issuer and the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Note Guarantee or
any Security Interest to the relevant Guarantor or security provider or to a fund for the benefit of the
Guarantor’s or security provider’s creditors; and

   - take other action that is detrimental to you.

If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Note Guarantee or Security Interest is found to
be a preference, transaction at an undervalue, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we
cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the
liability of each Guarantor or security provider under its Note Guarantee or the Security Interests will be limited
to the amount that will result in such guarantee or Security Interests not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or
improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. The amount recoverable from the Guarantors and
security providers under the Transaction Security Documents will also be limited. However, there can be no
assurance as to what standard a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each of
the Guarantors or security providers under its Note Guarantee or the Security Interests, as applicable. There is
also the possibility that the entire Note Guarantee or Security Interest may be set aside, in which case the entire
liability may be extinguished. See also “Risk _Factors—Risks_ _Related_ _to_ _the_ _Notes_ _and_ _Our_
_Structure—Limitations to the Guarantees and Collateral”, “—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws,_
_capital maintenance and other limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the_
_validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral.”_

In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts would,
for example, need to find that, at the time the Note Guarantees were issued, or the Security Interests created, the
relevant Guarantor or security provider:

   - issued such Note Guarantee or created such Security Interest with the intent of hindering, delaying or
defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or created
such security after its insolvency;

   - issued such Note Guarantee or created such Security Interest in a situation where a prudent business
person as a shareholder of such Guarantor or security provider would have contributed equity to such
Guarantor or security provider or where the relevant beneficiary of the Note Guarantee or Security
Interest knew or should have known that the Guarantor or security provider was insolvent or a filing for
insolvency had been made; or

   - received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Note Guarantee
or Security Interest on the basis that the Note Guarantee or Security Interest were incurred for our
benefit, and only indirectly the Guarantor’s or security provider’s benefit, or on some other basis and
(i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Note Guarantee or the creation
of the Security Interest, or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons; (ii) was engaged, or was
about to engage, in a business transaction for which the Guarantor’s or security provider’s assets were
unreasonably small; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to
make required payments as and when they would become due.

Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor or security provider generally
may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Note Guarantee or created any
Security Interest if:

   - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets;

   - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due;

   - the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts and
liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute; or

   - its liabilities exceed the liquidation value of its assets, unless it has a positive going concern prognosis.

63


-----

Although we believe that the Issuer and the other Guarantors are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to
the Transactions, there can be no assurance as to which standard a court would apply in determining whether a
Guarantor or security provider was “insolvent” as of the date the Note Guarantees were issued or the Security
Interests were created or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor
or security provider was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not
a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on the date its Note Guarantee was issued or the Security Interests
were created, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

For an overview of certain insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the Note Guarantees
and Security Interests, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure—Limitations to the
_Guarantees and Collateral” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and_
_Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

**_Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Note_**
**_Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and_**
**_the Collateral._**

The Original Guarantor and the other subsidiaries of the Issuer that are expected to provide a Note
Guarantee are organized under the laws of Finland, France, Italy and the United States. Enforcement of the
obligations under a Note Guarantee against, and/or any security provided by, as applicable, any such Guarantor
will be subject to certain defenses available to the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be. These
laws and defenses may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance, corporate benefit,
capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or similar laws as well as regulations or defenses affecting the rights
of creditors generally, particularly by limiting the amounts recoverable under the Note Guarantees and Collateral,
as applicable, and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited to the maximum amount that can be
guaranteed or secured by a particular Guarantor or security provider under the applicable laws of each
jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Note Guarantee or Collateral is not in the relevant Guarantor’s
or security provider’s corporate interests, or the burden of such Note Guarantee or Collateral exceeds the benefit
to the relevant Guarantor or security provider, or such Note Guarantee or Collateral would be in breach of capital
maintenance, liquidity maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws and/or would
cause the directors of such subsidiary Guarantor or security provider to contravene their fiduciary duties and
incur civil or criminal liability.

As a result, the relevant Guarantor’s or security provider’s liability under its Note Guarantee or Collateral
could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending upon the law and contractual enforcement restrictions
applicable to it. This could lead to a situation in which such Note Guarantee or Collateral cannot be enforced at
all. It is possible that a Guarantor or security provider, or any of their creditors, or the bankruptcy trustee or other
insolvency office holder in the case of a bankruptcy or insolvency of a Guarantor or security provider, may
contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor’s Note Guarantee or the security provider’s Collateral on
any of the above grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Note Guarantee or Collateral
should be limited or voided. To the extent that any limitations on the relevant Note Guarantees or Collateral
apply, the Notes would be to that extent effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor or
security provider, including trade payables of such Guarantor or security provider. Future Note Guarantees and
Collateral may be subject to similar limitations.

Specifically, as a result of the applicable limitations under Italian law with respect to, amongst others,
financial assistance and corporate benefit, notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the Indenture, the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement, as regards to any Guarantor
incorporated under the laws of Italy (an “Italian Guarantor”):

(i) the Guarantee and security interests granted by the relevant Italian Guarantor will only guarantee and
secure the Issuers’ obligations under Tranche B (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes and
shall not exceed at any time an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of any intercompany
loans or other financial support in any form (such term, for the avoidance of doubt, not including equity
contributions), advanced from time to time to such Italian Guarantor (or any of its direct or indirect
Subsidiaries pursuant to article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code) by the Issuer (whether directly or
indirectly) on or following the Issue Date and outstanding at the time of the enforcement of the relevant
guarantee, in each case net of any proceeds already paid pursuant to the enforcement of its guarantee
under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and/or the Intercreditor Agreement and/or
received upon the enforcement of any security interests granted by the Italian Guarantor, and in

64


-----

any event subject to the Intercreditor Agreement provided that the Italian Guarantor shall not be liable
as a Guarantor in respect of any amounts in excess of the amount that such Italian Guarantor is entitled
to (and actually can) set-off against its claims of recourse or subrogation (regresso or surrogazione)
arising as a result of any payment made by such Italian Guarantor under its Guarantee;

(ii) the maximum amount guaranteed and/or secured by an Italian Guarantor, also in accordance with
article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code (where applicable), will not exceed the lower of (a) 120% of the
outstanding principal amount of the Notes, and (b) the aggregate amount of the original principal
amount of Tranche B (as defined in “Use of proceeds”) under the Notes, reduced, from time to time, by
an amount equal to any repayment, prepayment or redemption of the principal amount of the Notes
multiplied by the ratio of (A) the aggregate amount of the original principal amount of the Tranche B
(as defined in “Use of proceeds”) under the Notes to (B) the original principal amount of the Notes;

(iii) the aggregate amount of interest guaranteed and/or secured by an Italian Guarantor in respect of any
payment obligations under Tranche B under the Notes will be at any time equal to the interest then
outstanding in respect of a principal amount of Tranche B under the Notes at that time;

(iv) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Indenture, in order to comply with the mandatory
provisions of Italian law in relation to (a) maximum interest rates (including the Italian Usury Law and
article 1815 of the Italian Civil Code) and (b) capitalization of interests (including article 1283 of the
Italian Civil Code and article 120 of the Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of 1 September 1993), the
obligations of an Italian Guarantor under its Guarantee shall not include and shall not extend to (A) any
interest qualifying as usurious pursuant the Italian Usury Law and (B) any interest on overdue amounts
compounded in violation of the provisions set forth by article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and/or
article 120 of the Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of 1 September 1993, respectively; and

(v) any guarantee, indemnity, obligations and liability granted or assumed pursuant to the relevant Guarantee
and/or security interest by any Italian Guarantor does not (and will not) include and does not (and will
not) extend, directly or indirectly, to any amounts and/or payment obligations other than the amounts and/
or payment obligations under Tranche B (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes.

The abovementioned “virtual tranching” structure in respect of the Notes, which is aimed at identifying the
relevant portion of the Notes’ proceeds which does not constitute “acquisition debt” (or refinancing thereof) in
respect of any Italian Guarantor and, therefore, does not fall within the prohibition under Italian financial
assistance rules (namely, Article 2358 or 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code), is untested in Italian
courts and might be deemed insufficient to clearly distinguish and separate the non-acquisition portion of the
Notes’ proceeds from any portion of the Notes’ proceeds to be utilized to support the acquisition or subscription
by the Issuer of the share capital of, respectively, an Italian Guarantor or an entity directly or indirectly
controlling it and/or to repay existing debt originating from previous acquisition schemes and/or otherwise in
contravention of any provisions regulating financial assistance. Should the Guarantee and/or the security interests
and/or the indemnity granted and/or assumed by an Italian Guarantor be deemed by a court or public authority to
be contrary to any provisions regulating financial assistance, including Articles 2358 and 2474, as applicable, of
the Italian Civil Code, such Guarantee and/or security interests and/or indemnities as well as any other contract
entered in connection therewith, could be declared null and void and the Notes documents will provide that, if
and to the extent such Guarantee would result in a breach of any provisions regulating financial assistance,
including Articles 2358 and 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code, applicable to such Italian Guarantor,
such an Italian Guarantor will be deemed to have no liability thereunder and the Guarantee shall not be in force
and effect ab initio.

In addition, the obligations of any Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider that becomes a
Guarantor and/or a security provider will be subject to the Agreed Security Principles and will be subject to the
additional limitations set forth in the relevant supplemental indenture to the Indenture and/or in the applicable
security documents, in order for the applicable Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider to comply with
the above corporate law requirements on, among others, corporate benefit and financial assistance.

In any case, the maximum amount that an Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider, in each case,
may be required to pay in respect of its obligations as Guarantor under the Indenture and/or security grantor
under the relevant security documents upon enforcement of the security interests granted by such Italian
Guarantor will ratably concur and not cumulate with the corresponding amounts due by such Italian Guarantor
and/or Italian security provider to any guaranteed and/or secured creditor pursuant to the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities Agreement and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (including any guaranteed and/or secured creditors with

65


-----

respect to any further pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement) and/or any
security documents, and vice versa. For the avoidance of doubt, by virtue of the abovementioned limitations
applicable to the guarantees and the security interests granted by an Italian Guarantor, the obligations of each
Italian Guarantor as guarantor and/or security provider under the Notes, the Indenture, the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and any agreement regulating future pari passu indebtedness
contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement-the security documents relating to the Collateral and any other
transaction documents related thereto shall not be deemed to be cumulative and shall be considered without
duplication, and the transaction documents will provide that the aggregate amount of the proceeds deriving from
any enforcement of any such guarantee and/or security obligations of the relevant Italian Guarantor shall not
exceed on an aggregate basis the limit of the relevant Italian Guarantor’s credit support as described above.

In addition to the above, under article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a corporate guarantee is issued by a
Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Italy to guarantee conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must
be limited to a maximum amount. Such maximum amount should be expressly identified at the outset and
expressed in figures (either in the guarantee deed or by reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture).
It has been held that such determination must be proportionate to the relevant Guarantor’s assets. If such
determination is deemed disproportionate to the assets of each of the Guarantors, there is a risk that the guarantee
could be declared void.

The proceeds of the enforcement of said guarantees and/or security interests will be distributed amongst the
guaranteed and/or secured creditors (including, without, limitation, the holders of the Notes) in accordance with
the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Accordingly, the holders of the Notes will be able to recover
limited amounts under the relevant Note Guarantees and security. In particular, considering that the guaranteed
aggregate amount under its Guarantee and related security interests is capped to the amount of the intercompany
loans or other financial support in any form received after the Issue Date by the Italian Guarantor or its
Subsidiaries and subject to the relevant set off rights described above (which are aimed at avoiding duplications
of the exposure between the relevant intercompany loans or other financial support received and the exposure
under the Note Guarantee), that Note Guarantee and security interests would have a very limited or no value if no
such intercompany loans or other financial support were to be made available to such entities.

See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note
_Guarantees and the Security Interests” and, in particular, “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations And_
_Limitations On The Validity And Enforceability Of The Note Guarantees And The Security Interests—Italy—_
_Limitations to the Guarantees and Collateral”._

**_Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes._**

Because the Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been, and will not be, and are not required to be,
registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, they may not be offered
or sold in the United States except to QIBs in accordance with Rule 144A, to non-U.S. persons in offshore
transactions in accordance with Regulation S or pursuant to another exemption from, or in a transaction not
subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and all other applicable laws. These
restrictions may limit the ability of investors to resell the Notes. It is the obligation of investors in the Notes to
ensure that all offers, and sales of the Notes in the United States and other countries comply with applicable
securities laws. See “Notice to Investors.”

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form and therefore investors must rely on the procedures of the_**
**_relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable.

Interests in the global notes representing the Notes will trade in book-entry form only, and Notes in
definitive registered form, or Definitive Registered Notes (as defined herein), will be issued in exchange for
book-entry interests only in very limited circumstances. Owners of book-entry interests will not be considered
owners or holders of Notes. The custodian for DTC or common depositary, or its nominee, for Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable, will be the registered holders of the global notes representing the Notes. Payments of
principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the global notes representing the Notes will be
made to the applicable Paying Agent, which will make payments to DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in
the global Notes representing the Notes and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment

-----

to the custodian for DTC or the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, the Issuer will
have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of bookentry interests. Accordingly, if investors own a book-entry interest, they must rely on the procedures of DTC or
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, and if investors are not participants in DTC or Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable, they must rely on the procedures of the participant through which they own their
interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes under the Indenture.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to
act upon the Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes.
Instead, if an investor owns a book-entry interest, it will be permitted to act only to the extent it has received
appropriate proxies to do so from DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable. The procedures
implemented for the granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable such investor to vote on a timely
basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until Definitive
Registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if investors own book-entry interests, they will
be restricted to acting through DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable. The procedures to be
implemented through DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream may not be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of
rights under the Notes. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.”

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes will be_**
**_limited._**

We cannot assure you as to:

   - the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

   - your ability to sell your Notes; or

   - the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices of the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing
interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. The liquidity of a trading market for the
Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities. Historically, the market
for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the
prices of securities similar to the Notes. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of
Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. The Initial Purchasers have advised that they
intend to make a market in the Notes after completing the Offering. However, they have no obligation to do so
and may discontinue market making activities at any time without notice. In addition, such market making
activity will be subject to limitations imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and other applicable laws and
regulations. As a result, there may not be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market
develops, you may not be able to resell your Notes at a fair value, if at all.

**_Investors may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuer and its subsidiaries in Finland, France and Italy that, subject to and in accordance with the
Agreed Security Principles and to certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, are expected to
provide a Note Guarantee (together, the “Non-U.S. Obligors”) are organized or incorporated outside the United
States, and their business is substantially conducted outside the United States. The directors and executive
officers of the Non-U.S. Obligors are non-residents of, and substantially all of their assets are located outside of,
the United States. Although the Non-U.S. Obligors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in
connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the
United States on the directors and executive officers of Non-U.S. Obligors. In addition, as a substantial portion of
the assets of the Non-U.S. Obligors and their subsidiaries and those of their directors and executive officers are
located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce against them judgments obtained in U.S.
courts. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Non-U.S. Obligors may
not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States.

Additionally, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of foreign jurisdictions would enforce
(i) judgments of United States courts obtained against the Non-U.S. Obligors and the directors and executive
officers who are not residents of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the United
States federal and state securities laws or (ii) in original actions brought in such foreign jurisdictions against us or
such persons predicated upon the United States federal and state securities laws.

The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of
judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters, with France, Finland and Italy.

**_The Issuer may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. In addition, under certain_**
**_circumstances, the Issuer may have the right to purchase all outstanding Notes in connection with a tender_**
**_offer, even if certain holders of the Notes do not consent to the tender offer._**

If a Change of Control (as defined in the Indenture) occurs, the Issuer will be required to make an offer to
purchase all the outstanding respective Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus any
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase. In such a
situation, the Issuer may not have enough funds to pay for all of the Notes that are tendered under any such offer.
If a significant principal amount of Notes is tendered, the Issuer will likely have to obtain financing to pay for the
tendered Notes. However, the Issuer may not be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms, if at all. A
change of control would entitle each lender under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement (individually)
to cancel its commitments and require prepayment of amounts outstanding to it under the Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement and could trigger put rights, mandatory prepayments or accelerations under other existing or future
financing arrangements of the Group. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes upon a change of
control would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities Agreement.

The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the
event of certain important corporate events, including reorganizations, restructurings, mergers, recapitalizations
or other similar transactions involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not
involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a change of control
as defined in the Indenture. Furthermore, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a
change of control under the Indenture will be deemed not to be a change of control if a specified consolidated net
leverage ratio is met. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.”

In addition, in connection with certain tender offers for the Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in
aggregate principal amount of the applicable outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in
such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases, all
of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right
to redeem the Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price equal to
the price offered to each other holder of Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption—General.”

**_The term “all or substantially all” in the context of a change of control has no clearly established meaning_**
**_under relevant law and is subject to judicial interpretation such that it may not be certain that a change of_**
**_control has occurred or will occur._**

Upon the occurrence of a transaction that constitutes a change of control under the Indenture, the Issuer will
be required to make an offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes tendered. The definition of “change of control”
in the Indenture will include (with certain exceptions) a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries (taken as a whole), to any person. Although there is a limited body of case
law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” it has no clearly established meaning under relevant law,
varies according to the facts and circumstances of the subject transaction and is subject to judicial interpretation.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty in ascertaining whether a particular
transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of a person, and therefore it may
be unclear whether a change of control has occurred and whether the relevant Issuer is required to make an offer
to repurchase the Notes.

**_We may dispose of certain assets or capital stock of entities in the Group._**

We may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings, or other transactions that, in our
judgment, would be beneficial to us, even if such transactions might involve risks to you as noteholders. For
example, pursuant to the asset disposition covenant and other provisions of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement and the Indenture, we may, under certain circumstances, sell, convey, transfer or otherwise dispose of
material assets of the Group and, if meeting certain leverage ratios on an as adjusted basis or otherwise having
restricted payments capacity, distribute some or all of the proceeds therefrom to our shareholders. Such a
transaction would not constitute a change of control or a default under the terms of the Notes. See “Description

68


-----

_of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments.” Additionally, we may issue, sell transfer_
or otherwise dispose of the capital stock of entities in the Group for purposes of taking a dividend or distribution
that would benefit us but not benefit you as the noteholders.

**_Holders of the Notes may have adverse tax consequences in the event of an IPO Debt Pushdown._**

Under certain circumstances, we may undertake an IPO Debt Pushdown (as described in “Description of the
_Notes—IPO Debt Pushdown”), pursuant to which the Issuer is entitled to give notice that the terms of the_
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined in
“Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements”)) will automatically
operate so that, among other things, the references to the Issuer and Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in
“Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions”) (and all related provisions) shall apply only to the IPO
Pushdown Entity (as defined in “Description of the Notes—IPO Debt Pushdown”) and its Restricted Subsidiaries.
In such event, each holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity would be released from its obligations under
the Indenture.

Such modifications to the terms of the Notes could be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a
deemed exchange of (i) the Notes as in place prior to such modifications for (ii) new Notes as in place after such
modifications (the “New Notes”). If such modifications result in a deemed exchange for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, it would generally be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes in which
beneficial owners of the Notes would be required to recognize any gain or loss. Furthermore, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, the New Notes deemed issued in such a deemed exchange could be treated as issued with
original issue discount. In such event, U.S. Holders (as defined under “Certain Taxation Considerations—
_Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”) would generally be required to include the original issue_
discount in their income (as ordinary income) as it accrues, in advance of the receipt of cash corresponding to
such income. In addition, the determination of whether the New Notes are treated as “contingent payment debt
instruments” as a result of the possibility of additional payments, as further described under “Certain Taxation
_Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations—Additional Payments,” would be made at the_
time of the modification. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the U.S. federal income tax
considerations relating to potential modifications of the Notes in connection with the IPO Debt Pushdown,
including the U.S. federal income tax considerations of a deemed exchange and resulting OID, if any.

It is also possible that the IPO Debt Pushdown could result in a taxable event for tax purposes other than
U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**_Certain covenants and events of default will be suspended if we receive investment grade ratings._**

The Indenture will provide that, if at any time following the date of the Indenture, the Notes issued under
such Indenture receive any two of the following ratings: Baa3 or higher from Moody’s, BBB- or higher from
S&P or BBB- or higher from Fitch, and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, then
beginning that day and continuing until such time as such Notes are no longer rated investment grade by either
rating agency, certain covenants will cease to be applicable to such Notes. See “Description of the Notes—
_Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status.” At any time when_
these covenants are suspended, we will be able to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, pay cash
dividends and redeem subordinated indebtedness without restriction, each of which may conflict with the
interests of holders of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve an investment grade
rating or that any such rating if achieved will be maintained.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject_**
**_to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The credit ratings
address our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks in determining the
likelihood that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential
impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed above and other factors that
may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may
be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurances can be given
that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or
withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A
suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the
credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could
adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.

69


-----

**_The Notes may not become or remain listed on the Exchange._**

Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited for the listing of and
permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange. However, there can be no assurance that the
Notes will become or remain listed. If the Issuer cannot maintain the listing on the Exchange and the admission
to dealing on the Official List thereof, or if it becomes unduly burdensome to make or maintain such listing, the
Issuer may cease to make or maintain such listing on the Official List of the Exchange. Listing of any of the
Notes on the Exchange does not imply that a public offering of any of the Notes in the Channel Islands or the Isle
of Man has been authorized. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of listing
on the Official List of the Exchange or another recognized listing exchange for comparable issuers, failure to be
approved for listing of the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange or another recognized listing exchange or
the delisting of the Notes from the Official List of the Exchange or another listing exchange may have an adverse
effect on a holder’s ability to resell Notes in the secondary market.

**_You may face foreign currency exchange as a result of investing in the Notes._**

The EUR Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If you are a U.S. investor, an investment in the
EUR Notes will entail foreign exchange related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in
the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar because of economic, political and other factors over which we
have no control. Depreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar could cause a decrease in the effective yield of
the EUR Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to you on a U.S. dollar basis.
Investments in the notes by U.S. investors may also have important tax consequences as a result of foreign
exchange gains, if any. The Indenture will not be qualified under the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as
amended.

The Indenture will not be required to, and will not be, qualified under the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939,
as amended (the “TIA”) and will not incorporate or include and will not be subject to any of the provisions of the
TIA. Consequently, the holders of Notes will not be entitled to the protections provided under the TIA to holders
of debt securities issued under a qualified indenture, including those respecting preferential collections by the
trustee or conflicting interests of the trustee. See “Description of the Notes.”

**_The Notes may be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**

If the stated principal amount of the Notes exceeds their issue price by an amount greater than or equal to a
statutorily defined de minimis amount, then the Notes will be considered to be issued with original issue discount
(“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, although it is expected that the Notes will be issued without
original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the Notes are issued with OID, then, in addition to
the stated interest on a note, a U.S. investor would generally be required to include such OID in gross income (as
ordinary income) as it accrues on a constant yield basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes in advance of the
receipt of cash payments to which such income is attributable and regardless of the holder’s method of
accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**The Transactions**

**_The Acquisitions_**

_The Tender Offer_

On September 24, 2020, the Issuer and Ahlstrom-Munksjö entered into the Combination Agreement,
pursuant to which the Issuer announced a voluntary public cash tender offer with an offer price of €18.10 in cash
for each share validly tendered (the “Initially Announced Offer Price”) for all of the issued and outstanding
shares in Ahlstrom-Munksjö that are not held by Ahlstrom-Munksjö and its subsidiaries (the “Company Shares”
and the offer, the “Tender Offer”). The completion of the Tender Offer was subject to satisfaction of certain
conditions, including acceptance of the Tender Offer by shareholders holding more than 90% (on a fully diluted
basis) of the Company Shares and voting rights carried by the Company Shares, calculated in accordance with
applicable Finnish laws governing the right to commence compulsory squeeze-out proceedings (the “Minimum
Acceptance Condition”), together with any Company Shares otherwise held by the Issuer prior to the date of the
announcement of the final result of the Tender Offer. The Board of Directors of Ahlstrom-Munksjö, represented
by a quorum comprising the non-conflicted members of the Board of Directors, unanimously recommended that
the shareholders of Ahlstrom-Munksjö accept the Tender Offer. The Initially Announced Offer Price was
subsequently adjusted first to €17.97 per share and then to €17.84 per share (the “Tender Offer Price”) in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer, to account for two payments of dividend by the
Board of Directors of Ahlstrom-Munksjö after the Tender Offer was announced.

On January 15, 2021, the preliminary results of the Tender Offer were announced. The 50,386,853
Company Shares tendered in the Tender Offer, together with the total of 345,524 Company Shares acquired by
the Issuer through market purchases and the Company Shares which were to be received by Ahlstrom Invest
from the internal reorganization involving certain Ahlström family members and certain related entities and
which Ahlstrom Invest B.V. had undertaken to tender into the Tender Offer, represented approximately 81.1% of
all the Company Shares and voting rights carried by the Company Shares in Ahlstrom-Munksjö. On January 18,
2021, the Issuer announced that on the basis of the preliminary results of the Tender Offer, it decided to waive
the Minimum Acceptance Condition and complete the Tender Offer in accordance with its terms and conditions
provided that the final result of the Tender Offer confirmed that the Tender Offer had been validly accepted by
shareholders holding at least 75% (on a fully diluted basis) of the Company Shares and voting rights carried by
the Company Shares, calculated in accordance with Chapter 18, Section 1 of the Finnish Companies Act.

When the final result of the initial offer period under the Tender Offer was published on January 20, 2021,
the Company Shares validly tendered and accepted in the Tender Offer (including the Company Shares received
by Ahlstrom Invest B.V. as a result of the internal reorganization involving certain Ahlström family members
and certain related entities), together with the Company Shares acquired by the Issuer through market purchases,
represented approximately 81.0 % of all the Company Shares and voting rights carried by the Company Shares.
As such, the Issuer announced that it would complete the Tender Offer as the Minimum Acceptance Condition
had been waived and all other conditions to completion were fulfilled. The Issuer also announced that it would
commence a subsequent offer period in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer (the
“Subsequent Offer Period”) in order to provide the remaining shareholders of Ahlstrom-Munksjö the opportunity
to accept the Tender Offer. On February 9, the Issuer announced the final result of the Subsequent Offer Period,
pursuant to which the Company Shares validly tendered and accepted during the Subsequent Offer Period,
together with the Company Shares validly tendered and accepted during the initial offer period (as extended) and
otherwise acquired by the Issuer through market purchases until February 8, 2021, represented approximately
90.6 per cent of all the Company Shares and voting rights carried by the Company Shares.

On February 4, 2021 (the “Initial Settlement Date”), the first settlement under the Tender Offer occurred
with respect to Company Shares registered with Euroclear Finland Oy and on February 5, 2021 with respect to
Company Shares registered with Euroclear Sweden AB, and the Issuer acquired approximately 81.0% of the
Company Shares. On February 10, 2021 (the “Second Settlement Date”), the second settlement under the Tender
Offer occurred with respect to Company Shares registered with Euroclear Finland Oy and on February 11, 2021
with respect to Company Shares registered with Euroclear Sweden AB, and the Issuer acquired an additional
9.6% of the Company Shares. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Issuer owned approximately
90.6% of the Company Shares.

_The Squeeze-Out_

Under Chapter 18, Section 1 of the Finnish Companies Act, a shareholder holding more than nine-tenths of
the total number of shares and voting rights in a limited liability company has the right to redeem and, subject to
a demand by other shareholders, is also obligated to redeem the shares owned by the other shareholders in a
company at a fair price. The shares held by the company or its subsidiaries are not taken into account when
calculating the aggregate number of the shares and voting rights for the purposes of said Section.

The Issuer has on February 11, 2021 notified Ahlstrom-Munksjö of its decision to exercise its redemption
right pursuant to the Finnish Companies Act and to redeem all the Company Shares held by any other remaining
shareholders in Ahlstrom-Munksjö. To implement the redemption of the remaining Company Shares, the Issuer
has filed an application to initiate arbitration proceedings as provided in the Finnish Companies Act. In the
redemption proceedings, the Issuer will seek a redemption price of €17.84 per Share for the remaining Company
Shares, which corresponds to the Tender Offer Price. The arbitral tribunal will determine the timing of the
redemption proceedings and eventually decide on the redemption price payable by the Issuer for the remaining
Company Shares. The Issuer intends to apply for the delisting of the Company Shares from Nasdaq Helsinki Ltd
and Nasdaq Stockholm AB as soon as permitted and reasonably practicable under applicable laws and
regulations and the rules of said stock exchanges.

Following the completion of the Squeeze-Out, we may undertake certain reorganizations of members of the
Group located in Sweden, France or Italy.

_Sources and Uses for the Acquisitions_

The funding sources for the Acquisitions (excluding the Squeeze-Out), the repayment or refinancing of the
Existing Senior Unsecured Notes, the Hybrid Bond and certain existing bank loans or other debt (excluding the
Pension Loan, local lines, leases and other debt and bank loans being rolled over), the dividend held at the Issuer
in respect of the Pref Instrument, the payment of related fees and expenses and other costs related to the
Transactions consist of proceeds from the following sources:

   - equity contributions from the Sponsors in the form of subscription to ordinary equity shares equaling
approximately €1,120.9 million contributed to the Issuer through intermediate holding companies (the
“Equity Contributions”) and the dividend on open market purchases;

   - drawings under the Senior Term Facilities in an aggregate amount of up to €650.0 million (equivalent)
and drawings under the Bridge Facilities that will be refinanced using the proceeds from the offering of
the Notes (see “—The Refinancing” below);

   - cash on hand and dividends paid on the shares acquired through open market purchases after the tender
offer was announced.

The notional sources and uses necessary to consummate the Acquisitions (excluding the Squeeze-Out), to
repay or refinance the Existing Senior Unsecured Notes, the Hybrid Bond and certain existing bank loans or
other debt (excluding the Pension Loan, local lines, leases and other debt and bank loans being rolled over) and
for the other uses in connection with the Transactions as described above are shown in the table below. Both the
funding sources described above and the sources and uses shown below gives effect to the refinancing of the debt
that is expected to be refinanced in connection with the Transactions and the Hybrid Bond, but does not give
effect to the Squeeze-Out. See “Capitalization” and “Description of Other Indebtedness—Existing Debt.” Actual
amounts will vary from the notional amounts presented here depending on several factors, including, among
others, those described above, the respective dates of redemption or repayment of the Bridge Facilities, the other
existing debt expected to be refinanced in connection with the Transactions or the Hybrid Bond and differences
from our estimates of fees and expenses.

(1) Represents the equity contributions contributed by the Sponsors in connection with the Transactions, including the proceeds of the Pref
Instrument that were contributed to the Issuer in the form of subscription to ordinary equity shares by Finnish Midco. See “—Summary
_Corporate and Financing Structure.”_

(2) The drawings under the Bridge Facilities, together with the other cash sources as described herein, were used in connection with the
acquisition of Company Shares on the Initial Settlement Date and were used, or will be used, in connection with, the payment of the
Existing Senior Unsecured Notes, the Hybrid Bond and certain existing bank loans (excluding the Pension Loan, local lines, leases and
other bank loans being rolled over) and for other costs in connection with the Transactions. The proceeds from the offering of the Notes

Memorandum, and the U.S. dollar-denominated USD TLB Facility in an initial principal amount of $547,000,000 (€450,000,000
equivalent), of which $363,702,000 was drawn as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement also provides for the Revolving Credit Facility in an amount of €325 million (equivalent). See “Capitalization.”

(4) Represents cash on the balance sheet used or expected to be used in connection with the Transactions and the dividends on Company
Shares purchased by the Issuer or its affiliates on the open market paid on October 9, 2020 and January 11, 2021.

interest, break costs and other fees and refinancing costs) expected to be repaid or refinanced in connection with the Transactions and
excluding the Pension Loan, local lines, leases and other bank loans being rolled over. See “Capitalization” and “Description of Other
_Indebtedness—Existing Debt.”_

(6) Represents the aggregate purchase price of the Company Shares acquired by the Issuer as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. As
of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Issuer has acquired 90.6%, of the Company Shares. The Issuer has filed an application to
initiate arbitration proceedings as provided in the Finnish Companies Act, upon the completion of which, it will own 100.0% of the
Company Shares. These proceedings typically take approximately eight to twelve months to complete but advance title to the minority
shares may, subject to the discretion of the arbitral tribunal, under the proceedings often be obtained in approximately four to six months
against the placing of a security. While the Issuer has initiated the proceedings on the basis of the Tender Offer Price, the price of the
Company Shares acquired in the Squeeze-Out could be in excess of the Tender Offer Price. The price of the Company Shares to be paid
in connection with the Squeeze-Out will be funded using sources of cash available to the Issuer at such time. See “Summary—The
_Transactions—The Acquisitions—The Squeeze-Out.”_

(7) Represents amounts deposited into the escrow account for the purposes of making payments on the Pref Equity instrument.

(8) Represents cash overfunding in connection with the transaction and includes approximately €29.6 million of cash and cash equivalents
required to be held in Brazil, South Korea, China, India and Indonesia.

(9) Represents estimated fees and expenses associated with the Transaction, including commitment, underwriting, arranging, placement,
original issue discount, financial advisory, legal, accounting, ratings advisory and other transaction costs and professional fees. These
fees and expenses have been estimated as of the date of this Offering Memorandum and are subject to change. Additional fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the Refinancing are not included. See “—The Refinancing” and “Use of Proceeds.”

_The Refinancing_

In connection with the Acquisitions, the Issuer entered into the Bridge Facilities Agreements, which provide
for the EUR Bridge Facility in an aggregate principal amount of €600,000,000 and the USD Bridge Facility in an
aggregate principal amount of $484,936,000. The Issuer used, or will use, the proceeds from the Bridge
Facilities, the Equity Contributions from the Sponsors and drawings under the Senior Term Facilities, to finance
its acquisition of the Company Shares offered pursuant to the Tender Offer, to prepay or redeem the Existing
Senior Unsecured Notes, the Hybrid Bond and certain existing bank loans (excluding the Pension Loan, local
lines, leases and other bank loans being rolled over), to pay certain costs and expenses and for the other uses as
described under “—The Acquisitions—Sources and Uses for the Acquisitions.” See also “Use of Proceeds.”

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We estimate that the gross proceeds of the Offering of the Notes will be €650.0 million (equivalent). The
proceeds from the Offering, together with a portion of the proceeds from the Senior Term Facilities and cash on
hand, will be used by the Issuer to refinance the indebtedness outstanding under the Bridge Facilities and, in
particular:

   - approximately €274.6 million for the purposes of refinancing the proceeds of the Bridge Facilities
utilized to pay the purchase price of €1,859.6 of the Company Shares that have been acquired by the
Issuer as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, representing approximately 90.6% of the Company
Shares, (ii) pay costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Acquisitions and the other
transactions as described above, including legal, accounting, ratings advisory and other transaction
costs and professional fees, and (iii) pay costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
Offering representing all the proceeds from Tranche A (as defined below) under the Notes; and

   - approximately €375.4 million for the purposes of refinancing proceeds of the Bridge Facilities utilized
for the purposes of the repayment or refinancing of certain existing debt of the Group, representing all
the proceeds from Tranche B (as defined below) under the Notes.

For the avoidance of doubt, the “virtual tranching” of the Notes is aimed at identifying the separate portions
of the proceeds from the Offering to be used by the Issuer to refinance the proceeds under the Bridge Facilities
utilized for (i) payment of the purchase price of the Company Shares, (ii) payment of costs, fees and expenses
related to the Transactions and (iii) refinancing of repayment or refinancing certain existing debt of the Group
and will not entail issuing separate identifiers (ISINs or Common Codes) for each such virtual tranche under the
Notes. See “—The Acquisitions—Sources and Uses for the Acquisitions” and “Use of Proceeds.”
.

The estimated sources and uses necessary to consummate the Refinancing are shown in the table below.
Actual amounts will vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including the amount of interest
expense on the Bridge Facilities and differences from our estimates of fees and expenses. We present certain
amounts below translated to euros. You should not view such translations as representation that such euro
amounts actually represent such U.S. dollar amounts, or could be or could have been converted into U.S. dollars
at the rate indicated or at any other rate, on the Initial Settlement Date, the Issue Date or any other date. This
table should be read in conjunction with “Capitalization.”

(1) Represents the euro-equivalent amount of the expected proceeds of the offering of Notes hereby (assuming an issue price of par for both
series of Notes).

(2) Represents a portion of the gross proceeds from the Senior Term Facilities. The Senior Term Facilities include the euro-denominated
EUR TLB Facility in an initial principal amount of €550,000,000, of which €350,000,000 was drawn as of the date of this Offering
Memorandum, and the U.S. dollar-denominated USD TLB Facility in an initial principal amount of $547,000,000 (€450,000,000

proceeds from the Offering and cash on hand at the Issuer. As a result of such repayment, proceeds from a portion of the Notes
designated as Tranche A, equal to an aggregate principal amount of approximately €274.6 million (equivalent) will be used to:
(i) refinance the proceeds of the Bridge Facilities utilized for the acquisition of the Company Shares, (ii) refinance costs, fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the Acquisitions and the other transactions as described above, including legal, accounting, ratings
advisory and other transaction costs and professional fees, and (iii) pay the costs, fees, and expenses incurred in connection with the
Offering as described below in footnote (3) (“Tranche A”), and proceeds from a separate portion of the Notes designated as Tranche B,
equal to an aggregate principal amount of approximately €375.4 million (equivalent) will be used to refinance the proceeds of the Bridge
Facilities utilized to repay or refinance certain existing debt of the Group plus any break costs (“Tranche B”). Break costs are included in
the amount of transaction and other costs under “Summary—The Transactions—The Acquisitions—Sources and Uses for the
_Acquisitions” above. For more information on the Italian law considerations applicable to Tranche A and Tranche B and the related_
limitations on guarantees and security interests granted by Italian companies, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our

(4) Represents estimated fees and expenses associated with the Refinancing, including underwriting, placement, legal and other transaction
costs and professional fees to be financed with cash and/or a portion of the proceeds from virtual Tranche A under the Notes. See “—The
_Acquisitions—Sources and Uses for the Acquisitions.” These fees and expenses have been estimated as of the date of this Offering_
Memorandum and are subject to change. Refinancing costs exclude (i) accrued but unpaid interest on the Bridge Facilities, additional
expenses in connection with Transactions other than the Refinancing that were paid by the Issuer and Ahlstrom-Munksjo¨ as described
under “The Transactions—The Acquisitions—Sources and Uses for the Acquisitions” and (iii) any post-closing costs or expenses.

and cash equivalents reflects approximately €89.6 million of cash over-funding in connection with the Transactions (including
€30.0 million deposited into the escrow account for purposes of making payments on the Pref Equity) and reflects an adjustment of
approximately €258.3 million of cash used in connection with the acquisition by the Issuer of approximately 90.6% of the shares and the
other Transactions and assuming no other cash from the balance sheet will be required for the Transactions. The Issuer has filed an
application to initiate arbitration proceedings as provided in the Finnish Companies Act, upon the completion of which, it will own
100.0% of the Company Shares. While the Issuer has initiated the proceedings on the basis of the Tender Offer Price, the price of the
Company Shares acquired in the Squeeze-Out could be in excess of the Tender Offer Price. The price of the Company Shares to be paid
in connection with the Squeeze-Out will be funded using sources of cash available to the Issuer at such time. See “Summary—The
_Transactions—Sources and Uses for the Acquisitions” and “Use of Proceeds.” The actual amount of cash and cash equivalents as of the_
Issue Date may vary from this amount due to a number of factors.

(2) Represents the euro-equivalent of the indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Term Facilities. As of the date of this Offering
Memorandum, €650.0 million (equivalent) has been drawn under the Senior Term Facilities. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement also provides for a Revolving Credit Facility in an initial principal amount of €325.0 million of which approximately
€75.0 million has been utilized by way of ancillary facilities. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, there were no cash drawings
under the Revolving Credit Facility.

(3) Represents the euro-equivalent of the expected gross proceeds from the Notes offered hereby (assuming an issue price of par for both
series of Notes).

(4) Represents Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s existing debt comprising the aggregate principal amount outstanding of each of the Existing Senior

(5) Represents Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s Hybrid Bond, which is treated as equity in Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s consolidated financial statements
prepared in accordance with IFRS. The Issuer expects to redeem the Hybrid Bond within six months of the Initial Settlement Date. See

- On January 1, 2020, we changed the presentation format for our income statement to present it based on function of expense, instead of
nature of expense and to align with our internal reporting. In connection with the adoption of the function of expense method, certain
minor reclassifications of income statement items have been made, resulting in a decrease in net sales of €1.0 million and an increase in
other operating income of €8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. For more information on changes in income statement
presentation, see “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—The Issuer—Comparability of the Financial Statements—
_Presentation of Income Statement.”_

** We adopted IFRS 16 (Leases) as of January 1, 2019, using the simplified approach. Figures for the periods prior to January 1, 2019 have

**Overview**

We are a global leader in the production of high-performance fiber-based materials for a variety of
consumer and industrial end-uses. Our products are used in a broad range of industrial applications and
consumer-driven products and processes, ranging from everyday consumables, health care and life sciences,
homebuilding and furniture, industrial goods and transportation. Sustainability is central across our businesses,
and with our product offering we facilitate a sustainable everyday life by providing solutions with better
performance, safer materials, fewer resources and a lower environmental impact. Our net sales, operating result,
net result and Comparable EBITDA were €2,683.3 million, €176.2 million, €94.5 million and €334.2 million,
respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020 and our As Adjusted EBITDA was €412.6 million for the
year ended December 31, 2020.

We produce fiber-based materials from pulp and other fibers, and then typically sell such materials to
converters who incorporate them in their end-products. We also produce certain end-products ourselves. Our
product offering includes filter materials, release liners, food and beverage processing and packaging materials,
decor papers, abrasive and tape backings, electrotechnical insulation paper, glass fiber materials, medical fabrics
and solutions for diagnostics, and a range of other specialty materials and pulp for industrial and consumer
enduses. We develop our products in close cooperation with customers and other stakeholders in the value-chain,
making use of our high technical expertise and broad experience. We design our custom-made and tailored
materials with a high degree of differentiation to meet and exceed specific customer demands concerning quality
and functionality, adding value for customers.

We target niche markets that benefit from value-based pricing and require technical specialization making it
more challenging for new market entrants. As a niche player, identifying trends and developing new customer
solutions are critical for our business. We have a strong focus on innovation and aim to regularly refresh our
offering and to improve sustainable functionality and design. Our recent innovations include FortiCell® launched
in 2020, a new range of fiber-based solutions for energy storage applications using amongst others our DISPRO
foam-forming technology, Extia® Protect, a comprehensive range of materials for face masks using fine fiber
technology, and BioWeb® and Fiber+ ranges, which use renewable biopolymer polylactic acid for producing
biodegradable and compostable tea bag materials. Our sales from New Products increased to 12% for the year
ended December 31, 2020.

We serve a diverse customer base with more than 6,000 customers in over 100 countries. For the year ended
December 31, 2020, 37% of our sales were to customers in the consumer goods sector, 27% in the homebuilding
and furniture sector, 14% in the transportation sector, 11% in the industrials sector and 11% in the health care
and life sciences sector. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our top-five and top-ten largest customers
generated 13% and 19% of our net sales, respectively.

-----

We manufacture our products globally and have 45 manufacturing plants and converting sites in
14 countries. We consume commodity pulp as part of the manufacturing process. Our commodity pulp
consumption was approximately 1,200 thousand tons for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our pulp exposure
was reduced by approximately 500 thousand tons of our own pulp production during that same period, which
includes 185 thousand tons of market pulp production at our Aspa pulp mill in Sweden that is sold to third
parties. We believe that our global manufacturing footprint represents a competitive advantage and would be
challenging for new market entrants to replicate given its specification and scale. Our manufacturing sites are
equipped to provide and apply innovative technology, including FluoroFree® capabilities (providing grease
resistance without fluorochemicals), Parchmentizing technology (transforming cellulose to give it plastic-like
qualities) and fine fiber technology with multi-row spinning, which was recently adapted to also produce face
masks. We delivered a total of approximately 1,570 thousand tons of materials in the year ended December 31,
2020. We organize delivery of our products directly to many of our business-to-business customers using thirdparty transport service providers.

We were formed by the merger of Ahlstrom Corporation and Munksjö Oyj on April 1, 2017, which created
a global leader in the production of high-performance fiber-based materials. Our two predecessor companies
have a long history in the Finnish and Swedish forestry and paper industry. Since the merger, we have grown
significantly through the acquisitions of the Caieiras specialty paper mill in Brazil and Expera Specialty
Solutions in North America, each in October 2018.

**Our Business Areas**

On January 1, 2020, we implemented a new business structure to promote core business capabilities,
sharpen strategic targets and align the business characteristics of each business area. This structure has sixteen
businesses, which are organized into five business areas based on their core capabilities and characteristics to
strengthen synergies, and for reporting and governance purposes.

   - **Filtration & Performance Solutions: Filtration, Nonwovens, Glass Fiber Tissue, Abrasive**

   - **Advanced Solutions: Liquid Technologies, Beverage & Casing, Medical, Tape, Precision Coating**

   - **Industrial Solutions: Insulation, Release Liners, Coated Specialties**

   - **Food Packaging & Technical Solutions: Food Packaging, Technical, Parchment**

   - **Decor Solutions: Decor**

We believe that this change to our business areas was a natural next step following the initial integration
phase of the North America Specialty Solutions business area following the acquisition of Expera Specialty
Solutions. In the new structure, North America Specialty Solutions is integrated into the operating platform and
businesses are partly reorganized. Our Filtration & Performance Solutions and Advanced Solutions business
areas are focused on product development, and our Industrial Solutions and Food Packaging & Technical
Solutions business areas are focused on optimizing production. The Decor Solutions business area maintains its
single business focus, with the ambition to build a leading standalone global operation.

We evaluate the performance of each of these segments using key measures, such as net sales and
Comparable EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2020, excluding the impact of Other and eliminations,
Filtration & Performance Solutions comprised 23.4% of our net sales, Advanced Solutions comprised 17.5% of
our net sales, Industrial Solutions comprised 25.1% of our net sales, Food Packaging & Technical Solutions
comprised 20.4% of our net sales and Decor Solutions comprised 13.6% of our net sales. For further information
on our business areas for period prior to January 1, 2020, see “—Factors Affecting the Comparability of the
_Financial Statements—Changes to Reportable Segments” below._

We also report net sales across five regions and 12 geographies. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our
net sales were 43.2% in Europe, 34.7% in North America, 7.3% in South America, 13.3% in Asia-Pacific and
1.4% in the Rest of the World.

**Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition**

Our results of operations are affected by a combination of factors, including factors which are beyond our
control. We believe that our results of operations, and particularly the results of operations during the periods
under review, have been primarily affected by the following factors.

82


-----

**_Demand drivers_**

Most of our businesses hold a leading position in their strategic market segments. A majority also have a
global leadership position, while others hold positions as regional market leaders. All our businesses operate in
growing markets with solid demand drivers.

The accelerating pace of change demands readiness and the ability to adapt. Identifying the crucial factors
and trends and then making the right priorities in product development and corporate strategy is more important
than ever in the effort to maintain and strengthen competitiveness. Since we manage a broad platform of
businesses and serve a wide range of end uses, while our individual businesses may be impacted by individual
factors or trends, we are not likely to be significantly affected at a Group level.

_Filtration_

The Filtration business develops and produces high-performance filtration materials from natural or
synthetic fibers or a combination thereof for transportation applications, such as engine oils, fuels, air used in
vehicles as well as industrial applications such as heating, ventilation and air conditioning and air pollution
control. The Filtration business also produces and is further developing solutions for hybrid and fully electric
vehicles. In transportation applications, sales are primarily generated by the aftermarket. In industrial end-uses,
sales are primarily generated by indoor air and cleanroom applications and gas turbine air intake applications.
Demand in the Filtration business is driven by mileage, growing truck and passenger car fleets, as well as more
stringent emission regulations and air quality standards. In transportation, demand is also driven by new filter
applications in electrical mobility. The Filtration business has also utilized production lines for the production of
face mask materials as a result of high demand caused by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

_Nonwovens_

The Nonwovens business produces a wide range of nonwoven materials that are used for various
applications, including automotive interiors, plasterboards, hygiene, wallcover and wipes. The Nonwovens
business product range includes nonwovens backings, reinforcements and composite materials for automotive
interior, reinforcements for plasterboard, wetlaid specifically designed nonwovens for the apparel, fabric care,
hygiene, and wallcover markets, nonwovens for use as a base material for wound-care and wipes products. In the
construction industry, there has been growing demand for energy-efficient materials and technical plasterboard
solutions. We have also experienced a shift from paper to nonwoven wallcoverings, an increased use of
personalized design in high-end wallcoverings and a fast-growing digital print market. The Nonwovens business
is also driven in part by consumer spending.

_Glass Fiber Tissue_

The Glass Fiber Tissue business produces glass fiber tissue primarily for flooring applications, and a range
of building and transportation-related end-uses. Demand in the Glass Fiber Tissue business is driven by
construction and renovation activity. We have experienced a growing popularity of luxury vinyl tile flooring
solutions and an increase in the substitution from other flooring reinforcements such as mineral felt, especially in
North America.

_Abrasive_

The Abrasive business produces specialty papers used as backings for abrasive products used in industrial
and do-it-yourself sanding applications. Demand for abrasive products is driven by the automotive, wood,
furniture and construction industries. The Abrasive business also includes printing and surface treatment papers
for different backings. Demand for decorative printing and coating paper products is driven by interior designers.

_Medical_

The Medical business produces medical fabrics used in sterile barrier systems, drapes, gowns, facemasks
and sterilization wraps, all used primarily in surgery but also in cleanrooms and laboratories. Demand in the
Medical business is driven by the increase in high-risk surgeries, increasing liabilities related to infections and
contamination, rigorous regulatory requirements and the increasing use of single-use protection. In 2020, demand
for medical fabrics was fuelled by the COVID-19 pandemic.

83


-----

_Liquid Technologies_

The Liquid Technologies business produces high-quality filters for laboratory sample preparation and life
science diagnostics materials, used by laboratories and manufacturers of rapid test kits, in addition to highperformance filter media, an alternative to membrane technology, that has the ability to efficiently remove a wide
range of harmful contaminants for water purification devices. Other niches include hot cooking oil and milk
filtration applications. Demand in the Liquid Technologies business is driven by an increase in testing for
environmental and health monitoring. Consumers in the Liquid Technologies business seek patient-friendly
procedures that can be performed at home (or the point of care) and quick, cost-effective solutions for healthcare.
Demand is also driven by a desire for safer drinking water and rising quality standards for food and liquids. In
2020, diagnostics materials for rapid test kits and venting filters for devices used in the treatment of patients with
respiratory disorders were in strong demand.

_Beverage & Casing_

The Beverage & Casing business produces material for tea bags and coffee pods and casings, with a focus
on sustainability. Consumers are increasingly seeking sustainable alternatives. Demand is also driven by stricter
food safety and chemical regulations, and customer requests for more demanding packaging functionality and
barrier properties. In 2020, the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on quick service restaurants has been
offset by increased at-home consumption.

_Tape_

The Tape business produces tape backings to masking and packaging specialty tape manufacturers used in
the construction and automotive industries and packaging applications for e-commerce and for specialty
purposes. Demand in the Tape business is driven by home construction and renovation activity, growth in
automotive and electronics industries and growth in e-commerce. In 2020, regional lockdowns and limited
mobility for citizens increased demand for packaging-related tape backings.

_Precision Coating_

The Precision Coating business produces a variety of release liners for specialty markets, including fiber
composites, medical and tape. The business focuses on technically demanding applications that leverage the
integration of our business and our coating expertise. Precision Coating continues to expand its capabilities to
meet the stringent guidelines for the aerospace and medical markets as well as sustainable non-release products
for a range of markets. Demand in the Precision Coating business is driven by the aerospace industry, aging
population driving product development in advanced wound care, the increased use of self-adhesive fasteners in
industrial and home applications and sustainable solutions in coating and substrates, which are driving the next
generation of products. Non-aerospace markets are showing signs of recovery following the slowdown caused by
the COVID-19 pandemic.

_Release Liners_

The Release Liners business produces papers that, after the customer coats the product with silicone, can be
used to carry self-adhesive labels or for manufacturing and assembling adhesive materials and components in
industrial processes. E-commerce drives the need for labels in tracking and identification, which further
increased in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Demand in the Release Liners business is also driven
by the growing use of self-adhesive labels, fastening systems and carriers in industrial processes and the
consumption of packaged food and beverages. In 2020 demand for packaging-related release liner increased.

_Coated Specialties_

The Coated Specialties business manufactures coated label papers, flexible packaging papers for fastmoving consumables and processed foods, as well as office, printing and writing papers. Demand for coated
papers in the Coated Specialties business is driven by rapid urbanization increasing the need for packaging and
the expansion of e-commerce is increasing the need for labels. Consumers are increasingly demanding
sustainable papers solutions to replace plastics films for use in flexible packaging and improved packaging
functionality, which in turn is driving the need for barriers, resistance and heat-sealability on paper. The Coated
Specialties business also experiences demand driven by fluoro-free regulatory requirements and by digital media
replacing traditional media.

84


-----

_Insulation_

The Insulation business supplies electrotechnical insulation papers to manufacturers of transformers and
high voltage cables globally. The Insulation business also produces thin papers used as interleaves, masking for
textile printing, balancing foils under the Spantex[TM] brand and specialty long-fiber pulp. Demand for
electrotechnical insulation paper is driven by extensions and upgrades to power distribution networks and the
decentralization of power generation and power grids. Urbanization and construction activity also drive power
equipment investments in this business.

_Food Packaging_

The Food Packaging business offers a broad range of specialty papers and capabilities for quick service
restaurants, food processing, cooking and baking, and flexible packaging markets. Demand in the Food
Packaging business is increasingly driven by demand for sustainability, recyclability, and compostability,
alternatives to single use-plastics and improved packaging functionality. Demand is also driven by stricter food
safety and chemical regulations.

_Parchment_

The Parchment business produces a broad portfolio of solutions for food and industrial applications. The
Parchment product portfolio includes cooking and baking papers, baking-trays and molds and food packaging
papers for fresh and greasy foods. Parchment is also used in the textile tube and furniture laminate industries as
well as in radio frequency identification and printed circuit board and copper clad lamination. Demand in the
Parchment business is driven by a push from brand-owners towards using sustainable alternatives. Food and
industrial markets have increasingly been seeking cellulosic solutions with intrinsic barrier properties and other
functionalities to replace plastics. In 2020, in particular, demand was driven by the increase of cooking and
baking at home caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting lockdown measures.

_Technical_

The Technical business produces specialty products used for a wide variety of industrial and construction
applications. The product portfolio includes glass interleave papers, saturating bases, laminating bases, and other
industrial fiber-based solutions. Demand in the Technical business is driven by U.S. construction and
infrastructure activity, particularly homebuilding, and trends in residential and commercial building segments,
and changing building codes. The increased use of LCD/other displays and continuing need for higher quality
materials, desire for sustainable packaging, specifically in e-commerce and cold-chain applications, also drive
demand in this business.

_Decor_

The Decor business produces paper in a wide range of colors, grades and grammages for decorative
applications mainly used in laminated furniture, flooring and interior applications both for technical and
esthetical purposes. Demand in the Decor business is driven by the number of residential home starts,
commercial building projects and renovation. A rapidly growing middle class in developing markets is driving
construction and furniture demand. Demand in this business is also driven by interior design trends and trends of
substitution from solid wood to panel based furniture and, within panel-based furniture, substitution from veneer
and plastic foils to decor paper surfaces.

**_General economic conditions_**

The main end-user customer segments for our products and solutions include food and beverage processing
and packaging, transportation, homebuilding and furniture and the health care and life science industries. Growth
in our targeted markets is based on the general economic development with potential further upside from
increased value of new products or expanded product end-uses. Demand for our products is impacted by the
economic cycle. Lower end-use demand, stiffer competition and destocking in the value chain put pressure on
volumes and pricing, which in turn can have a negative impact on our financial results. To stay in tune with
changing market conditions, we monitor several factors in the operating environment. Each business has also
created its own strategy, taking specific trends relevant to its unique market into account. For example, some of
our businesses have been negatively impacted by the economic downturn that has followed the COVID-19
pandemic since the first quarter of 2020, but we also experienced strong demand in the healthcare and life
science end-use segments as solutions for personal protection equipment such as face masks, drapes and gowns,

85


-----

as well as diagnostics materials for rapid test kits and venting filters for devices used in the treatment of patients
with respiratory disorders were in strong demand. See “—Impact of COVID-19” below. Demand for products and
services distributed by us may also be affected, positively or negatively, by the economic conditions in the
regions and countries in which our end-customers operate. We believe that our global network of sales offices,
45 plants and converting sites in 14 countries and our more than 6,000 customers in over 100 countries helps us
manage the impact of events or situations specific to a given country.

**_Impact of COVID-19_**

On January 23, 2020, we initiated a centralized crisis alert team to carry out a global pandemic contingency
and preparedness response plan. We established a COVID-19 Safety Protocol to ensure safe operations and
customer service. Our manufacturing plants are maintaining a cohesive set of rules to keep operations running
and employees safe. Local adjustments are made according to country-level or local health and safety regulation
and guidance.

Our 45 plants and converting sites in 14 countries have remained operational during 2020, except for a few
temporary shutdowns caused by government lockdowns or employee absences related to quarantine or infections.
Production has not been interrupted to any significant extent due to raw material supply issues.

The impact of the pandemic on customer activity has varied. Since the first quarter of 2020, we have
experienced strong demand in the healthcare and life science end-use segments. Demand for solutions for
personal protection equipment such as face masks, drape and gown materials, as well as diagnostics materials for
rapid test kits and venting filters for devices used in the treatment of patients with respiratory disorders was
strong. This was primarily due to personal protection equipment shortages, which allowed us to shift sales of our
materials for such purposes even though they are more expensive than standard viral protection materials, and
despite the demand for the more typical uses for drape and gown materials having decreased in line with the
decreased number of surgeries. The exceptional circumstances, with regional lockdowns and limited mobility for
citizens, also increased demand for packaging-related release liner and packaging tape applications. In the second
quarter of 2020, demand for home building and furniture, transportation and industrial end-uses decreased due to
a large portion of the global population being in lockdown. In the third quarter of 2020, demand recovered in
home building and furniture, driven mainly by increased household furniture spending, as well as transportation
end uses. Towards the end of 2020, demand for industrial-related products improved. Overall demand for
consumer goods related applications, of which food and beverage and packaging represent the largest share,
remained relatively stable, but varied somewhat, depending on end use. The resurgence of the COVID-19
pandemic in the fourth quarter of 2020 caused many countries to reimpose restrictions, but these lighter and more
regional lockdowns did not have a material impact on demand in the fourth quarter of 2020.

The COVID-19 pandemic has created an exceptional situation globally and a strong demand for healthcare
goods in general, and particularly for protective medical products made from our fabrics. We have long been an
established manufacturer of nonwoven fabrics, which are used to construct protective medical fabrics such as
surgical gowns and drapes, pleated surgical face masks, protective apparel and sterile barrier systems. We have
produced the inner and outer coverstock used for pleated surgical face masks, and has recently begun to produce
the middle filter media. Thanks to our in-depth knowledge of filtration materials and common manufacturing
platform, we were able to respond swiftly to growing demand by expanding manufacturing of face mask fabrics
to lines normally used for producing other fiber-based materials. As of the second quarter of 2020, our offering
includes a full range of protective face mask fabrics for civil, surgical and respiratory masks. This allowed us to
fill production capacity that would have otherwise remained unused, in particular during the second and third
quarters of 2020. During the second half of 2020, our delivery volumes of face mask fabrics gradually decreased
as production and export of face masks from China resumed and global availability and price competition
increased.

**_Average Selling Price and Product Mix_**

The average selling prices we are able to obtain for our products and solutions affect our margin on variable
costs of our products and our results of operations. Our results are also affected by changes in the mix of
products sold from period to period due to different margin on variable costs associated with the different
products. Interchangeable materials and products that can replace our products, as well as new producers that
establish themselves within our product areas, can impact both price and volume. Our comparable EBITDA
margin varies based on the business. While some of our product groups in the Release Liners, Coated Specialties
and Decor businesses are more competitive and have a lower degree of differentiation, we target selected niche
markets that require technical specialization with high barriers to entry and value-based pricing. A common

86


-----

denominator is that they are fiber-based with a high degree of complexity and technical content. Products and
solutions that are more technical and complex, as well as customized, are typically characterized by higher
margins. In less differentiated product groups, cost efficiency is increasingly important. Margin on variable costs
has developed favorably in the periods under review as we successfully implemented our commercial strategy
that focuses on product differentiation, service and quality and optimized price and product mix. We also
continued to introduce several new value-adding products for our customers. Our sales from New Products
increased to 12% for the year ended December 31, 2020. We aim to continue to increase the percentage of our
net sales attributable to sales of New Products. In 2020, our net sales decreased due to an adverse currency effect,
lower selling prices and a less favorable product mix, although Comparable EBITDA margin increased to 12.5%,
due to lower costs.

**_Strategic acquisitions and divestments_**

We regularly evaluate opportunities for acquisition and expansion. Our aim is to grow our businesses
through both organic investments and acquisitions that add geographical scope, new technologies or customer
categories, which can lead to volume increase, customer retention or improved margins. In addition, we
undertake acquisitions to improve positions within existing markets, support expansion in growth markets or to
enter new markets. In October 2018, we completed the bolt-on acquisitions of Expera Specialty Solutions
Holdings, Inc., an U.S. based specialty paper producer (“Expera Specialty Solutions”), for a cash consideration of
€524.9 million, and MD Papéis’ Caieiras specialty paper mill in Brazil (“Caieiras”), for a cash consideration of
€96.7 million. In 2019, we achieved the targeted cost synergy run rate of €21 million from the acquisition of
Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras, exceeding the initial target of €14 million and actions implemented
during 2020, which were delayed due to the COVID-19 related lockdowns and travel restrictions, generated a
further €2 million of synergies.

The impact of the acquisitions of the Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras acquisitions on our net sales
and Comparable EBITDA are illustrated in the below chart:

(1) On January 1, 2020, we changed the presentation format for our income statement to present it based on function of expense, instead of
nature of expense and to align with its internal reporting. In connection with the adoption of the function of expense method, certain
minor reclassifications of income statement items have been made, resulting in a decrease in net sales of €1.0 million and an increase in
other operating income of €8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. For more information on changes in income statement
presentation, see “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Ahlstrom-Munksjo¨—Comparability of the Financial Statements—
_Presentation of Income Statement.”_

We expect to generate additional business synergies of at least €8 million from the Expera Specialty
Solutions acquisition, with a gradual impact from 2021 onwards. We believe there are additional cross-selling
opportunities related to the broader product offering and expanded presence, particularly in food processing and
packaging, such as specialty paper to wrap and package processed and quick service restaurant prepared foods.

Technology sharing is also expected to generate benefits in the manufacture of products, such as interleaving
papers and release liner. COVID-19-related lockdowns and travel restrictions have however delayed the
implementation of some of the planned actions.

In 2019, we completed the acquisition of filter converting capacity to grow the Liquid Technologies
business in Asia and North America. We are also exploring options to acquire or invest in Minglian, a Chinese
company comprising a greenfield decor paper plant in the city of Xingtai, Hebei Province, China following the
signing of a non-binding letter of intent in 2019. The transaction is subject to further due diligence, structuring
and agreeing final and binding transaction agreements. COVID-19 related lockdowns and travel restrictions have
delayed the negotiation and signing of the transaction, which could happen as early as during the first half of
2021.

Our regular assessment of the best structure of our platform of businesses resulted in the divestment of two
small businesses that had limited synergies with the rest of the Group during the periods under review. We
completed the sale of our fine art paper business ARCHES[®] in 2020 and the sale of our glass fiber reinforcement
business in Mikkeli, Finland in 2019. In addition, we are actively considering strategic alternatives in relation to
our entire Decor paper business, including any potential ownership in Minglian, where one of the options being
investigated the possibility of divestment of the Decor business.

Acquisitions and disposals can impact our sales and our profitability by changing the scope of our business
year on year. They can also lead to integration costs (and capital expenditure) in the year of acquisition or in
subsequent years depending on the time taken to integrate these companies in a country in which we already
operate. We have extensive experience from successful integration processes and realized synergies.

**_Raw materials and energy_**

We operate in a resource-intensive manufacturing industry and costs and availability of raw materials
impact our performance. Our primary raw materials are commodity pulp, wood to produce pulp, other renewable
fibers, various synthetic fibers including glass and plastic as well as chemicals including titanium dioxide and
energy. Volatility, price increase and the availability of raw materials, particularly commodity pulp and wood,
impact our margin on variable costs of our products and affect our financial results. We use different types of
pulp, such as long, short fiber and specialty pulps, in our production. We work with a reasonably large number of
suppliers to secure the diverse inputs needed. Our commodity pulp consumption was approximately
1,200 thousand tons for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our pulp exposure was reduced by approximately
500 thousand tons of our own pulp production during the year ended December 31, 2020, which includes
185 thousand tons of market pulp production at our Aspa pulp mill in Sweden that is sold to third parties. There
is a structured process for the procurement of pulp, which is managed globally. This structured procurement
process creates conditions for better service and lower costs, and it also requires less administration and allows
improved consistency of practices to better ensure compliance.

Energy costs also represent a significant portion of the production costs. We mainly consume electricity,
gas, coal and oil. Changes in prices or availability of energy may increase or decrease our operating costs, as
applicable, and impact our operating results and margins.

In order to drive EBITDA growth and to support our margins, we implemented a savings program focused
on variable cost reduction through procurement savings and other improvement actions. The savings program
was completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the initial target of €50 million. Raw material and energy prices
negatively impacted results in 2019. In 2020, our profitability benefitted from lower raw material prices and was
supported by our cost-saving measures.

**_Innovation_**

As a niche player, innovation, identifying trends and developing new customer solutions is increasingly
important in ensuring our future competitiveness. We have extensive research and development capabilities in
each business area. R&D in the business areas is carried out in the production processes at the various plants and
in collaboration with customers. We also operate two R&D facilities in France, one in Pont-Evêque and one in
Apprieu. The innovation and product development resources have been significantly strengthened through the
merger of Ahlstrom and Munksjö as well as through the recent acquisitions of Expera Specialty Solutions and
Caieiras. In addition, marketing, sales and customer service organizations all form integral parts of the R&D
process by supporting the understanding of what areas of development to give priority to, what improvements in
qualities are needed, and what new applications are sought after by customers. We have a strong product
development platform and we aim to increase the amount of sales generated from New Products in the coming

88


-----

years. In 2020, approximately 12% of our net sales were attributable to New Products. We plan to continue to
launch new products that add value for our customers. Examples of new sustainable products included Extia[®]
launched in 2019, a filtration material designed to extend the lifetime of air pollution applications, CelluStraw, a
plastic-free renewable material for drinking straws also launched in 2019, and a FortiCell[®] LAB, a range of high
performance fiber-based solutions for energy storage applications launched in 2020 and TenderGuard[™]
BioBased launch in 2021 as an alternative to fossil based media for face masks applications.

We are committed to sustainability and we have integrated sustainable practices throughout our value chain.
It is also an important driver in most of our markets. Our areas of research include improved sustainability, which
involves making existing products more environmentally friendly by, for example, making them compostable,
recyclable or using lower amounts or different chemicals. One of our strategic directions is to develop barrier
papers based on biopolymers to offer biodegradable packaging media. Other areas of research include various
forms of nanocellulose, which is renewable and biodegradable, has a wide range of applications and we expect it
will compete with plastics and other nondegradable materials in many areas. Our goal is to create new materials
for electrotechnical insulation to manufacturers of transformers and high voltage cables. We also focus on
researching biopolymers, which are bi-products of the pulp used in production. Biopolymers are used for
enhancing current paper products. In 2020, our expenditure on R&D, comprising of R&D expenses and
capitalized R&D costs, was €27.2 million, representing 1% of our net sales, excluding technical product
development costs carried out in close cooperation with customers.

**_Capital expenditures_**

Our Capital expenditures are key to maintaining our competitiveness and enhanced production capability,
and also represent an important driver of our results of operations. Our Capital expenditures for the years ended
December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 were €160.1 million, €161.1 million and €117.5 million, respectively,
partially driven by our €200 million strategic investment program that we have been progressing since 2017 and
which includes investments in 13 projects (11 have been completed while the remaining are scheduled to be
completed during 2021 and 2022). These investments aim to increase and improve our production capabilities
and to allow us to grow while retaining attractive cash flows. A significant proportion of our Capital expenditures
in 2018 and 2019 were related to projects undertaken in the Filtration business in Madisonville, United States,
the Abrasive business in Arches, France, the Parchment business in San Severin, France, and the Coated
Specialties business in Jacareí, Brazil, and a boiler and pulp line rebuild in our plant in Billingsfors, Sweden, part
of the Insulation business. Given these significant investments in increasing capacity and improving
manufacturing capabilities, we believe our production facilities are relatively well-invested and that we are wellpositioned to support future growth. We estimate our Maintenance capital expenditure as approximately 3% of
our net sales, and we estimate that approximately €90 million of annual capital expenditures (including IT
spending) are required to maintain the competitiveness of our current portfolio which supports our product
capability.

**_Currency Exchange Rates_**

_Transactional_

Due to our global operations, we generate a portion of our revenue, and incur a portion of our expenses, in
currencies other than the euro, which are primarily U.S. dollar, Swedish krona, Chinese renminbi, Brazilian real,
British pound sterling and South Korean won. As a result of Ahlstrom Munksjö’s increased presence in the
United States, we are particularly exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar. A large share of
operating expenses is in euro and U.S. dollars. In addition, purchase prices of pulp, chemicals and freight are
primarily based on U.S. dollar. However, the significant operations in the United States and the denomination of
key raw materials and freight in U.S. dollars create a natural hedge. During the periods under review, we hedged
approximately 75% of forecasted cash flows for a period up to nine months if the total exposure to forecasted net
flows of foreign currency exceeds the equivalent of 2% of the total turnover of the company. As of December 31,
2020, the fair value of the forwards under hedge accounting was €4.2 million. See note 19 to the 2020 Financial
Statements for further information on currency risk and the use of derivative instruments and hedging activities.

We may also be exposed to currency transaction risks through firm commitments to buy businesses. For
instance, in 2018, we hedged a portion ($300 million nominal) of the U.S. dollar-denominated firm commitment
to acquire Expera Specialty Solutions in latter part of 2018 by using a foreign exchange forward contract. The
gain on hedge amounted to €4.4 million which was recorded as an adjustment to the purchase consideration.

89


-----

In addition, following the Transactions, a large portion of our indebtedness will be denominated in
U.S. dollars. Strengthening of the euro against the U.S. dollar will result in a decrease in the euro value of our
U.S. dollar-denominated indebtedness and vice versa. As adjusted to give effect to the Transactions and the
Offering, a significant portion of our indebtedness will be denominated in U.S. dollars.

_Translational_

We report our consolidated financial statements in our functional currency, which is the euro. As a result,
the assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses of all of our operations with a currency other than the euro are
translated into euro at then applicable exchange rates. Consequently, increases or decreases in the value of the
euro affect the value of these items with respect to the non-euro-denominated businesses in the consolidated
financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. For example, a stronger euro
will reduce the reported results of operations of non-euro businesses and conversely a weaker euro will increase
the reported results of operations of non-euro businesses. While we aim to minimize currency risk related to
translation exposure by aiming to balance assets and liabilities of subsidiaries so that the foreign exchange risk is
minimized in the consolidated balance sheet, these translations could affect the comparability of our results
between financial periods or result in changes to the carrying value of our assets, liabilities and shareholders’
equity. Exchange differences on translation of foreign operations during 2020 amounted to €78.3 million and is
recognized in the other comprehensive income line item.

**Factors Affecting the Comparability of the Financial Statements**

**_Presentation of the Income Statement_**

On January 1, 2020, we changed the presentation of its income statement to the function of expense method
from the nature of expense to align with its internal reporting. The comparative income statement information for
the year ended December 31, 2019 in the 2020 Financial Statements has been restated according to the function
of expense method to facilitate comparability and is unaudited. The income statement was presented using the
nature of expense method in the 2019 Financial Statements and in the 2018 Financial Statements. In connection
with the adoption of the function of expense method, certain minor reclassifications and changes in names of
income statement items have been made in the 2020 Financial Statements. As a result of these reclassifications,
net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased by €1.0 million from the previous year and other
operating income for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by €8.6 million from the previous year. These
reclassifications had no impact on Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s operating result or net result for the year ended
December 31, 2019. In the 2020 Financial Statements, certain income statement line items were also renamed,
such as net profit to net result and profit before tax to result before tax. As a result, the 2019 Financial Statements
and the 2018 Financial Statements are not directly comparable with the 2020 Financial Statements or the 2019
comparative, unaudited, restated column presented therein. In order to provide meaningful comparable financial
information in this Offering Memorandum, income statement information for the year ended December 31, 2019
is presented on an audited historical basis when comparing to the financial information for the year ended
December 31, 2018, and, otherwise, is extracted without adjustment from the unaudited, restated comparative
column included in the 2020 Financial Statements. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—
_Ahlstrom-Munksjo¨—Comparability of the Financial Statements—Presentation of Income Statement.”_

**_Changes to Reportable Segments_**

In 2019, we decided to implement a new business structure, which became effective on January 1, 2020, to
promote core business capabilities and sharpen strategic targets and align the business characteristics of each
business area. For periods after January 1, 2020, our five business areas comprise Filtration & Performance
Solutions, Advance Solutions, Industrial Solutions, Food Packaging & Technical Solutions, and Decor Solutions,
which also form our operating and reporting segments. For periods prior to January 1, 2020, our five business
areas comprised Filtration & Performance Solutions, Industrial Solutions, Decor, Specialties, and North
American Specialty Solutions.

In the new structure, North America Specialty Solutions is integrated into the operating platform and
businesses are partly reorganized to reflect our expansion in North America following the initial integration
phase of the North America Specialty Solutions business. The new business structure is comprised of sixteen
businesses that underlie each business area as compared to fourteen businesses under the previous structure. In
the 2020 Financial Statements, we have restated our presentation of the financial information of our business

90


-----

areas for the comparative year ended December 31, 2019 to reflect its new business structure and the restated
financial information is unaudited. However, no business area financial information for any prior period has been
restated and the business area financial information for the year ended December 31, 2018 is presented based on
our previous business areas and is not comparable to the business area information presented in the 2020
Financial Statements. In order to provide meaningful comparable information in this Offering Memorandum, we
present the financial information for the business areas for the year ended December 31, 2019 based on the prior
business areas when comparing to the financial information for the year ended December 31, 2018, and,
otherwise, based on the new business areas. See note 4 to the 2020 Financial Statements for further information
on our new business area information.

_Segment Reporting Principles_

Our CEO, assisted by the Executive Management Team, is our chief operating decision maker. Operating
segments are determined on the basis of information reviewed by the CEO for the purposes of allocating
resources and assessing our business area’s performance. The business area’s performance is assessed internally
on the basis of net sales and Comparable EBITDA. Comparable EBITDA is defined for internal management
reporting purposes as operating result before depreciation, amortization and impairments and excluding items
affecting comparability.

For the year ended December 31, 2018 and following the acquisitions of Expera Specialty Solutions and
Caieiras, each business area’s performance was assessed internally on the basis of its net sales and Comparable
EBITDA, in each case pro forma for the acquisitions of Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras. Net sales, pro
forma for the acquisitions of Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras, is defined for internal management
reporting purposes as net sales giving pro forma effect to the net sales impact of the acquisitions of Expera
Specialty Solutions and Caieiras. Comparable EBITDA pro forma for the acquisitions of Expera Specialty
Solutions and Caieiras is defined for internal reporting purposes as EBITDA excluding certain items affecting
comparability and giving pro forma effect to the acquisitions of Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras. The pro
forma impact of the acquisitions of Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras on net sales and Comparable
EBITDA for internal management reporting purposes is presented as if Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras
had been consolidated to full-year results for the year ended December 31, 2018.

**_Acquisitions and Divestments_**

We acquired Expera Specialty Solutions, a U.S. based specialty paper producer, on October 10, 2018, and
Caieiras, a specialty paper mill in Brazil, on October 17, 2018. Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras were
consolidated into our historical consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. The
income statement or statement of cash flows for any period prior to such dates do not include the impact of such
acquisitions. As a result, given the magnitude of the acquisitions of Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras, the
historical consolidated income statement and cash flow information for 2018 are not comparable to such
information for any subsequent period. Business area net sales and Comparable EBITDA for the year ended
December 31, 2018 is presented herein in accordance with IFRS 8 (Operating Segments) based on internal
management reporting information giving effect to the impact of the acquisitions of Expera Specialty Solutions
and Caieiras and is thus on a comparable basis to such information for the year ended December 31, 2019. See
also “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Ahlstrom-Munksjo¨—Comparability of the Financial
_Statements—Acquisitions and Disposals—Acquisitions of Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras.”_

In addition, we made an acquisition to grow our highly profitable Liquid Technologies business in 2019 and
completed two divestments in 2020. As a result, our consolidated financial information may not be comparable
following the date of such acquisition or divestments.

**_Other Changes to Accounting Policies_**

_Adoption of IFRS 16_

We adopted IFRS 16 (Leases) on January 1, 2019. The new standard resulted in the recognition of the
majority of our leases on the balance sheet and therefore our assets and liabilities have increased. The adoption of
IFRS 16 increased right-of-use assets by €57.0 million, non-current liabilities by €44.1 million and current
liabilities by €12.3 million in the opening balance sheet as of January 1, 2019. The impact on EBITDA for the
year ended December 31, 2019 was €16.3 million, as the formal rental charges are reflected in depreciation and
interest expense under IFRS 16. We have adopted the new standard using a simplified approach and thus
comparative figures are not restated. See notes 1, 8, 9 and 12 to the 2019 Financial Statements for more
information.

91


-----

_Adoption of IFRIC 23_

As of January 1, 2019, we adopted IFRIC 23 (Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments). As a result of the
adoption of IFRIC 23, we recognized an adjustment in an amount of €2.6 million to increase our income tax
liabilities and to decrease retained earnings at January 1, 2019. Our financial statements as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2018 do not apply IFRIC 23. As a result, the results of operations for the year ended
December 31, 2018 may not be directly comparable with the results of operations for the years ended
December 31, 2019 and 2020.

_Reclassification of certain balance sheet items_

In 2019, Ahlstrom-Munksjö changed the classification of certain balance sheet items between interestbearing and non-interest-bearing liabilities. The comparative information as of December 31, 2018 has been
restated accordingly. The restatement as of December 31, 2018 from current borrowings to trade and other
payables amounted to €8.8 million. In 2019, lease liabilities were also reclassified from borrowings to a separate
line item, and lease liabilities as of December 31, 2018 were restated accordingly. The lease liabilities as of
December 31, 2018 relate to finance leases in accordance with previously used IAS 17 (Leases) and the related
interpretations, which were replaced by IFRS 16 as of January 1, 2019. The restated information is unaudited.

**_Impact of the Transactions_**

On October 22, 2020, the Issuer launched the Tender Offer to acquire up to all of the Company Shares for
cash consideration equal to the Tender Offer Price. On February 4, 2021, the first settlement under the Tender
Offer occurred and the Issuer acquired approximately 81.0% of the Company Shares. On February 10, 2021, the
second settlement under the Tender Offer occurred and the Issuer acquired approximately 9.6% of the Company
Shares. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, 2021, the Issuer owned approximately 90.6% of the
Company Shares. See “Summary—The Transactions—The Acquisition—The Tender Offer.” Consequently, our
consolidated financial information following the Transactions will not be fully comparable with our historical
consolidated financial information due to, among other things, (i) the application of purchase accounting from
the date of acquisition in connection with the Acquisition, (ii) changes to depreciation and amortization expenses,
among other things, that may result from the purchase accounting of the Acquisition, (iii) additional interest
expense associated with the financing of the Transactions (including the refinancing of certain of AhlstromMunksjö’s existing debt), and (iv) changes to the level of consolidation of our results in the future, following a
de-listing (if any). See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Ahlstrom-Munksjo¨—Comparability of
_the Financial Statements—Impact of the Transactions.”_

**Components of Our Historical Results of Operations**

(1) On January 1, 2020, we changed the presentation format for our income statement to present it based on function of expense, instead of
nature of expense and to align with its internal reporting. In connection with the adoption of the function of expense method, certain
minor reclassifications of income statement items have been made, resulting in a decrease in net sales of €1.0 million and an increase in
other operating income of €8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. For more information on changes in income statement
presentation, see “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Ahlstrom-Munksjo¨—Comparability of the Financial Statements—
_Presentation of Income Statement.”_

(2) We adopted IFRS 16 (Leases) as of January 1, 2019, using the simplified approach. Figures for the periods prior to January 1, 2019 have
not restated and, therefore, are not fully comparable. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Ahlstrom-Munksjo¨—
_Comparability of the Financial Statements—Changes to Accounting Standards—IFRS 16.”_

(3) In October 2018, we acquired Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras. Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras were consolidated into
our historical consolidated financial statements as of their respective acquisition dates. As a result, financial and other information for the
year ended December 31, 2018 is not directly comparable with financial and other information for subsequent periods. See “Presentation
_of Financial and Other Information—Ahlstrom-Munksjo¨—Comparability of the Financial Statements—Acquisitions and Disposals—_

The following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020
and 2019. On January 1, 2020, we changed the presentation format of our income statement to the function of
expense method from the nature of expense method, to align with our internal reporting. The comparative income
statement information for the year ended December 31, 2019 in the 2020 Financial Statements has been restated
according to the function of expense method to facilitate comparability and is unaudited. The income statement

method. In connection with the adoption of the function of expense method, certain minor reclassifications and
changes in names of income statement items have been made. Certain income statement items previously
reported within net sales, such as operative exchange gains and losses and operative foreign exchange derivative
results, were classified to other income statement lines. In addition, certain accounting policy alignments were
made between net sales and other operating income relating to previous acquisitions, and the income from the
sale of emission and other environmental rights previously classified in other operating expenses was reclassified
to other operating income. Due to these reclassifications, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019
decreased by €1.0 million and other operating income for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by
€8.6 million. The reclassifications had no impact on our operating result or net result for the year ended
December 31, 2019. Accordingly, income statement information for the year ended December 31, 2019 as
compared to such information for the year ended December 31, 2020 is extracted without adjustment from the
unaudited, restated comparative column included in the 2020 Financial Statements. See “—Factors Affecting the
_Comparability of the Financial Statements—Presentation of the Income Statement.”_

_Net sales_

Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by €232.0 million, or 8.0%, to €2,683.3 million,
from €2,915.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to adverse
currency effects, lower selling prices and a less favorable product mix, including due to COVID-19, as well as
divestments of the glass fiber reinforcement and fine arts businesses. In terms of product mix, deliveries
increased significantly in healthcare and life science-related end-uses, and grew modestly in consumer goods
related end-uses. Deliveries decreased in transportation and industrial related applications and fell slightly in
home-building and furniture-related end-uses.

_Net sale by business area_

From January 1, 2020, we implemented a new business structure under which we reorganized our business
areas. See “—Factors Affecting the Comparability of the Financial Statements—Changes to Reportable
_Segments” above. The following table sets forth net sales by business area, based on the new business structure,_
for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.

- Filtration & Performance Solutions

Net sales in the Filtration & Performance Solutions business area decreased by €87.0 million, or 12.0%, to
€637.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €724.0 million for the year ended December 31,
2019. This decrease was primarily due to lower sales volumes, particularly in the Filtration business and the
divestments of the glass fiber reinforcement and fine arts businesses, which had an impact of approximately
€43.0 million on net sales. Filtration & Performance Solutions saw a large cyclical decline in the year ended
December 31, 2020 due to COVID-19 induced end-market weaknesses. Demand for filtration materials gradually
recovered in the second half of 2020 following a decline in the second quarter. In particular, face mask material
deliveries compensated for temporarily lower demand in the second and third quarters of 2020 as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic. Demand for glass fiber flooring, abrasive backings, wallcovers and plasterboard materials
also improved in 2020 compared with 2019. Demand in Filtration & Performance Solutions in 2020 was also
supported in part by new product launches, including FibRoc[®], a new product platform of high performance
solutions for durable applications and the launch of product portfolio for lead acid batteries under the FortiCell
range of fiber-based solutions for energy storage applications.

- Advanced Solutions

Net sales in the Advanced Solutions business area increased by €5.9 million, or 1.3%, to €476.2 million for
the year ended December 31, 2020, from €470.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase
was primarily due to higher selling prices and volumes, largely offset by an adverse currency effect. Deliveries
increased in all businesses except Precision Coating, where they decreased significantly primarily due to the
impact on the aerospace industry. Advanced Solutions experienced a strong demand for medical and life science
products and demand growth for tap backings, tea and coffee materials and fibrous meat casing materials,
partially offset by weakened demand for specialty release liners due to low aerospace activity. Demand for
Advanced Solutions products was supported by the launch of Trustshield Biological, a personal protective
apparel medical fabric designed to shield against hazardous pathogens and our partnership with BUFF, a
producer of sport and lifestyle accessories, for the supply of replaceable filter media in face masks.

- Industrial Solutions

Net sales in the Industrial Solutions business area decreased by €81.8 million, or 10.7%, to €683.9 million
for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €765.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease
was primarily due to lower selling prices and an adverse currency effect. The lower selling prices were, in part,
driven by pulp price decline during this period. We experienced a growth in demand for release liners for labels
and improving demand for industrial grades following a weaker second quarter in 2020. There was also a
recovery in demand for electrotechnical and steel interleaving papers in the fourth quarter of 2020 and an
improvement in demand for coated papers, particularly in Brazil, after a decline in the second quarter. We also
completed the investment in a new power co-generation plant at the Turin site in Italy.

- Food Packaging & Technical Solutions

Net sales in the Food Packaging & Technical Solutions business area decreased by €27.8 million, or 4.8%,
to €554.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €582.4 million for the year ended December 31,
2019. This decrease was primarily due to lower delivery volumes, particularly in the Technical business and an
adverse currency effect. Average selling prices were also lower and were partly impacted by a less favorable
product mix. Demand for food processing and packaging continued to improve in 2020, following a mild
rebound in restaurant traffic later in the year. There was robust demand for parchment cooking and baking papers
in North America and flexible packaging products sold in grocery stores. Demand for specialty papers in
industrial and construction applications rebounded in the fourth quarter of 2020.

- Decor Solutions

Net sales in the Decor Solutions business area decreased by €49.9 million, or 11.9%, to €369.7 million for
the year ended December 31, 2020, from €419.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease
was primarily due to significantly low delivery volumes in the second quarter of 2020, lower selling prices and
an adverse currency effect. The lower selling prices were driven by declining raw material prices (titanium
dioxide and pulp). After a market recovery from 2019 in the first quarter of 2020, demand for decor paper
dropped at the end of March, following the closures of retail furniture outlets as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic. In the second half of 2020, there was a strong market recovery, following their re-opening. Similarly,
there was broad-based downtime for decor paper customers and end-customers from mid-March to mid-June but
strong recovery in demand in the second half of 2020. While demand in office and shop furniture was weak,
there was strong demand in the home furniture and home renovation segments during the summer and fall
driving orders in the second half of the year.

_Cost of goods sold_

Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by €274.7 million, or 10.8%, to
€2,269.5 million, from €2,544.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due
to lower raw material, production costs, energy costs, delivery expenses and other variable costs due to our
€50 million cost savings program that was initiated in 2020 and focused on variable cost reduction through
procurement savings and other improvement actions was completed ahead of schedule and exceeded targets.

_Sales and marketing expenses_

Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by €11.5 million, or 16.8%,
to €56.7 million, from €68.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to
COVID-19 related fixed-cost savings in the year ended December 31, 2020 and inclusion of integration costs
related to Expera and restructuring costs, in the year ended December 31, 2019.

_R&D expenses_

R&D expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by €5.8 million, or 37.8%, to €21.0 million,
from €15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to increased R&D
depreciation and decrease in R&D project capitalization.

_Administrative expenses_

Administrative expenses increased by €2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or 1.3%, to
€151.6 million, from €149.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to
cost inflation and costs related to the sale of the fine arts paper business and the Tender Offer, partially offset by
COVID-19 related fixed-cost savings.

_Other operating income_

Other operating income increased by €33.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or 159.9%, to
€53.8 million, from €20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to a
gain from the sale of the fine arts business in Arches, France and an increase in government grants comprising
mostly of energy subsidies and other government incentives, partially offset by a reduction in gains on sale of
emission rights and other environmental rights in the year ended December 31, 2020.

_Other operating expense_

Other operating expense increased by €6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or 11.6%, to
€62.4 million, from €55.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to
higher impairment loss related to machinery and equipment in Stenay, France, an old gas turbine in Turin, Italy
and a right-of-use asset office building in Sweden.

_Share of profit in equity accounted investments_

Share of profit in equity accounted investments remained stable at €0.2 million.

_Net financial items_

Net financial items decreased by €5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or 11.3%, to an
expense of €45.7 million, from an expense of €51.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease
was primarily due to a decrease in net interest expenses by €11.1 million due to lower interest rates and a
currency exchange loss of €2.2 million.

_Net result_

Net result increased by €61.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or 187.7%, to €94.5 million,
from €32.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of the factors discussed above.

method. We prepared our 2020 Financial Statements, including the 2019 comparative column therein, in line
with the new presentation. We have not restated the financial information for any prior period. Accordingly,
income statement information for the year ended December 31, 2019 is presented below on an audited historical
basis when comparing to the financial information for the year ended December 31, 2018. See “—Factors
_Affecting the Comparability of the Financial Statements—Presentation of the Income Statement.”_

In addition, we acquired Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras on October 10, 2018 and October 17,
2018, respectively, and consolidated such entities into our historical consolidated financial statements from their
respective dates of acquisition. The consolidated income statement or statement of cash flows for the year ended
December 31, 2018 do not reflect the impact of such acquisitions, and as a result, is not directly comparable with
such information for the year ended December 31, 2019 (or any subsequent period). Business area net sales
information for the year ended December 31, 2018 presented herein are presented in accordance with IFRS 8 and
are based on internal management reporting giving effect to the impact of the acquisitions of Expera Specialty
Solutions and Caieiras as if these had been consolidated in the results for the full year ended December 31, 2018.

_Net sales_

Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by €478.3 million, or 19.6%, to €2,916.3 million,
from €2,438.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was mainly due to the acquisitions of
Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras in October 2018. Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019
decreased by €80.6 million, or 2.7%, to €2,916.3 million, from €2,996.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2018 as presented based on internal management reporting giving effect to the impact of the acquisitions of
Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras as if these had been consolidated in the results for the full year ended
December 31, 2018. Delivery volumes fell in all business areas and were partially offset by higher selling prices
in all business areas except Industrial Solutions.

reporting which gives effect to the impact of the acquisitions of Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras. See “Presentation of Financial

(2) Represent impact of the acquisitions of Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras as if these had been consolidated in the results for the
full year ended December 31, 2018 (impact prior to acquisition), of which €40.3 million relates to Decor, €28.1 million to Industrial
Solutions and €490.6 million to North America Specialty Solutions.

 - Decor

After a long period of destocking and lower end-use demand, demand for decor paper recovered in the
fourth quarter of 2019. Due to weak demand and eroding raw material prices, price pressure and competition
were significant in 2019. Net sales in the Decor business area increased by €14.2 million, or 3.5%, to
€422.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from net sales of €407.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018. The increase was mainly due to the acquisition of Caieiras in October 2018. Net sales in the
Decor business area decreased by €29.8 million, or 6.6%, to €422.1 million for the year ended December 31,
2019, from net sales of €451.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as presented based on internal
management reporting giving effect to the impact of the acquisition of Caieiras as if it had been consolidated in
the results for the full year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was mainly due to lower sales volumes.
While prices fell during 2019, reflecting a decrease in key raw material costs, the average selling price for the
year was stable. The positive impact of lower variable costs was offset by increased fixed cost per ton.

- Filtration & Performance Solutions

Demand for filtration products, and transportation especially, remained at a low level in Europe and the
Americas, while improved in Asia. In construction-related markets, demand for plasterboard, flooring and other
glass fiber tissue end-uses remained solid, while the wallcoverings market in Europe weakened. Net sales in the
Filtration & Performance Solutions business area increased by €3.5 million, or 0.5%, to €665.6 million for the
year ended December 31, 2019, from €662.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was
mainly due to the acquisitions of Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras in October 2018. Net sales in the
Filtration & Performance Solutions business area decreased by €7.0 million, or 1.0%, to €665.6 million for the
year ended December 31, 2019, from €672.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as presented based
on internal management reporting giving effect to the impact of the acquisitions of Expera Specialty Solutions
and Caieiras as if these had been consolidated in the results for the full year ended December 31, 2018. Lower
sales volumes were partially offset by higher selling prices, an improved product mix and a favorable currency
effect.

-----

- Industrial Solutions

Demand for release liners improved for some grades in the second half of 2019, while the market
environment remained competitive. Demand for electrotechnical insulation and interleaving papers remained
stable, while demand for specialty pulp improved during the fourth quarter. The markets for abrasive backings
and coated products were weak with improving signs for coated products in Brazil towards the end of the year.
Net sales in the Industrial Solutions business area decreased by €9.1 million, or 1.4%, to €653.5 million for the
year ended December 31, 2019, from net sales of €662.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Net
sales in the Industrial Solutions business area decreased by €37.8 million, or 5.5%, to €653.5 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019, from net sales of €691.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as presented
based on internal management reporting giving effect to the impact of the acquisitions of Expera Specialty
Solutions and Caieiras as if these had been consolidated in the results for the full year ended December 31, 2018.
This decrease was mainly due to lower volumes in the paper businesses and lower selling prices for specialty
pulp.

- North America Specialty Solutions

Demand for food processing and packaging papers was stable in 2019, while the markets for industrial and
technical specialty papers remained soft. In the release liner segment, demand in commodity grades remained
weak and was impacted by new capacity and intensified competition, while demand for coated products
remained relatively solid. Net sales in the North American Specialty Solutions business area increased by
€506.1 million, or 373.7%, to €641.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from net sales of
€135.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was mainly due to the acquisitions of Expera
Specialty Solutions and Caieiras in October 2018. Net sales in the North American Specialty Solutions business
area increased by €15.5 million, or 2.5%, to €641.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from net sales
of €626.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as presented based on internal management reporting
giving effect to the impact of the acquisitions of Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras as if these had been
consolidated in the results for the full year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was driven by higher selling
prices and a favorable currency effect. Deliveries were lower in 2019.

- Specialties

In the Food Packaging business, demand for parchment papers for food processing and packaging remained
weak in 2019. Beverage markets improved and demand for fibrous meat casing materials remained strong.
Demand for tape backings in Europe and North America was weaker in 2019, while it continued to be strong in
Asia. In the Advanced Liquid Technologies and Medical businesses, demand remained mostly robust. Net sales
in the Specialties business area decreased by €3.8 million, or 0.7%, to €561.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019, from €564.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Net sales in the Specialties
business area decreased by €19.3 million, or 3.3%, to €561.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from
€580.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as presented based on internal management reporting
giving effect to the impact of the acquisitions of Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras as if these had been
consolidated in the results for the full year ended December 31, 2018, as higher selling prices were more than
offset by lower deliveries.

_Materials and supplies_

€1,317.8 million, from €1,208.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was mainly due to
the acquisition of Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras, which was partially offset by decreased raw materials
prices in the Decor business area and a lower cost of pulp in the second half of 2019, and lower volumes in all
business areas, which in turn was partially offset by the impact of raw materials pricing in other business areas.
Materials and supplies for the year ended December 31, 2019 amounted to 45.2% of net sales for the year ended
December 31, 2019.

_Other operating expenses_

Other operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by €128.6 million, or 21.8%, to
€718.1 million, from €589.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to
the acquisition of Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras as well as higher energy costs and was partially offset
by changes to leasing and rental costs due to the implementation of IFRS 16. Other operating expenses for the
year ended December 31, 2019 amounted to 24.6% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019.

_Employee benefit expenses_

Employee benefit expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by €130.7 million, or 28.9%, to
€583.1 million, from €452.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to

-----

the acquisition of Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras as well as an increase in wages and salaries, statutory
social expenses and pension expenses due to an increase in the number of full-time equivalent employees over
the period, which partially offset by decreases in other long-term incentives and indirect employee costs.
Employee benefit expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 amounted to 20.0% of net sales for the year
ended December 31, 2019.

_Depreciation, amortization and impairment_

Depreciation, amortization and impairment for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by
€42.3 million, or 31.6%, to €176.2 million, from €133.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This
increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras. Depreciation,
amortization and impairment includes depreciation and amortization arising from purchase price allocation of
€52.1 million in 2019 as compared to €34.7 million in 2018.

_Net financial items_

Net financial items for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by €26.2 million, or 103.5%, to
€51.6 million, from €25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to
higher net debt during 2019 as a result of the acquisition of Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras. Net
financial items includes net interest expenses of €47.6 million, a currency exchange gain of €2.8 million and
other financial expenses of €6.7 million, in each case, for the year ended December 31, 2019.

_Net result_

Net result for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased by €10.1 million, or 23.5%, to €32.8 million,
from €42.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of the factors discussed above.

**_EBITDA and Comparable EBITDA_**

The following table sets forth EBITDA and Comparable EBITDA for the periods indicated, with a
reconciliation to net result. We acquired Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras on October 10, 2018 and
October 17, 2018, respectively, and consolidated such entities into its historical consolidated financial statements
from their respective dates of acquisition. The consolidated income statement or statement of cash flows for the
year ended December 31, 2018, however, do not reflect the impact of such acquisitions, and as a result, is not
directly comparable with such information for the year ended December 31, 2019 (or any subsequent period).
Business area Comparable EBITDA information for the year ended December 31, 2018 presented herein is in
accordance with IFRS 8 and based on internal management reporting giving effect to the impact of the
acquisitions of Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras as if these had been consolidated to full year 2018 result.

(1) The implementation of the IFRS 16 standard on January 1, 2019 had a positive impact of €16.3 million on EBITDA for the year ended
December 31, 2019, as the formal rental charges are reflected in depreciation and interest expense under IFRS 16, and the comparative
figures for the year ended December 31, 2018 were not restated. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Ahlstrom_Munksjo¨—Comparability of the Financial Statements—Changes to Accounting Standards—IFRS 16.”_

Comparable EBITDA increased by €21.4 million, or 6.8%, to €334.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020, from €312.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Comparable EBITDA margin
was 12.5% in 2020, as compared to 10.7% in 2019, mainly due to lower variable costs as a result of the cost
saving program, which more than offset the negative impact of lower selling prices. MOVC for products (per
metric ton) increased also increased as a result.

EBITDA increased by €75.1 million, or 26.9%, to €354.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020,
from €279.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Items affecting comparability totaled a net expense
of €20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to a net expense of €33.4 million for the
year ended December 31, 2019, and were mainly related to capital gains from the sale of the fine arts paper
business in Arches, France in 2020 and costs related to the Tender Offer.

Comparable EBITDA increased by €35.2 million, or 12.7%, to €312.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019, from €277.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 but when giving effect to the
acquisition of Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras, it decreased year-on-year. Gross margin for products (per
metric ton) improved as increased selling prices more than offset higher variable costs. Fixed costs increased
slightly. The implementation of the IFRS 16 standard had a positive impact of €16.3 million on EBITDA in 2019
as the formal rental charges are reflected in depreciation and interest expense under IFRS 16.

EBITDA increased by €56.8 million, or 25.5%, to €279.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019,
from €222.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, but when giving effect to the acquisition of Expera
Specialty Solutions and Caieiras, it decreased year-on-year. Items affecting comparability included in EBITDA
totaled €33.4 million as a net expense for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to a net expense of
€55.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and were mainly related to the integration of Expera
Specialty Solutions and restructuring costs.

_Comparable EBITDA by business area for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019_

From January 1, 2020, we implemented a new business structure under which we reorganized our business

_Filtration & Performance Solutions_

Comparable EBITDA in the Filtration & Performance Solutions business area decreased by €7.5 million, or
6.0%, to €118.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €126.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019, representing 18.6% of net sales in 2020 as compared to 17.4% in 2019, due to lower sales
volumes, partially offset by improved cost efficiency.

_Advanced Solutions_

Comparable EBITDA in the Advanced Solutions business area increased by €10.4 million, or 20.6%, to
€61.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €50.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019,
representing 12.8% of net sales in 2020 as compared to 10.8% in 2019, mainly due to a larger share of sales of
medical and life science products, which more than offset the impact of lower specialty release liner deliveries.

_Industrial Solutions_

Comparable EBITDA in the Industrial Solutions business segment increased by €10.2 million, or 16.6%, to
€71.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €61.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019,
representing 10.4% of net sales in 2020 as compared to 8.0% in 2019, mainly due to lower costs that were
reduced partly as a result of our cost savings program, which more than offset lower selling prices.

_Food Packaging & Technical Solutions_

Comparable EBITDA in the Food Packaging & Technical Solutions business area decreased by
€0.9 million, or 1.7%, to €52.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €53.4 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019, representing 9.5% of net sales in 2020 as compared to 9.2% in 2019, due to lower
sales, volumes and averages selling prices and an increase in fixed costs partly driven by maintenance activity.
The increase was partially offset by lower variable costs.

_Decor Solutions_

Comparable EBITDA in the Decor Solutions business area increased by €3.1 million, or 9.1%, to
€37.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €34.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019,
representing 10.2% of net sales in 2020 as compared to 8.2% in 2019, due to lower variable costs, partly driven
by higher raw material efficiency, which more than offset the impact of lower selling prices and lower volumes.

_Comparable EBITDA by business area for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018_

From January 1, 2020, we implemented a new business structure under which we reorganized our business

7.1% of net sales in 2019 as compared to 8.2% in 2018, mainly due to lower volumes. Average selling prices
were stable in 2019. The positive impact of lower variable costs was offset by increased fixed costs per ton due to
lower sales and production volumes.

Comparable EBITDA in the Filtration & Performance Solutions business area increased by €8.4 million, or
7.3%, to €123.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €114.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018, representing 18.5% of net sales in 2019 as compared to 17.0% in 2018, mainly due to higher
selling prices and improved operational efficiency, which partially offset the negative impact of lower volumes.

_Industrial Solutions_

Comparable EBITDA in the Industrial Solutions business area decreased by €20.7 million, or 21.5%, to
€75.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from Comparable EBITDA of €96.1 million for the year

consolidated in the results for the full year ended December 31, 2018, representing 11.5% of net sales in 2019 as
compared to 14.4% in 2018. Profitability was mainly impacted by lower volumes in the paper businesses and
lower prices for specialty pulp as well as higher energy costs.

_North America Specialty Solutions_

Comparable EBITDA in the North American Specialty Solutions business area increased by €40.2 million,
or 305.6%, to €53.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from Comparable EBITDA of €13.1 million
for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was mainly due to the acquisitions of Expera Specialty
Solutions and Caieiras in October 2018. Comparable EBITDA in the North American Specialty Solutions
business area decreased by €3.6 million, or 6.4%, to €53.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from
Comparable EBITDA of €57.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as presented based on internal
management reporting giving effect to the impact of the acquisitions of Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras
as if these had been consolidated in the results for the full year ended December 31, 2018, representing 8.3% of
net sales in 2019 as compared to 9.1% in 2018, mainly due to lower volumes and higher fixed costs, partially
offset by higher selling prices.

_Specialties_

Comparable EBITDA in the Specialties business area increased by €8.7 million, or 23.0%, to €46.3 million
for the year ended December 31, 2019, from Comparable EBITDA of €37.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018, representing 8.3% of net sales in 2019 as compared to 6.5% in 2018. Higher selling prices
and improved cost efficiency partly related to the closure of the paper machine, offset lower volumes and
increased variable costs.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

**_Overview_**

Our principal cash requirements consist of Capital expenditures related to investments in operations and
maintenance, upgrades of existing facilities and servicing financial indebtedness and paying taxes.

Our principal sources of liquidity, prior to the Initial Settlement Date, were and are expected to be cash
flows from operating activities and short-term and long-term loans and financing. Following the Initial
Settlement Date, our principal sources of liquidity are expected to be cash flows from operating activities and
financing cash flows from drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility and committed and uncommitted lines.
The availability of the Revolving Credit Facility, will be subject to certain conditions. See “Description of Other
_Indebtedness.”_

Our ability to generate operating cash flows depends on operating performance, which in turn depends to
some extent on general economic, financial, industry, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our

108


-----

control, as well as other factors discussed in “Risk Factors.” We believe that, based on our current level of
operations as reflected in its results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020, cash flows from
operating activities, cash on hand and the availability of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and
committed and uncommitted lines will be sufficient to fund operations and capital expenditures and to debt
service for at least the next twelve months. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and make other
payments to us may be restricted by, among other things, the amount of distributable reserves, legal prohibitions
on such payments or otherwise distributing funds to us, including for the purpose of servicing debt. Losses or
other events could further reduce the net equity and distributable reserves of our subsidiaries.

The financial impact of the pandemic on us was relatively limited in 2020. We have taken numerous actions
across the organization to cushion the short-term financial impact of the expected decline in delivery volumes
and to support our liquidity position, including the implementation of temporary layoffs, reduction of working
hours and the minimization of the use of external personnel and services. We also reduced spending and
postponed certain projects. Members of the Executive Management Team and the CEO took a 50% and 100%
reduction, respectively, on one month’s salary during the second quarter. The Board of Directors also decided to
forgo their compensation for one month in the second quarter. Savings from these actions were approximately
€24 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.

We anticipate that we will maintain a level of debt in line with or not too far from, our opening leverage, for
a period after the Transaction and our ability to generate future financing cash flows will be limited by the
Indenture and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which may have important negative consequences for you.
See “Risk Factors,” “Description of Other Indebtedness” and “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Indebtedness.” In addition, any additional indebtedness that we incur could reduce the amount of_
our cash flows available to make payments on our then existing indebtedness, including under the Notes, and
increase our leverage.

The proceeds from the Offerings of the Notes will be used as set forth under “Use of Proceeds.”

**_Cash Flows_**

2019 and 2018.

(1) We adopted IFRS 16 (Leases) as of January 1, 2019, using the simplified approach. The figures for the periods prior to January 1, 2019
were not restated and, therefore, are not fully comparable. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information Ahlstrom-Munksjo¨—
_Comparability of the Financial Statements—Changes to Accounting Standards—IFRS 16.”_

(2) In October 2018, we acquired Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras. Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras were consolidated into
our historical consolidated financial statements as of their respective acquisition dates. As a result, financial and other information for the
year ended December 31, 2018 is not directly comparable with financial and other information for subsequent periods. See “Presentation
_of Financial and Other Information—Ahlstrom-Munksjo¨—Comparability of the Financial Statements—Acquisitions and Disposals—_
_Acquisitions of Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras.”_

_Net cash from operating activities_

Net cash from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by €31.6 million, or
11.0%, to €255.1 million, from €286.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The net cash during the
year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily supported by the improved result for the period. Working capital
also decreased although not as significantly as in 2019.

Net cash from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by €195.1 million, or
213.1%, to €286.7 million, from €91.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a
reduction in net working capital, including positive changes in trade and other receivables, inventories and trade
and other payables.

_Net cash from investing activities_

Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by €95.0 million, or
55.7%, to €75.4 million, compared to €170.4 million used in the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to
the sale of the fine arts paper business in Arches, France in 2020 and a decrease in purchases of property, plant
and equipment and intangible assets.

Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased by €597.9 million, or
77.8%, to negative €170.4 million, compared to €768.3 million used in the year ended December 31, 2018,
primarily due to a decrease in payments for acquisitions in 2019 as compared to 2018. The acquisitions of Expera
Specialty Solutions and MD Papéis’ Caieiras were completed in 2018 for cash consideration of €524.9 million
and €95.0 million, respectively.

_Net cash from financing activities_

Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by €72.7 million, or
71.0%, to €29.7 million, compared to €102.4 million used in the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily as a
result of primarily the receipt of proceeds from the Pension Loan and a new term loan and lower repayments of
drawings than in 2019.

Net cash from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased by €688.3 million, or
117.5%, to an outflow of €102.4 million, from €585.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily
due to the partial repayment in 2019 of a facility maturing in 2021 and the receipt of borrowings in 2018 from
drawing of certain bank facilities in order to fund the acquisitions of Expera Specialty Solutions and MD Papéis’
Caieiras. This decrease was partially offset by the receipt of proceeds from the hybrid bond issued in 2019.

**_Operating Working Capital_**

We define operating working capital as inventories plus operative receivables before factoring less
operating payables. The following table sets forth operating working capital as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Due to reclassifications between non-operative and operative receivables and payables, the operating working
capital for the year ended December 31, 2019 has changed and is presented on a restated basis. We have
accordingly, not included the operating working capital for the year ended December 31, 2018, as it is not
comparable with the subsequent years.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Financial Risk**

In the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to a variety of financial risks, including credit risk,
funding risk, liquidity risk and market risk.

Our global risk management focuses on uncertainty in the financial markets and aims to minimize potential
adverse effect on our profits. We actively work to reduce the effects of these risks through preventive measures
and, when such preventive measures are not available, we occasionally hedge or insure the risk. Our board of
directors and audit and sustainability committee oversee our risks, and set and approve a treasury policy that
seeks to establish guidelines on how finance and treasury operations and financial risk are managed. Our
executive treasury committee monitors and manages financial risk, while our treasury manages risk
operationally, identifying and evaluating risk. If necessary, measures to mitigate such risks are also identified and
taken. See also “Risk Factors.”

**_Credit Risk_**

Financial instruments that could potentially expose us to counterparty risk consist primarily of trade
receivables, cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments. We are exposed to counterparty
credit risks from financial transactions and customer credit risks.

113


-----

_Financial transactions counterparty credit risk_

Financial transactions counterparty credit risk refers to our exposure under financial contracts arising from
the deterioration of the counterparties’ financial position. In order to minimize this risk, we have the following
guidelines in place in the group finance policy: (i) only entering into transactions with leading financial
institutions and with industrial companies that have a high credit rating (preferably BBB or higher), (ii) only
investing in liquid cash funds with financially secure institutions or companies (preferably BBB or higher) and
(iii) requiring parent company guarantees when dealing with a subsidiary of a rated company.

_Customer credit risk_

Customer credit risk is applied centrally in compliance with existing credit risk management policies and
managed locally in each subsidiary. The principles of customer credit risk management and review are defined,
including thresholds for stopping deliveries to customers in case of overdues. Customer credit exposure is
controlled through credit limits. We employ credit insurance as an additional assurance and other means for
securing payments such as trade finance products.

**_Funding Risk_**

Funding risk refers to the risk that we do not at all times have access to financing or financing at an
acceptable cost. This may arise should we become too dependent on a single source of financing, or if the
maturity structure of our debt portfolio is too concentrated. In order to mitigate funding risk, we aim to spread
our debt across different lenders, different maturities and different forms of financing.

We have outlined the following guidelines in our treasury policy, which aim to mitigate the funding risk.
Historically, we have aimed to ensure that not more than 50% of our debt portfolio will mature in the same
12-month period and the average maturity of the long-term finance should be at least two years. In addition, we
also aimed to avoid the inclusion of financial covenants in all types of financing agreements. Following the
Transactions, we will amend our treasury policy to reflect the debt instruments of the Issuer and their respective
durations, including the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Notes. The Notes and the Senior Term Facilities
will mature within seven years and the Revolving Credit Facility matures six months before the Notes. The
covenants and other terms of the Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are described more fully under
“Description of the Notes” and “Description of Other Indebtedness—The Senior Secured Credit Facilities
_Agreement.”_

**_Liquidity Risk_**

Liquidity risk is the risk that we will not have sufficient funds to pay foreseen and unforeseen expenditures,
including our ability to service and repay our financial liabilities. In order to mitigate this risk, our treasury
monitors our cash pools, bank agreements and liquidity to ensure at all times that there is sufficient liquidity. The
liquidity situation is monitored in such way that we at all times have sufficient liquidity. Our cash accounts are
included in the cash pools.

**_Market Risk_**

Market risks includes currency risk, interest rate risk and commodity risk.

_Currency Risk_

Due to our global operations, we are exposed to currency risk. Currency risk refers to the risk that
fluctuations in the foreign exchange market will negatively affect our cash flow, net result and equity. Currency
exposure, defined as all unhedged exposure in foreign currency, is split into two types of exposure: transaction
exposure and translation exposure. See note 19 to the 2020 Financial Statements for further information on
currency risk and the use of derivative instruments and hedging activities.

_Transaction Exposure_

We manufacture and sell our products globally and are, therefore, exposed to transaction risk. Transaction
exposure arises from commercial and finance-related transactions and payments in a currency other than an
operation’s functional currency (i.e., from internal purchases, sales between manufacturing units and market
companies, external sales and purchases as well as from financing transactions in foreign currencies).

Firm commitments to acquire businesses may also expose us to foreign currency transaction risk.

114


-----

Foreign currency cash flows are hedged on a net exposure basis in accordance with the rules set out in the
Group’s treasury policy. Our risk management strategy in terms of currency risk is to hedge 75% (+/-10%) of the
forecasted cash flows for a period up to nine months if the total exposure to forecasted net flows of foreign
currency exceeds the equivalent of 2% of the total turnover of the company. We use forward contracts to hedge
this commercial foreign currency exposure and apply cash flow hedge accounting. The forward contracts’
maturity is materially reconciled with the timing of the forecasted sales and purchases. As of December 31, 2020,
the fair value of the forwards under hedge accounting was €4.2 million. In 2020, we booked a loss of
€2.1 million to the cash flow hedge transferred to 2020’s result in OCI. We have not historically booked material
ineffectiveness from the hedging relationships, however, ineffectiveness might arise from timing differences.

In addition to using derivatives for hedging, we also employ practical actions in order to reduce the currency
risk. The number of currencies used in intercompany invoicing is minimized and where possible, our treasury
will match foreign exchange cash flows within the Group.

At the end of the reporting period, the hedge ratio for the forecasted cash flows for the next nine months,
including indirect exposure embedded in pulp prices and other adjustments, was approximately 72% as of
December 31, 2020 as compared to approximately 74% as of December 31, 2019 for U.S. dollars and
approximately 82% for SEK as of December 31, 2020 as compared to approximately 67% as of December 31,
2019 and approximately 71% for GBP as of December 31, 2020, which was initiated during 2020. The exposures
in other currencies are limited and not hedged. Outstanding nominal amounts as of the end of 2020 for these
forward contracts were $35 million, SEK 720 million and GBP 16 million, respectively.

Ahlstrom-Munksjö has provided financing (or received deposits) to (from) its foreign subsidiaries which
have been hedged by using forward contracts as of December 31, 2020. Hedge accounting is not applied to these
relationships. The nominal amounts of the loans were $5 million and CNY 25 million, and the nominal amount
of the deposit is JPY 661 million. Additionally, the Company hedges an external loan with a nominal amount of
USD 35 million. These amounts correspond to the nominal amounts of the forward contracts, which have a
maturity of three months and are adjusted according to the open balances. These forward contracts are recognized
at fair value with changes in fair value through the exchange gains and losses within the financial items. The fair
value for the forwards was €0.0 million as of December 31, 2020.

_Translation Exposure_

Our income statement and balance sheet are both exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations, as these affect
the translation of subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.

We have historically aimed to minimize currency risk related to translation exposure by aiming to balance
assets and liabilities of subsidiaries so that the foreign exchange risk is minimized in the consolidated balance
sheet. Due to the long-term nature of net investments, we have not normally performed equity hedging.
Following the Transactions, we expect to naturally hedge U.S. dollar translation risk by designating the USD
Notes and the USD TLB Facility as hedges of our net investments denominated in U.S. dollars.

The following table shows our translation exposure arising from net investments in foreign subsidiaries in
major currencies. For 2018, the table includes also a U.S. dollar-denominated intercompany loan of $365 million
that was accounted for as part of the net investment in a US subsidiary. The loan was converted to equity during
2019.

_Interest Rate Risk_

Interest rate risk refers to the risk that changes in interest rates would have a negative effect on our results
and could affect our long-term competitiveness. There is a risk of interest rates moving both upwards and
downwards. Following the Initial Settlement Date, on an as adjusted basis for the Transactions, the Notes, which
will represent a majority of our debt, will be at fixed interest rates. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities will be at
variable interest rates, which for loans denominated in euros is essentially fixed when the reference interest rate
is below zero, due to the interest rate floor. We regularly monitor our debt portfolio for changes in interest rates.
In order to mitigate interest rate risk, our risk management policy states that our debt portfolio should have an
average fixed term interest of two years with a tolerance of one year. Following the Transactions, we will amend
our treasury policy to reflect the debt instruments of the Issuer, including the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and
the Notes. The Notes and the Senior Term Facilities will mature within seven years and the Revolving Credit
Facility matures six months before the Notes. The covenants and other terms of the Notes and the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities are described more fully under “Description of the Notes” and “Description of Other
_Indebtedness—The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement.”_

_Commodity Risk_

Commodity risk refers to the risk that changes in the cost of raw materials (such as pulp and titanium
dioxide) and energy (such as electricity, gas, oil, etc.) have a negative effect on our results or competitiveness.
We periodically evaluate our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices.

To mitigate commodity risk exposure, we hedge commodity exposure in line with the Group’s treasury
policy. In accordance with this policy, commodity hedging should have a maximum duration of three years and
can cover up to 50% of forecasted consumption during the first year, 40% of forecasted consumption during the
second year and 30% of forecasted consumption during the third year. All hedging transactions are to be related
to a specific project, customer agreement or other directly identifiable business risk in order to avoid speculative
hedging. As of December 31, 2020, we did not have any outstanding commodity derivatives.

**Critical accounting policies**

The preparation of our consolidated annual accounts and related disclosures requires management to make
estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our Financial Statements. Management
must judge and develop estimates for the carrying values of assets and liabilities which are not easily obtainable
from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other
factors considered relevant. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

We periodically review these estimates and underlying assumptions. We recognize the effects of revisions
to accounting estimates in the period that estimates are revised if the revision affects only that period, or also in
later periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. The significant estimates, accounting
judgments and related assumptions for the accounting issues concerned are detailed below.

_Business acquisitions_

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the acquisition is
measured at the fair value of consideration transferred comprising (i) fair value of the assets transferred,
(ii) liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquired business, (iii) equity interests issued as purchase
consideration, (iv) fair value of any contingent consideration arrangement, and (v) fair value of any pre-existing
equity interest in the subsidiary, if applicable.

Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are,
with limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair values and any non-controlling interest in the acquired
entity on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate
share of the acquired entity’s net identifiable assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and
presented as other operating expenses in the income statement with the exception of costs directly attributable to
the issuance of equity instruments that are deducted from equity, net of tax. Any excess of the consideration
transferred over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.

The application of the acquisition method requires certain estimates and assumptions to be made, especially
concerning the fair values of the acquired intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and the liabilities
assumed at the acquisition date, and the useful lives of the acquired intangible assets and property, plant and
equipment.

116


-----

Measurement is based to a large extent on anticipated cash flows. If actual cash flows vary from those used
in calculating fair values, this may materially affect our future results of operations. In particular, the estimation
of discounted cash flows for e.g., customer relationships, technology based assets as well as trademarks and
tradename are based on assumptions concerning, for example, (i) assumptions related to long-term sales
projections and margin development, (ii) determination of appropriate discount rates, (iii) estimates related to
customer retention rates, and (iv) estimates related to appropriate market based royalty rates.

For significant acquisitions, the fair valuation exercise on the acquired assets and assumed liabilities is
carried out with assistance from independent third-party valuation specialists. The valuations are based on the
information available at the acquisition date taking into account the provisional adjustment period allowed under
IFRS of 12 months.

_Share-based payments_

The long-term incentive share based plans have been accounted for as equity settled share-based payments.
This is based on a judgment made by us that the plans will be rewarded in the form of shares and not settled in
cash.

The fair value of the rewards granted in the long-term incentive-share based plans have been estimated at
the grant-date based on the probability of TSR (market) reaching specific thresholds at the end of the
performance period. In order to calculate the probabilities, the most important assumptions that have been made
in the probability weighted value model comprise of required rate of return and annual TSR volatility.

The expense recognized in Employee benefit expenses is based on management’s estimate of the likelihood
of achieving the Comparable EBITDA performance criteria and the estimated number of participants remaining
in the scheme when the vesting period ends.

At the end of each period, management estimates the likelihood of achieving the comparable EBITDA
performance criteria and the expected retention rate for participants in order to calculate the expense for the
current period and the change in the amount recognized in equity. In order to estimate the likelihood of achieving
the comparable EBITDA criteria management considers our comparable EBITDA performance against the target
to date and the forecast for the remainder of the performance period. Management estimate the number of
participants that they expect to remain in the scheme at the end of the vesting period by reviewing the number of
participants remaining at the end of each period, and the expected number of these participants who will remain
at the pay-out date, considering the historic rate of our staff retention.

_Deferred tax assets_

The utilization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and generation of
future taxable profits. We estimate possibilities to use deferred tax assets based on current business plans. We
periodically evaluate status of ongoing tax audits and disputes and positions taken in tax returns with respect to
situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It makes a revaluation of the amounts
recorded, where appropriate, on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities. Because we
operate in complex international tax environment, significant degree of judgement is used in identifying
outcomes of tax audits and disputes and uncertain tax positions.

_Key assumptions used in goodwill impairment testing_

The management makes significant estimates and judgements in determining the level at which the goodwill
is tested and whether there are any indications of impairment.

The calculations of the value-in-use are based on cash flow projections, which require assessments and
estimates from the management. The most significant estimates concern development of net sales and EBITDA
including estimates for market prices of pulp and cost levels of main raw materials and energy as well as
determination of the weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) used to discount cash flows. Management tests
the impacts of changes in significant estimates used in forecasts by sensitivity analyses. COVID-19 has increased
the uncertainty related to cash flow projections as the final impact will depend upon the duration and severity of
the pandemic. In our WACC calculation, we have included an alfa factor amounting to 2.0% to mitigate the risks
relating to future cash flow projections and to the impact of the pandemic.

_Estimates and judgements related to other intangible assets_

For information on the estimation of useful economic life of an intangible asset, see note 8 to the 2020
Financial Statements.

117


-----

_Estimates and judgements related to property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets_

We have tangible and other intangible assets with definite useful lives the values of which are presented in
note 12 to the 2020 Financial Statements. The assets are tested for impairment when there are events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired (i.e., a triggering event). The recoverability of
these assets is based on market assumptions and managements estimate of future cash flows. Changes in
assumptions and failure to meet certain earnings targets could result in impairment. We have considered
triggering events due to COVID-19 and other events and tested the assets for impairment accordingly. For more
details, see note 8 to the 2020 Financial Statements.

_Estimates and judgements related to right-of-use (“ROU”) assets_

We have open ended lease contracts and contacts with extension options. Management uses their best
estimate according to the existing information available to evaluate the most likely end date for these types of
contracts. Changes in the estimated end dates impact the amount of ROU asset and lease liability booked in the
balance sheet.

_Inventory obsolescence_

If the net realizable value of inventory is deemed lower than the cost, then allowance is established for
inventory obsolescence. The amount to be allocated to inventory obsolescence is based on an estimation of the
net realizable value of inventory.

_Defined benefit obligation_

We have various pension schemes in accordance with local practices in different countries. The pension
arrangements are classified as either defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans. The schemes are mostly
funded through payments to insurance companies or trustee-administered funds according to local regulations. A
defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which we, and also typically the employees, pay fixed
contributions to an insurance company. We have no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions
if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay the pension benefits to the employees. Contributions to defined
contribution pension plans are recognized as expense in the period when they incur. All pension plans which do
not meet the criteria for defined contribution plans are defined benefit plans. Defined benefit plans typically
define a fixed amount of benefit that an employee will receive after retirement and for which the company is
responsible.

Our net obligation of defined benefit plans is calculated and recorded separately for each pension scheme
based on calculations prepared by independent actuaries. The present value of defined benefit obligations is
determined using the projected unit credit method. The net liability recognized in the balance sheet is the present
value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of the plan assets. The
discount rate used to determine the present value of the defined benefit obligation is equal to the yield on high
quality corporate bonds or, if not available, government bonds.

The interest rates of the high-quality corporate bonds are determined in the currency in which the benefits
will be paid with a similar maturity to the obligation.

Our net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits, other than pension benefits, is the amount of
future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.

Pension calculations under defined benefit plans include several factors that rely on management estimates:
the discount rate used in calculating pension expenses and obligations for the period, the rate of salary increase
and the rate of future discretionary bonuses decided by the insurance company. Changes in these assumptions can
significantly impact the amounts of pension liability and future pension expenses.

_Environmental_

Environmental provisions are recorded based on current interpretations of environmental laws and
regulations. Such provisions are recognized when it is probable that an obligation has arisen and that the amount
of the obligation can be reliably measured. The amount recognized is the present value of the estimated future
expenditure determined in accordance with local conditions and requirements.

The estimates used in determining the provisions for environmental costs are based on management’s
expectations of, for example (i) timing and scope, (ii) future cost levels and (iii) laws and regulations enacted at
time of the restoration works.

118


-----

The timing of the environmental costs depends on the expected useful lives of our sites. These range from
50 to 70 years. In measuring the future cost levels, we estimate future costs and adjusts these for the effect of
inflation, cost-base development and discounting. The estimated costs are based on current laws and regulations
in place at the time of making the provision.

We utilize a third-party consultant to estimate both the closure and long-term care costs for the landfills. The
estimate is based on the area finally to be capped and the capping materials and activities required along with the
permit and regulatory requirements for closure and post-closure maintenance. These costs are reviewed
periodically by our environmental experts and by a third-party consultant.

Because actual outflows can differ from estimates due to changes in law, regulations, public expectations,
technology, prices and conditions, and can take place many years in the future, the carrying amounts of
provisions are regularly reviewed and adjusted to take into account any such changes. The discount rate used is
reviewed annually.

**INDUSTRY**

**_Overview_**

We produce fiber-based high-performance materials used across a number of niche markets. Although our
offering is fiber-based, the markets we serve have different characteristics compared to commodity paper
markets. The end-markets we serve are more advanced and include medical and healthcare, food and beverage,
and high-performance industrial markets. These markets are generally growing faster than GDP and are
supported by global macro trends such as demographic development and urbanization, globalization,
sustainability and climate change, and digitalization, electrification and automation. In contrast, commodity
paper typically serves newsprint, printing and writing end-markets, which have experienced declining volumes in
the past years. In high performance materials end-markets, our products typically serve critical functions and
provide superior technical performance for our customers, for example, medical fabrics used to construct surgical
gowns and drapes, and face masks, grease-resistant food packaging materials without the use of fluoro chemicals,
or formaldehyde-free abrasive backings. High-performance materials products are sold at significantly higher
price points (€1,000-30,000 per ton as compared to €500 per ton for commodity products), higher margins and
require more investment in research and development compared to commodity paper. The contracting terms in
these markets are also different and allow for significant portion of raw-material pass through.

_Filtration & Performance Solutions_

Filtration & Performance Solutions comprise Filtration, Nonwovens, Glass Fiber Tissue and Abrasive
markets.

_Filtration: The market has been growing at CAGR of approximately 2-3% since 2014, driven by more_
stringent emission regulations globally, and the increasing number of vehicles and buildings, notably in China.
The Filtration market can be split into Automotive & Transportation (42% of value) and Industrial (58% of
value). In Automotive & Transportation, the after-market segment accounts for more than 80% of sales, which
protects the business from the cyclicality of new vehicle sales. Our main competitors are Hollingsworth & Vose,
Neenah and Lydall.

123


-----

Key demand drivers are the steady growth of vehicle fleets, notably in Asia Pacific, driving aftermarket
sales and stricter emission standards globally requiring higher-performance filtration materials. The rise of
electric vehicle offers opportunities (e.g. battery separators, new filter applications) but is not expected to have a
significant impact on revenues due to the company’s strong exposure to aftermarket and to the heavy-duty
vehicles segment.

_Nonwoven: Our market exposure can be divided into plasterboard and high-end wallcover. The plasterboard_
market is growing by approximately 5% per year supported by a shift from paper to glass fiber due to better
performance (e.g. it is weather-proof and thereby allows interior construction work to start before completely
finishing the outside).

The high-end wallcover market is growing at approximately 2-3%, due to strong growth in digital
wallcovering in Europe, North America and Asia. Growth is driven by the availability of personal and trendy
designs. The market has seen positive impact from the COVID-19 pandemic due to an increased share of
spending on home decoration. The consolidated market requires deep production technology know-how to ensure
quality.

_Glass Fiber Tissue: The market is growing by 3-8% driven by commercial and residential construction,_
increased spending on renovations as well as technology advancements and sustainability aspects. In North
America, demand is also underpinned by substitution from other flooring reinforcements such as mineral felt.
The market is consolidated as products are complex and knowledge-intensive. We predominately operate in the
flooring category in which we are a market leader.

_Abrasive: The market is expected to grow in line with GDP, 2-3%. The main drivers of growth are wood-_
working in the furniture industry and automotive aftermarket industries. The market is cyclical due to the large
industrial end-market exposure however that is partly offset by the exposure to furniture. The Do-It-Yourself
segment has been and is expected to continue to be the fastest growing segment in the market. We are a market
leader ahead of our principal competitor, Neenah.

_Advanced Solutions_

Advanced Solution Business Area comprise Liquid Technologies, Beverage & Casing, Medical, Tape, and
Precision Coating markets.

_Liquid Technologies: A high-growth market growing at approximately 7% CAGR, driven by point-of-care_
diagnostic, increase spending in testing for environmental and health monitoring and trend of customized drugs
that require DNA tests. The market has limited cyclicality given resilient end-market exposure. The market is
expected to benefit from significant tailwind due to COVID-19 as there will be additional need for serological
tests. Danaher and Ahlstrom-Munksjö are the two largest competitors in the market.

_Beverage & Casing: The market is growing by 3% per year driven by sustainable tea bag and casing_
materials and single-serve coffee solutions. The main driver behind the tea category growth is further penetration
of teabags in the Asia Pacific region and for the coffee category a switch to paper coffee pods in Europe and the
United States because of conveniences and more environmentally conscious customers are driving the growth.
The market is consolidated with Glatfelter holding a number one position.

_Medical: The market has seen a strong positive effect from COVID-19, with market growth expected to_
double from historical level of 2-3% up to approximately 5%. Market growth has been supported by rise in
infection prevention standards and high-risk surgeries, as well as penetration of sterilization. We believe these
growth drivers are stable and linked to fundamental trends such as increasing medical spending, aging
population, and supports the resilience of the market. The market is fragmented. We hold a position of one to
three globally with Berry being a market leader.

_Tape: The market is expected to grow above GDP driven by increased use of fiber based tapes in China and_
rest of Asia, and increasing level of e-commerce. The market is cyclical due to heavy reliance on construction
and automotive industries; however, the cyclicality has been more than offset by the increasing demand for
packaging tape. The market is very concentrated. We hold a leading position globally.

_Precision Coating: The market is expected to grow 3-8% per year mainly driven by increased adoption of_
co composites in automotive and aerospace industries. The market is cyclical as a consequence of the heavy
reliance on the automotive and aerospace industries. The market is consolidated. We primarily supply the
aerospace industry through sales to converters.

124


-----

_Industrial Solutions_

The Industrial Solutions business area comprises Insulation, Release Liner and Coated Specialties markets.

_Insulation: The market is growing by approximately 1-3% driven by grid renovations due to increased_
renewable energy sources incidence, investments in the Asia Pacific region and increased electric vehicle
penetration. The market’s large exposure to infrastructure makes it resilient to economic cycles although large
one-off projects could lead to some volatility in demand. The market can be divided into cables, transformers and
bushings. We hold a number one to two position in electrotechnical papers segment globally. In transformers,
Weidmann is the market leader, while we have a more limited presence.

_Release Liner: The market is growing at approximately 4% per year mainly driven by an increasing demand_
for release liner used in labels, hygiene products and tapes. The market is resilient to cyclicality due to the
diversified end-industry exposure. We are a market leader in this strategic segment in Europe. The Asia Pacific
region is expected to outgrow the broader market, supported by a growing middle-class population. UPM is the
market leader.

_Coated Specialties: The market is expected to grow at 2-4% per year mainly driven by adoption of pressure-_
sensitive labels and increasing product safety regulations. The market is predominately exposed to primary
consumer goods (e.g., foods and dairy) which results in limited cyclicality.

_Food Packaging & Technical Solutions_

Food Packaging & Technical Solutions comprise of Food Packaging, Technical and Parchment markets.

_Food Packaging: The market we are exposed to is growing 1.5-2.5%, below the broader food paper market_
which is growing 2.5-3% due to our lower exposure to plastic-to-paper substitution and lower Asia Pacific
exposure.

_Technical: The market is growing at 1-2% per year as a result of exposure towards segments growing in line_
with GDP such as industrial and construction.

_Parchment: The market is growing at 1-2% mostly driven by food applications, which represent_
approximately 75% of volumes. Non-food applications include textile tubes, tape and film cores, and furniture
laminates. Market growth is supported by tailwinds related to sustainability, for example vegetable parchment
compared to quilon-coated papers in the United States baking market. Parchment is a specialty product with
attractive differentiation due to superior performance in terms of heat resistance, grease resistance and
re-usability compared to other alternative products. Our Parchment business holds a number one position
globally in the baking and cooking strategic segment.

_Decor Solutions_

The decor market is growing at approximately 3% per year but is a cyclical market due to its end-market
exposure such as construction and furniture. Demand is driven by residential home starts, commercial building
projects and renovation activity as well as rapidly growing middle class in developing markets. We hold a
number two to four position globally in the decor market and our key markets are Europe, North and South
America and selected export markets. Overall, the market is expected to grow broadly in line with GDP, with
China and Asia Pacific regions growing faster than other markets.

**BUSINESS**

**Overview**

We are a global leader in the production of high-performance fiber-based materials for a variety of
consumer and industrial end-uses. Our products are used in a broad range of industrial applications and
consumer-driven products and processes, ranging from everyday consumables, health care and life sciences,
homebuilding and furniture, industrial goods and transportation. Sustainability is central across our businesses,
and with our product offering we facilitate a sustainable everyday life by providing solutions with better
performance, safer materials, fewer resources and a lower environmental impact. Our net sales, operating result,
net result and Comparable EBITDA were €2,683.3 million, €176.2 million, €94.5 million and €334.2 million,
respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020 and our As Adjusted EBITDA was €412.6 million for the
year ended December 31, 2020.

We produce fiber-based materials from pulp and other fibers, and then typically sell such materials to
converters who incorporate them in their end-products. We also produce certain end-products ourselves. Our
product offering includes filter materials, release liners, food and beverage processing and packaging materials,
decor papers, abrasive and tape backings, electrotechnical insulation paper, glass fiber materials, medical fabrics
and solutions for diagnostics, and a range of other specialty materials and pulp for industrial and consumer enduses. We develop our products in close cooperation with customers and other stakeholders in the value-chain,
making use of our high technical expertise and broad experience. We design our custom-made and tailored
materials with a high degree of differentiation to meet and exceed specific customer demands concerning quality
and functionality, adding value for customers.

We target niche markets that benefit from value-based pricing and require technical specialization making it
more challenging for new market entrants. As a niche player, identifying trends and developing new customer
solutions are critical for our business. We have a strong focus on innovation and aim to regularly refresh our
offering and to improve sustainable functionality and design. Our recent innovations include FortiCell[®] launched
in 2020, a new range of fiber-based solutions for energy storage applications using amongst others our DISPRO
foam-forming technology, Extia[®] Protect, a comprehensive range of materials for face masks using fine fiber
technology, and BioWeb[®] and Fiber+ ranges, which use renewable biopolymer polylactic acid for producing
biodegradable and compostable tea bag materials. Our sales from New Products increased to 12% for the year
ended December 31, 2020.

We serve a diverse customer base with more than 6,000 customers in over 100 countries. For the year ended
December 31, 2020, 37% of our sales were to customers in the consumer goods sector, 27% in the homebuilding
and furniture sector, 14% in the transportation sector, 11% in the industrials sector and 11% in the health care
and life sciences sector. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our top-five and top-ten largest customers
generated 13% and 19% of our net sales, respectively.

We manufacture our products globally and have 45 manufacturing plants and converting sites in 14
countries. We consume commodity pulp as part of the manufacturing process. Our commodity pulp consumption
was approximately 1,200 thousand tons for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our pulp exposure was reduced
by approximately 500 thousand tons of our own pulp production during that same period, which includes 185
thousand tons of market pulp production at our Aspa pulp mill in Sweden that is sold to third parties. We believe
that our global manufacturing footprint represents a competitive advantage and would be challenging for new
market entrants to replicate given its specification and scale. Our manufacturing sites are equipped to provide and
apply innovative technology, including FluoroFree[®] capabilities (providing grease resistance without
fluorochemicals), Parchmentizing technology (transforming cellulose to give it plastic-like qualities) and fine
fiber technology with multi-row spinning, which was recently adapted to also produce face masks. We delivered
a total of approximately 1,570 thousand tons of materials in the year ended December 31, 2020. We organize
delivery of our products directly to many of our business-to-business customers using third-party transport
service providers.

We were formed by the merger of Ahlstrom Corporation and Munksjö Oyj on April 1, 2017, which created
a global leader in the production of high-performance fiber-based materials. Our two predecessor companies
have a long history in the Finnish and Swedish forestry and paper industry. Since the merger, we have grown
significantly through the acquisitions of the Caieiras specialty paper mill in Brazil and Expera Specialty
Solutions in North America, each in October 2018.

**Strengths**

**_Leading producer of environmental and sustainability focused high performance fiber-based materials_**
**_requiring technical specialization making it more challenging for new market participants as compared to_**
**_commodity paper_**

We are a leading producer of specialty, high-performance fiber-based materials which contribute to a more
sustainable everyday life. Our specialty products have attractive price points and margins, as we are generally
able to set prices based on value, as compared to the cost-plus pricing of commodity products. In addition, the
specialty, high-performance market is growing in line with the increasing customer focus on health, safety and
sustainability, on which our business is focused, with an expected annual growth of approximately two to five
percent. This growth rate is particularly attractive when compared to commodities. The following table illustrates
the attractive price points based on the higher average selling prices and margins, market growth and average
gross margins of specialty materials as compared to the commodity paper markets.

Sustainability is central across our business. In response to increasing customer focus on sustainability and
demand for sustainable products and solutions, we design and launch solutions with better performance, safer
materials, fewer resources and a lower environmental impact. We provide sustainable and safe food packaging
and focus on compostable and biodegradable solutions. Our mineral oil barrier paper, paraffin wax-free paper,
FluoroFree[®] technology providing fluorochemicals-free grease-resistant papers, tea-bags, flushable wipes and
other products directly cater to a market trend towards more sustainable solutions and respond to stricter food
safety and chemical regulations. We also produce “Plastic Free” products such as plastic-free tea bags, singleserve coffee and casing materials, GenReleaz[™], cards for collection of bio samples, and our CelluStraw[™] an
alternative to the plastic straw. Our “Plastic Free” products provide alternatives to single-use plastics alongside
improved packaging functionality. We also produce recyclable products that help support the circular economy
by reducing waste. We believe increasing customer awareness towards health and safety is also partially driving
the market for our formaldehyde free papers, water purification filter media using its proprietary Disruptor[®]
technology, air and liquid filtration products, facemasks and other products.

Our businesses are also characterized by a high level of technological, customization and qualification
requirements as is required to effectively compete in our relevant markets, which we believe makes it more
challenging for new market participants. Technical and engineered products, in particular, involve manufacturing
complexity, R&D and investment and heightened environmental and safety standards. We operate a global
manufacturing platform, in which we have made significant investments over the prior year, that grants us a
competitive advantage over competitors and that may be hard for competitors to replicate. Product designs for
specific customer specifications, in particular, often require joint product development with the customers and
sometimes take several years to develop. In addition, many of our products require rigorous certifications and/or
long qualification processes, such as certifications for products destined for the aerospace industry and customer
qualification standards for composite release liners and high technical specifications for filter media solutions,
which help to protect our businesses from both conversion risk and other market players. In the year ended
December 31, 2019, we had customers covering 17% of our net sales with whom we had a relationship of over
10 years, demonstrating our ability to produce specialty, high-performance materials to the degree of specificity
and with the certifications that they require.

**_Limited exposure to raw material cost and proven pricing power_**

We have a structured and systematic procurement process and have been able to improve our margin over
variable costs (“MOVC”) during 2020 despite volatility in pulp prices due to the low price sensitivity of our
products and by ensuring commercial excellence, business development, innovation and product development,
cost efficiency and productivity and optimizing our business processes and investments. Our MOVC per ton was
€674, €660, €699 and €721 on average in each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020,
respectively. Our cost base is primarily variable, with variable costs, such as fibers, including pulp, other raw
materials and energy, constituting 65% of our total costs for the year ended December 31, 2020, as detailed
below:

**Fixed costs: ~35%**
**Variable costs: ~65%**

**Other**
**Fixed**

Our commodity pulp consumption was approximately 1,200 thousand tons for the year ended December 31,
2020. Our pulp exposure was reduced by approximately 500 thousand tons of our own pulp production during the
year ended December 31, 2020, which includes 185 thousand tons of market pulp production at our Aspa pulp
mill in Sweden that is sold to third parties. We are typically able to pass through a portion of, or, depending on
the business, the entirety of, any increases in the cost of pulp to our customers by increasing the selling prices of
our products. We typically include contractual or indexed pass-through clauses in our contracts with customers.
For the remainder, we have a strong historical track record of being able to pass through price increases to our
customers, which is possible due to our strong market positions, our exposure to attractive and niche specialty
markets, our value-based pricing approach and the low price sensitivity for many of our products. This low price
sensitivity is the result of our products often being a vital part of our customers’ finished goods and as a result
constitute a relatively low proportion of the overall cost thereof. In addition, our products often perform a key
niche function in the finished good, in contrast to commodity paper, further contributing to low price sensitivity.
The specialized nature of our products also aids in our ability to pass-through increases in raw materials prices as
often they are difficult to replace or substitute. The natural hedge from our own pulp production, combined with
the low price sensitivity of our products and our strong ability to pass-through pulp price increases to customers,
helps to ensure that our profit and cash flows are highly resilient from swings in pulp prices. For instance MOVC
per ton remained relatively stable between 2017 and 2018, decreasing only by 2% or €14 per ton, even though
pulp prices increased by 30% during that period.

In addition, in 2020, we focused on increasing margins and improving overall profitability by initiating cost
savings program. Our €50 million savings program focused on variable cost reduction through procurement
savings and other improvement actions was completed ahead of schedule and exceeded targets. We believe that
our largely variable cost base provides intrinsic resilience to downturns. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic,
we were also able to achieve temporary fixed cost savings of approximately €24 million in the year ended
December 31, 2020, respectively, as a result of measures, such as implementation of temporary layoffs, reduction
of working hours and the minimization of the use of external personnel and services, reduced spending,
postponement of projects and temporary salary decreases. The following chart shows our quarterly performance
in 2019 as compared to 2020, demonstrating our resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic:

**_Diversified business model across customer-base, end-markets and geographies_**

We provide our products and solutions to a diverse base of over 6,000 customers engaged in a variety of
industries, including healthcare & life sciences, engineered industrial products, transportation, food & beverages,
consumer goods, construction and furniture, across more than 100 countries. Our top ten customers generated
19.0% of our net sales in the year ended December 31, 2020, with no single customer representing more than
10% of our net sales. Our top one hundred customers generated 48.3% of our net sales in the year ended
December 31, 2020. Our products serve diverse end markets, which makes our business inherently resilient. In
addition, our products are widely used in industries that are less cyclical and the end-markets for some of our
businesses, such as Medical and Liquid Technologies, are noncyclical, further enhancing our resilience. While
Europe and North America constitute 43.2% and 34.7% of our net sales in the year ended December 31, 2020,
we have also strengthened our presence in South America with our recent acquisition of Caieiras in 2018 and are
currently exploring strategic opportunities in the Decor business in China in order to benefit from market
opportunities and for purposes of managing our portfolio.

Having a diversified business model with high pass-through and internal pulp production provides stability
across macroeconomic cycles as we are cushioned from negative industry trends through our exposure to
multiple industries, which allows greater predictability of overall earnings and growth and resilience to
downturns. For example, the results of operations of each of our predecessors, Ahlstrom Corporation and
Munksjö Oyj remained largely stable during the global financial crisis that began in 2008. Similarly, our
Comparable EBITDA of €334.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 was 6.8% higher than the year
ended December 31, 2019, in spite of the global slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, though net sales
for this period decreased by 8.0% due to adverse currency effects, lower selling prices and a less favorable
product mix. While some of our businesses such as Filtration, Decor, Technical, Insulation and Precision Coating
were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, our Medical business (particularly due to increased
demand for face masks), Liquid Technologies and repurposed activities in our Filtration business, outperformed
prior periods. Diversified exposure in terms of customers, end-market and geography, with high pass-through and

130


-----

internal pulp production, where net short pulp position also mitigates cyclicality, given pulp prices typically are
low when macro activity is low, also contributes to our resilience.

**_Historical high Cash conversion together with strategic deployment of capital to create future capacity_**

We have a track record of profitable growth and free cash flow generation. Our Comparable EBITDA for
the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 was €277.7 million, €312.9 million and €334.2 million,
respectively. Our Free cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 was €205 million,
€225 million, and €254 million, respectively, and our Cash conversion during the same period was 74%, 72%
and 76%, respectively. During the same period, our Capital expenditures were €160.1 million, €161.1 million and
€117.5 million, respectively, our Capital expenditures to net sales ratio was 7%, 6% and 4%, respectively, and
net cash from operating activities was €91.6 million, €286.7 million and €255.1 million, respectively. We believe
that this level of capital expenditure is higher than our long-term Maintenance capital expenditure, which
management estimates to be approximately 3% of net sales per annum, and reflects a temporary, elevated level of
capital expenditures targeting growth in order to better position us to capture further market share. Since 2017,
we have been progressing with our €200 million strategic investment program, which includes investments in
13 projects, aimed at allowing us to increase and improve our production capabilities and providing us with an
opportunity to grow, while retaining attractive cash flows. Of these 13 projects, 11 have been completed, while
the remaining are scheduled to be completed during 2021 and 2022.

A significant proportion of our Capital expenditures in 2018 and 2019 were related to projects undertaken in
the Filtration business in Madisonville, United States, the Abrasive business in Arches, France, the Parchment
business in San Severin, France, and the Coated Specialties business in Jacareí, Brazil, and a boiler and pulp line
rebuild in our plant in Billingsfors, Sweden, part of the Insulation business. Given these significant investments
in increasing capacity and improving manufacturing capabilities, we believe our production facilities are
relatively well-invested and that we are well-positioned to support future growth. We estimate that our
Maintenance capital expenditure is approximately 3% of our net sales, and we estimate that approximately
€90 million of annual capital expenditures (including IT spending) are required to maintain the competitiveness
of our current portfolio which supports our product capability.

**_Significant Transformation Opportunity Leveraging Bain Capital’s Experience from its portfolio company,_**
**_Fedrigoni_**

Bain Capital has a strong track record of driving cost savings and improvements in margin, while at the
same time growing its portfolio companies both organically and through targeted acquisitions. Bain Capital is the
majority shareholder of Fedrigoni, a leading European manufacturer and distributor of pressure sensitive labels
and luxury papers, demonstrating extensive and relevant experience of achieving operational improvements in
the same sector similar to the planned strategies for the Group. Since Fedrigoni’s acquisition by Bain Capital,
Fedrigoni’s sales growth have accelerated, and adjusted EBITDA has doubled, with a focus on increasing organic
growth, successfully integrating a number of bolt-on acquisitions, as well as driving significant operating
improvements through pricing, procurement and operating efficiencies. Fedrigoni has also improved their passthrough of cost of raw materials through pricing optimization. Through competitive sourcing, volumes
optimization and reallocation, volumes planning, supplier cooperation, as well as contract optimization,
Fedrigoni achieved meaningful savings on procurement spend. In addition, through value engineering and recipe
optimization, overall equipment effectiveness debottlenecking, maintenance, repair and operations optimization
and energy efficiency, Fedrigoni achieved meaningful savings on direct costs baseline. Based on Bain Capital’s
tested playbook from Fedrigoni, our Sponsors have identified over €200 million of profit improvement
opportunities and we expect to action approximately €30 million of such opportunities in the next 18 months.

**_Experienced management team with proven execution capabilities supported by our Sponsors_**

We benefit from the industry expertise and know-how of our experienced senior management team, which
has an average of 20 years of experience across the fiber-based materials and forestry industries and provides
leadership across our business areas. Our management team is led by Hans Sohlström, our president and chief
executive officer, who has more than 30 years of experience in the industry, and Sakari Ahdekivi, our deputy
chief executive officer and chief financial officer, who has held senior finance roles in several major companies
across a variety of industries. They are supported by our heads of function and our heads of each business area.

131


-----

Most of our heads of business have had a significant period of association with their business area, including in
their previous roles at Ahlstrom, Munksjö and Expera Specialty Solutions.

Our management team has been instrumental in our growth since the merger of Ahlstrom and Munksjö and
has played a key role in creating efficiencies and a common global culture that fosters cross-business
collaboration. In addition, they have helped us to realize meaningful synergies from acquisitions, including, in
particular, the acquisitions of Caieiras and Expera Specialty Solutions, and they have successfully implemented
global cost saving programs.

We also benefit from the market expertise, business relationships, knowledge and experience of our new
Sponsors. Bain Capital is an active sponsor, both in the broader industrial space, as well as in chemicals,
industrial transformational processes and directly or indirectly, paper and fiber-based materials. Bain Capital has
a strong track record of driving cost savings and improvements in margin, while at the same time growing its
portfolio companies both organically and through targeted acquisitions.

**Strategies**

We and the Sponsors have developed the following strategies:

**_Invest for long-term growth across the business_**

We operate in attractive niche specialty markets and our businesses are well-positioned to capture growth in
their respective markets. All of our sixteen businesses hold leading positions in their strategic segments, with a
majority holding positions as global leaders, while others hold positions as regional leaders. The average market
growth rates of many of the underlying market segments we operate in are growing at or above underlying GDP
rates prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and we expect these markets to continue to grow in the medium-to longterm. We plan to build on this position and capture further market share and to accelerate our growth. We invest
in innovation and product development and we operate extensive research and development capabilities in each
business area. Since 2017, we have been progressing with our €200 million strategic investment program, which
includes investments in 13 projects, aimed at allowing us to increase and improve our production capabilities and
providing us with an opportunity to grow, while retaining attractive cash flows. We plan to continue to drive
growth through selected investments where necessary in our businesses or regions in which we see profitable
growth opportunities.

**_Increase focus on environmental and sustainable specialty materials in line with customer preferences_**

The specialty, high-performance market is growing in line with the increasing customer focus on health,
safety and sustainability with an expected annual growth of approximately two to five percent. Increased
customer focus on environmental and sustainability concerns is causing a significant shift in the preferences for
specialty materials across applications and end uses and continues to drive growth. We believe that we can
significantly benefit from this trend in the mid-term, given our focus on specialty fiber-based materials and our
existing portfolio of sustainable, plastic-free and circular economy focused products. Our new product
development is focused on products that make a positive contribution to sustainability. We will continue to
develop sustainable products focused on moving towards alternatives to traditional plastics. We plan to capitalize
on these opportunities and emphasize the position of our business as an environmental and sustainable leader in
our market segments.

**_Focus on profitability and opportunities to drive further margin improvements_**

We believe there is a significant opportunity to increase profitability by driving further margin
improvements. Prior to the Transactions, we focused on increasing margins and improving overall profitability
with a €50 million savings program targeting variable cost reduction through procurement savings and other
improvement actions, which was completed ahead of schedule and exceeded targets. The Sponsors intend to
continue and expand upon the implementation of certain of our cost savings initiatives from which we expect to
derive significant cost savings and improve our margins. Bain Capital is the majority shareholder of Fedrigoni, a
leading European manufacturer and distributor of pressure sensitive labels and luxury papers. Based on Bain
Capital’s tested playbook for the specialty materials market, as evidenced by the increase in sales and
improvements in the pass-through of cost of raw materials by Bain Capital’s portfolio company, Fedrigoni, we

132


-----

see significant opportunity to further increase the profitability of the business, through areas such as
procurement, pricing, operational efficiency and general cost optimization. In addition to management’s cost
savings program, our Sponsors have identified over €200 million of profit improvement opportunities and we
expect to action approximately €30 million of such opportunities in the next 18 months. See “—Summary
_Consolidated Financial and Other Information—As Adjusted Data of the Issuer.”_

**_Portfolio management through selective acquisition, divestment and other investment opportunities_**

We will continue to consider selective acquisition and divestment opportunities on an on-going basis as they
arise in order to manage our portfolio to focus on enhancing our profitability. As part of our long-term
investment strategy, we continually evaluate potential acquisitions to grow our business in the market segments
we operate, capture market share and accelerate growth. For example, we are currently exploring opportunities to
acquire or invest in Minglian, a Chinese company comprising a greenfield decor paper plant in the city of
Xingtai, Hebei Province, China in order to increase our presence in China, which is the largest decor market. In
addition, we are actively considering strategic alternatives in relation to our entire Decor paper business,
including any potential ownership in Minglian, where one of the options being investigated is the possibility of a
divestment of the Decor business. Our mid-term objective is to refocus the business on higher value segments,
and increase presence in areas where we hold stronger, more differentiated positions.

**History**

**_History of Ahlstrom and Munksjö_**

We were created through the merger of Ahlstrom Corporation and Munksjö Oyj on April 1, 2017. The two
companies trace their roots back to the mid-1800s and the companies have a long history in the Finnish and
Swedish forestry and paper industry. Ahlstrom Corporation was incorporated in Finland in 1908 and traces its
origins to the saw mill, iron and shipping family business of Antti Ahlström established in 1851. The Munksjö
paper mill was founded in Sweden in 1862. On November 7, 2016, the boards of directors of Munksjö Oyj and
Ahlstrom Corporation agreed on combining the two companies and entered into a combination agreement and
executed a merger plan pursuant to which Ahlstrom Corporation would be merged into Munksjö Oyj. The merger
created a global leader in sustainable and innovative fiber-based materials, with leading positions in our main
product areas. The combination strengthened the combined company’s balance sheet allowing room for further
growth and also laid the basis for improved cost efficiencies and the realization of synergies. We have made
significant acquisitions since the merger as described below.

**_Acquisition of Caieiras_**

In April 2018, we entered into an agreement to acquire MD Papéis’ Caieiras specialty paper mill in Brazil
from the Formitex Group, an industrial conglomerate active in the paper, chemicals and panel board industries.
The acquisition strengthened our offering and production platform in South America, and provided attractive
growth opportunities, synergies and further production optimization opportunities for the longer term. The
acquisition was completed on October 17, 2018 for a cash consideration of €96.7 million.

**_Acquisition of Expera Specialty Solutions_**

In July 2018, we signed a share purchase agreement with Specialty Papers Holdings, L.P. pursuant to which
we acquired Expera Specialty Solutions, a U.S. based specialty paper producer. This bolt-on acquisition
expanded our presence in North America and further strengthened our offering of advanced custom-made fiberbased materials. The acquisition was completed on October 10, 2018 for a cash consideration of €524.9 million.

**_Exploring Strategic Alternatives for Decor Business_**

We are actively considering strategic alternatives in relation to our Decor paper business, including
investigating the possibility of a divestment of the Decor business. We are also exploring options to acquire or
invest in Minglian, a Chinese company comprising a greenfield decor paper plant in the city of Xingtai, Hebei
Province, China following the signing of a non-bind letter of intent in 2019. The transaction is subject to further
due diligence, structuring and agreeing final and binding transaction agreements. COVID-19 related lockdowns
and travel restrictions have delayed the negotiations and signing of the transaction, which could happen as early
as during the first half of 2021.

**Business Operations**

**_Overview_**

We are organized into five business areas and reporting segments that are further divided into 16 businesses
as listed below:

   - **Filtration & Performance Solutions: Filtration, Nonwovens, Glass Fiber Tissue, Abrasive**

   - **Advanced Solutions: Liquid Technologies, Beverage & Casing, Medical, Tape, Precision Coating**

   - **Industrial Solutions: Insulation, Release Liners, Coated Specialties**

   - **Food Packaging & Technical Solutions: Food Packaging, Technical, Parchment**

   - **Decor Solutions: Decor**

Our organizational structure promotes our core capabilities and aligns the business characteristics and
targets of each business area. It enables us to strengthen our capabilities in areas of product development and
innovation, global key customer account management and service, product and production technology as well as
process improvement and production optimization. The current organizational structure came into effect in
January 2020 and has resulted in production-related benefits. The structure also serves reporting and governance
purposes.

We manage our businesses with lean group functions such as sourcing, IT, legal and compliance, finance
and human resources. Each business is accountable for its operational and financial performance. Meanwhile, the
Group sets the strategic direction, decides on our priorities and resource allocation and provides support and
economies of scale for the businesses. Recently, we have focused on cross-business collaboration, identifying
new potentials in effective know-how, technology sharing and production optimization.

The following diagram provides an overview of each business area’s net sales for the year ended

**Logistics**

We organize delivery of our products directly to many of our business-to-business customers using thirdparty transport service providers. Transportation is usually conducted by truck, train or ship. We aim to have at
least two transportation service providers per destination and we regularly evaluate our transportation service
provider options.

**Raw Materials and Energy**

_Raw Materials_

We operate in a resource-intensive manufacturing industry and costs and availability of raw materials
impact our performance. Our ability to timely pass price increases on to our customers through increases in the
prices of our products depends on several external factors, such as demand for our products and the negotiation
power of our major suppliers and customers. The most important raw materials are commodity pulp, wood to
produce pulp, other renewable fibers, various synthetic fibers including glass and plastic as well as chemicals
including titanium dioxide and energy. Volatility, price increase and the availability of raw material, particularly
for pulp, impact product margins and our results. We use different types of pulp, such as long, short fiber and
specialty pulps, in our production. Our commodity pulp consumption was approximately 1,200 thousand tons for
the year ended December 31, 2020. Our pulp exposure was reduced by approximately 500 thousand tons of our
own pulp production, which includes 185 thousand tons of market pulp production at our Aspa pulp mill in
Sweden that is sold to third parties. For purchases, there is a structured method to ensure that the procurement
process is complete and systematically designed.

142


-----

We work with a large number of suppliers to secure the high-quality and diverse inputs needed to create our
portfolio of fiber-based solutions. Our fiber suppliers include commodity pulp suppliers, large companies
producing synthetic fibers, and smaller farmers selling niche products such as abaca. We also work with
chemical, equipment, energy, water, and service suppliers on scales from the global to the highly local and
indirect suppliers, such as utilities, transportation services, and equipment and machinery providers. Our largest
procurement categories are managed globally. We strive to increase regional procurement, while balancing the
locally managed share of procurement. Suppliers are evaluated across eight sets of parameters which include
production and financial risks, logistical risks and corporate social responsibility parameters.

A small number of our supply agreements include fixed price commitments, mitigating fluctuations in price.
While raw material costs have generally decreased in 2019 and 2020, some of our raw materials, such as titanium
dioxide, have in the past, experienced significant price fluctuations. We purchase titanium dioxide from a limited
number of suppliers pursuant to long-term contracts.

We use both natural and synthetic fibers in our operations. For the year ended December 31, 2020, 95% of
the fibers used by us were natural (including pulp, abaca, cotton, jute and sisal), and five percent were synthetic
(including glass fiber, polyester and polypropylene, pellets, micro glass and tencel/viscose). We aim to use
renewable materials wherever we can deliver the necessary product performance. Synthetic fibers are at times
required for products to achieve the performance needed by customers. In many cases, synthetic fibers contribute
to the efficiency and lifespan of the end product and help reduce the environmental impact of the end product.

We are also dedicated to supporting more environmentally sustainable fiber production practices, in
particular, for commodity market pulp, which accounted for 88% of our fiber use in the year ended December 31,
2020. In the forest fiber supply chain, the industry generally expects that all forest fiber-based raw materials are
purchased as certified or, at a minimum, as controlled wood for sustainable forest management. By using
certified materials, which are third party audited forest products, we can meet growing customer demand for
sustainable products while contributing to more sustainable forest practices in our supply chain.

Our paper mills Thilmany and Mosinee in the United States and Billingsfors in Sweden are vertically
integrated into pulp production and convert wood into natural pulp. Natural products offer a higher log-to-paper
yield and require less energy and chemicals to process and the raw material also represents a sustainable
approach to production.

_Energy_

Our main sources of energy are electricity, gas, oil and coal. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our
total energy use in Gigajoules (“GJ”) per gross ton production was 26.7 and our total energy cost was
€198.3 million, which was 7.4% of our net sales. Despite modern technology and best practices, the processes of
the manufacturing operations are inherently energy intensive. A lot of energy is required first in pulping to
separate the fibers and after web forming to dry the water out. However, our production sites enhance energy
consumption through several mechanisms. For additional information on efficiencies and initiatives in our energy
use, see “—Environmental, Health and Safety.”

**Research and Development**

We have extensive research and development (“R&D”) capabilities in each business area. R&D in the
business areas is carried out in the production processes at the various plants and in collaboration with customers.
We also operate two R&D facilities in France, one in Pont-Evêque and one in Apprieu. Our innovation and
product development resources have been significantly strengthened through the merger as well as through the
recent acquisitions of Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras, with each company contributing with strong,
complementary innovation and product development knowledge and resources. In addition, marketing, sales and
customer service organizations all form integral parts of the R&D process and help evaluate priority areas,
potential quality improvements, and customer needs. In 2020, our expenditure on R&D, comprising of R&D
expenses and capitalized R&D costs, was €27.2 million, representing 1% of our net sales, excluding technical
product development costs carried out in close cooperation with customers.

Our areas of research include improved sustainability, which involves making existing products more
environmentally friendly by, for example, making them compostable, recyclable or using lower amounts or
different chemicals. For instance, we recently invested in a more sustainable coating machine in Billigsfors,
Sweden, to enable formaldehyde-free balancing and finish foils for furniture as well as the building and
construction industries, with reduced carbon dioxide emissions. We also released OptiLayup[™], an innovative

143


-----

process aid for printed circuit board and copper clad laminate laminating systems, which offers a cost-effective
and sustainable alternative to plastic films traditionally used to protect these tools.

One of our strategic research directions is to develop barrier papers based on biopolymers to offer
biodegradable packaging media. Other areas of research include various forms of nanocellulose, the range of
application of which is wide, and includes strengthening the mechanical properties of fibrous materials or their
functionalization by adding barrier properties. Nanocellulose is also renewable and biodegradable and we expect
it will compete with plastics and other nondegradable materials in many areas. Our objective is to develop new
materials for electrotechnical insulation that can be used by manufacturers of transformers and high voltage
cables. We also focus on researching new biopolymers with the objectives of improving the end-of-life properties
of our products.

Examples of new products launched in the past three years include FortiCell[®] LAB, a new product portfolio
specifically designed for the lead acid battery industry, Spray-Up, with its recent formulation which makes wall
covers easier to take down and change, and 100%Color, a heavy weight decor paper range, which brings more
opportunities for creativity and color options for designers and architects when working with compact laminates.
In the finish foils segment, the M-Foil-PN product was introduced as a new formaldehyde-free pre-impregnated
decor paper concept. In the abrasive backing category, we launched the RE-VOLUTION backing which can
replace cloth with paper and offer high quality finishing and an easier supply chain management for customers
with the ready-to-use backing. The backing is also 100% formaldehyde-free, saving energy and chemicals. We
have also recently developed new food packaging products in collaboration with our customers to address
regulatory concerns about fluorinated chemicals in food packaging. Such products include fluorochemical-free
microwave popcorn packaging and grease and staining resistant packaging for quick service restaurants. We have
also developed compostable paper-based solutions for beverage applications, such as filter papers for tea bags
and lids for the next generation of compostable single use coffee capsules. Innovative solutions are also proposed
on highly technical markets such as life science and forensic with the recent launch of DNA collection and
preservation cards as well as new conjugate pad grades for diagnostics kits.

**Intellectual Property**

We strive to register and actively protect our intellectual property rights, including patents, brands, product
names and trade names in jurisdictions that are relevant to our operations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to
_Our Business and Operations—Failure to establish, manage and protect intellectual property rights could have a_
_material adverse effect on our competitiveness and our business, financial condition and results of operations.”_
In addition, we protect certain manufacturing methods as trade secrets. Our intellectual property rights are
handled centrally.

Our patent portfolio contains mainly patents related to products and manufacturing methods. As of
December 31, 2020, we had in our portfolio around 490 granted patents and 190 patent applications that are
pending in various patent offices across the countries in which we operate.

We have registered the AHLSTROM MUNKSJÖ trademark in the EU as an EU trademark and have filed
applications in several other countries where we are conducting business. The AHLSTROM MUNKSJÖ
trademark has also been registered in the United States, China, India, Brazil, Russia, Australia, Mexico,
Colombia, Chile, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey, Taiwan, Israel and Pakistan. Both the Ahlstrom and the Munksjö
names have a long history in the industry. We target that all of our subsidiaries use the AHLSTROM MUNKSJÖ
trademark in their businesses, and product names are used alongside the AHLSTROM MUNKSJÖ trademark to
clearly identify them with the overall company brand. We have also registered our logo as a trademark in several
of the countries in which we operate.

**Employees**

As of December 31, 2020, we employed, on an average, 7,814 FTE employees. The highest number of
employees were in the United States (31%), France (19%), Sweden (10%), Brazil (9%) and Germany (7%).

We have a European Works Council, which has been established for informing and consulting employee
representatives within the EEA with respect to our operations and developments in matters of a cross-border
nature. In addition, the majority of our employees are represented by labor unions, with which we have collective
bargaining agreements. The agreements provide for additional protection and benefits (e.g., severance
entitlements) of employees, as well as enhanced information and consultation rights of employee representatives
in connection with lay-offs, restructurings, reorganizations and other corporate actions. In some countries,

144


-----

collective agreements have been entered into with local employee representative bodies covering a broad range
of topics, in particular remuneration and working time.

**Environmental, Health and Safety**

We are conscious of our responsibility to advance environmental performance throughout our operations
and supply chains. We are pursuing continuous improvement in our supply chain and sourcing practices,
efficiencies and innovations in our energy and water use, waste reduction and disposal as well as carbon dioxide
emissions reductions. We are also working towards being a zero-accident workplace and contribute to a more
sustainable everyday life.

**_Supply chain and sourcing practices_**

Our Supplier Code of Conduct establishes minimum requirements related to legal compliance, human rights
and the prevention of child labor, health and safety, responsible business, environmental impacts, and
transparency, and our global corporate procurement team is leading efforts to ensure suppliers have signed or are
in compliance with these expectations through regular dialogue with suppliers as well as emerging systems for
risk assessments and field auditing.

We have established metrics and targets to track progress in this area. We have assessed what percentage of
our chemical and fiber suppliers have signed the Supplier Code of Conduct or are considered compliant to set
expectations for responsible sourcing. Currently, we assess that close to 100% of our chemical and fiber suppliers
are on board, are working towards ensuring that all of our significant suppliers are signatories or considered
compliant. The incorporation of the Supplier Code of Conduct in all sourcing tenders is estimated to rapidly
increase the number of companies signing. We create accountability by evaluating the Supplier Code of Conduct
risks and following up with mitigation actions as needed.

**_Efficiencies and innovations in our energy and water use and waste reduction and disposal_**

Our production sites advance energy, water, and waste efficiencies and stewardship through several
mechanisms. Environmental managers at our sites tailor their activities and investments in best available
technologies to meet their particular plant’s local resource management requirements, challenges, and
opportunities. Many plants also advance effective energy and environmental management through third-party
audited, internationally recognized certification systems. As of December 31, 2020, we are ISO 14001 certified
in environmental management at 38 locations. 16 of our plants are ISO 50001 certified in energy management.
We have historically operated and continue to operate landfills at or near certain of our facilities in the United
States. The operation of these landfills requires state permits for operating and closure and the landfills are
subject to continued monitoring. Pursuant to state requirements, we have posted surety bonds for certain landfills,
which serve as financial assurance for the fulfilment of our obligations with respect to potential closure and longterm care costs. As of December 31, 2020, we had six outstanding surety bonds amounting to approximately
$12 million in total. The status of all significant existing or potential environmental issues is reviewed
periodically and we accrue remediation costs when it is probable that such costs will be incurred, and they can be
reasonably estimated.

In addition, we assess our energy use, water use, and water emissions per gross ton of production, as well as
total tons of waste sent to landfill. In the year ended December 31, 2020, our total energy use in GJ per gross ton
production increased by 1.5% to 26.7, partly due to swings in production caused by changing customer demand
due to COVID-19 and our water use in cubic meters per gross ton production reduced by 1% to 72.3. We sent
100,564 tons of non-recoverable waste to landfills in 2020, compared to 98,507 tons in 2019, an increase caused
partly due to challenging weather conditions, which prevented a larger amount from being used in agriculture as
fertilizer and an increase in waste-scoop at the Caieiras mill in Brazil.

**_Carbon dioxide emissions reductions_**

Our activities in Europe are subject to Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and the Council on
industrial emissions (as amended, the “EU Industrial Emissions Directive”) within sectorial emission limits based
on what is considered possible to achieve using the best available technology without considering local
conditions. This may result in new investments or other actions to meet future requirements. The cap on total
annual emissions in the EU will gradually be reduced in phase 4 of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme starting
from 2021, and auctions will become the main method for issuing allowances. Environmental legislation also
requires that the operator who caused the environmental damage has a strict and loyal responsibility to rectify

145


-----

and compensate for the damages and losses suffered. This also applies to properties that the company no longer
owns or carries out operations in. We regularly monitor developments that may change the requirements for
provisions regarding environmental liabilities.

We aim to reduce our products’ impact on the climate by decreasing our carbon dioxide emissions and
dependency on fossil fuels. We have primarily contributed to climate mitigation efforts by pursuing the energy
efficiency work described above. In 2020, our Scope 1 emission, that is, direct greenhouse gas emissions, like
fuel combustion and company vehicles was 1.1 tons of carbon dioxide per gross ton production. Scope 2
emission, or emissions from purchased electricity, heat or steam, during the same period was 0.3 tons of carbon
dioxide per gross ton production.

**_Health & safety_**

We strive towards a zero-accident workplace by setting ambitious targets for continuous improvement,
developing consistent safety practices and competencies at every level, and creating a culture of responsibility
and accountability for all employees, contractors and visitors at our sites.

We have an Occupational Health and Safety Policy, which focuses on preventative activities, behaviorbased safety interactions, safety inspections and auditing, and tailored safety training to ensure a safe working
environment. Local Health & Safety managers lead these activities at sites in coordination with our safety
network of leaders across business areas and sites, the Human Resources team, and the Vice President—
Health & Safety.

To measure our progress in this area, we track three priority indicators: annual total recordable incidents
(“TRI”) rate, near miss rate, and hours of tailored safety training per employee each year. We were able to
achieve a TRI and near miss rate of 1.42 and 6.0, respectively, in 2020. In 2019, these rates were 1.62 and 4.9,
respectively.

We conducted safety trainings for an average of 17 hours per employee in 2020, down from 20 hours in
2019, primarily due to COVID-19 and difficulties in conducting face-to-face trainings.

**_Contributing to a more sustainable everyday life_**

Our sustainability policy defines our formal sustainability governance structure and includes a commitment
to the UN Global Compact and the continuous improvement in the material topics under people, planet and
prosperity. Our sustainability work is governed by the sustainability business council (“SBC”), which includes
representatives from the executive management team, business areas and other functions such as R&D,
communications, legal and procurement. The SBC, which convenes quarterly, oversees the integration of
sustainability practices into business operations. The SBC sets targets and monitors progress set for the material
topics. the SBC also discusses deviations from targets and the introduction of new targets and their management.

Improving sustainability, which involves making existing products more environmentally friendly by
making them compostable, recyclable or using lower amounts or different chemicals, is a high priority for us. We
use an EcoDesign tool to evaluate and assess every new product from a sustainability and product life-cycle
perspective. The criteria include the functionality of the product itself, hazardous chemicals, raw materials,
energy, water, emissions and end of life, which is to say what happens to the product after it has been used. The
assessment also addresses improvement of the sustainability aspects of the end product of which it will be a part.

We were awarded the EcoVadis Gold Rating for our sustainability management and performance for the
fourth consecutive year as a result of our good performance within environmental impact, labor practices, fair
business practices and sustainable procurement. We have policies in place to ensure sustainable forest
management and fiber production practices with the basic premise being that all forest fiber-based raw materials
are purchased as certified or as a minimum controlled wood for sustainable forest management. We carry out an
annual due diligence system to ensure the compliance with the regulations. The system is audited by a third party
and complies with the requirements of SGS wood legality assessment, which covers main legislations, EU
Timber Regulation, US Lacey Act and the Australian Illegal Prohibition Regulation.

**Standards and Certifications**

We hold local permits and comply with regulations in relation to limits for emissions, noise and other
environmental impact caused by our operations. In addition, we adhere to a range of internationally recognized,
third-party audited standards that support our sustainability progress, in order to ensure the responsible

146


-----

management of the production, logistics and distribution processes. We hold a variety of third-party certifications
in relation to, among other things, production quality, environmental, health and safety and energy management
systems, responsible forestry practices, and standards for medical devices and food products.

**Insurance**

We maintain insurance covering property damage, business interruption, product and general liability,
employment practice liability, travelling employees, transported goods, damage caused by crime and directors’
and officers’ liability. We believe that our insurance coverage is consistent with industry practice and is
sufficient for the risks that would normally be associated with our operations, but we cannot guarantee that we
could not be adversely affected by damage or accidents despite possessing said insurance coverage. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Operations—Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient,_
_potentially leaving it uninsured against certain risks.”_

**Litigation**

We are subject to litigation from time to time, in the ordinary course of business. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to Our Business and Operations—Ahlstrom-Munksjö may from time to time be involved in litigation and_
_other similar proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and_
_results of operations.” We are not currently involved in any legal proceedings which, either individually or in the_
aggregate, are expected to have a material adverse impact effect on our business or financial position. However,
the outcome of legal proceedings can be extremely difficult to predict, and we offer no assurances in this regard.

the Initial Settlement Date has occurred and the first utilization of Facility B has been made to complete an
Acquisition (the “Closing Date”) or (y) (unless the percentage ownership that the Issuer directly and/or indirectly
holds in the Company is greater than 90% at such time) after the Closing Date: (A) financing or refinancing
consideration paid or payable for or any cash collateral required to be provided in relation to any Company
Shares pursuant to an Acquisition and/or any acquisition of Company Warrants or treasury shares; or
(B) financing or refinancing any payments to shareholders of the Company pursuant to or in connection with the

Facility drawn solely for this purpose being an “Equity Bridge Revolving Facility Loan” and such bridged
portion of the Equity Contribution being a “Bridged Equity Contribution Amount”) and/or (iv) any other purpose
contemplated by the funds flow statement or the tax structure memorandum, in each case, together with related
fees, costs and expenses (and including, for the avoidance of doubt, as cash over-funding).

**_Availability_**

Facility B has been fully utilized.

The Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized from (and including) the date of the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities Agreement to (and including) the date falling 1 month prior to the maturity date of the Revolving
Credit Facility, provided that the Issuer and US Holdco may only draw a loan under the Revolving Credit Facility
until (and including) the date falling 6 months after the Initial Settlement Date (other than any rollover loan in
respect thereof).

Utilizations of the Original Senior Credit Facilities are subject to customary conditions precedent.

**_Interest and Fees_**

Loans under the Original Senior Credit Facilities will initially bear interest at rates per annum equal to
EURIBOR or, for loans denominated other than in Euro, the applicable IBOR, plus an applicable margin, which
in each case will be subject to a decreasing margin ratchet based on the ratio of consolidated senior secured net
debt to consolidated pro forma EBITDA (each as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement) (the
“Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio”).

If EURIBOR is less than zero, EURIBOR shall be deemed to be zero in respect of loans made under TLB1
or the Revolving Credit Facility (as applicable). If another IBOR, including LIBOR is less than zero, LIBOR
shall be deemed to be zero in respect of loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility or TLB2 (as applicable).

A commitment fee will be payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the Revolving
Credit Facility from the Closing Date to the end of the availability period applicable to the Revolving Credit
Facility at a rate of 30% of the applicable margin for the Revolving Credit Facility. Such commitment fees will
be payable quarterly in arrears (provided that the Issuer may elect that accrued commitment fee shall instead be
paid on each Quarter Date or the last date of each Interest Period applicable to a Facility B), on the last day of the
availability period applicable to the Revolving Credit Facility and on the date the Revolving Credit Facility is
cancelled in full or on the date on which the relevant lender cancels its commitment.

Any letter of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility shall be subject to such issuing bank and
fronting fees as may be agreed between the Company and the applicable issuing bank and a letter of credit fee
equal to the margin that would have been applicable to a cash drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility in the
applicable currency.

Default interest will be calculated as an additional 1% per annum on the defaulted amount.

**_Repayments_**

The loans made under TLB1 will be repaid in full on the date that is seven years from the Closing Date.

The loans made under TLB2 will be repaid in instalments by repaying on each Quarter Date (commencing,
with respect to each Facility B (USD) Loan, with the last day of the first full Financial Quarter ending after the
Closing Date) an amount which reduces the principal amount of such loans drawn during the availability period
by 0.25 per cent of their outstanding principal amount from time to time, with the balance to be repaid in full on
the date that is seven years from the Closing Date.

154


-----

In respect of the Revolving Credit Facility, each advance (other than an Equity Bridge Revolving Facility
Loan will be repaid on the last day of the interest period relating thereto, subject to an ability to roll over cash
drawings. In respect of an Equity Bridge Revolving Facility Loan, an amount equal to the Bridge Equity
Contribution Amount from the proceeds thereof shall be applied in prepayment of such Equity Bridge Revolving
Facility within 45 Business Days of the utilization date thereof (without any break costs). All outstanding
amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility will be repaid on the termination date of the Revolving Credit
Facility, being the date falling six and a half years from the Closing Date. Amounts repaid by the borrowers on
loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility may be reborrowed, subject to certain conditions.

In respect of the letters of credit, each will be repaid on the termination date of the relevant Revolving
Credit Facility, being the date falling six and a half years from the Closing Date (or such earlier date in
accordance with the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement), provided that if any letter of credit has an
expiry date ending on or after the termination date applicable to the applicable Revolving Credit Facility, on such
termination date each letter of credit shall be repaid unless the relevant issuing bank agrees that such letter of
credit shall continue as between that issuing bank and the relevant member of the Senior Secured Group on a
bilateral basis and not as part of or under the documentation for the Senior Secured Facilities.

**_Voluntary and Mandatory Prepayment_**

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement will permit voluntary prepayments to be made (subject to
de minimis amounts) and will require mandatory prepayment in full or in part in certain circumstances,
including:

   - from certain net cash proceeds received by the Issuer and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (the “Senior
Secured Group”) from certain asset disposals, to the extent not otherwise applied for a permitted
purpose and required to be applied in prepayment of the Senior Credit Facilities and subject to a de
minimis amount and other customary carve outs substantially similar to the Notes as described in the
section entitled “Description of the Senior Secured Notes”; and

   - unless otherwise agreed by the majority lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement,
for each financial year (commencing with the first full financial year following the Closing Date), a
percentage of excess cash flow in the event that excess cash flow exceeds a minimum threshold amount
(subject to certain adjustments based on anticipated debt service, distributions to be paid to minority
shareholders and certain other expenses), which percentage decreases as the Senior Secured Net
Leverage Ratio decreases (an “Excess Cash Flow Prepayment”).

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement
which follows terms substantially similar to the Notes as described in the section entitled “Description of the
Senior Secured Notes”), each lender and issuing bank shall be entitled to require prepayment of outstanding
amounts and cancellation of its commitments within a prescribed time period. A change of control shall include:

   - any person or group (other than one or more permitted holders) becoming the beneficial owner of more
than 50% of the voting power of the Issuer other than in connection with a transaction or series of
transactions in which the Issuer shall become the wholly owned subsidiary of a Parent Entity (as
defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement) subject to certain conditions;

   - Topco ceasing to directly own 100% of the total issued share capital of the Issuer (or in each case any
successor entity as a result of certain mergers permitted under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement);

   - on a disposal of all or substantially all the assets of the Senior Secured Group taken as a whole to a
person other than a restricted subsidiary or one or more permitted holders.

At the Issuer’s option, the Issuer may prepay any other indebtedness of the Senior Secured Group which is
permitted (including, junior or junior secured indebtedness) in priority if such prepayment would comply with
the restricted payments covenant.

The Revolving Credit Facility shall not be entitled to any mandatory prepayment proceeds (other than a
mandatory prepayment as a result of a Change of Control).

If a lender waives its right (such right shall be at the Issuer’s request only) to receive its share of any
prepayment of the Senior Secured Facilities (“Waived Amounts”), such Waived Amounts may be retained by the
Senior Secured Group for any purposes not prohibited by the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement
(including restricted payments), may be offered to any lender(s) selected by the Issuer which did not decline such
prepayment or applied in prepayment of any other permitted indebtedness.

**_Guarantees and Security_**

_Guarantor Coverage Test and Material Subsidiaries_

The Senior Secured Facilities will be guaranteed by each borrower of the Senior Secured Facilities (the
“Borrowers”) and the Guarantors (together, the “Senior Secured Obligors”).

Subject to the agreed security principles in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the following
security was granted a condition precedent to the availability of the Original Senior Credit Facilities: (a) Topco
granted limited recourse (i) Finnish law share pledge in respect of its shares in the capital of the Issuer and
(ii) Finnish law security agreement assigning any structural intercompany receivables owed to Topco (as lender)
by the Issuer (as borrower); (b) the Issuer granted: (i) a New York law share pledge in respect of its shares in US
Holdco; and (ii) a Finnish law bank account pledge agreement pledging its material bank accounts in Finland

in any Material Subsidiary (as defined below) incorporated or organized in the US, provided that no obligation of
any US Obligor (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement) shall be secured by a Material
Subsidiary (A) that is a “controlled foreign corporation” within the meaning of Section 957(a) of the Code, that is
owned (within the meaning of Section 958(a) of the Code) by a member of the Group that is a “United States
Shareholder” (as defined in Section 951(b) of the Code), (B) all the assets of which consist of equity interests (or
equity interests and indebtedness) of one or more entities described in clause (A), and (C) that is a subsidiary of
an entity described in clause (A) or (B).

The Issuer has also granted a Finnish law governed book-entry account pledge agreement in favor of the
Security Agent in respect of the book-entries relating to the shares in the Target it owns at the time of such grant
of security.

Subject to certain adjustments and agreed security principles in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement, the Issuer is required to ensure that members of the Senior Secured Group incorporated in a Guarantor
Jurisdiction (i) that generate at least 80% of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the section entitled “Description
of the Senior Secured Notes”) of the Senior Secured Group within certain agreed jurisdictions (“Guarantor
Jurisdictions”), namely, Australia, Canada, any member state of the EU, Hong Kong, Iceland, New Zealand,
Norway, Singapore, Switzerland, the UK and the US (including any state thereof and the District of Columbia) and
the jurisdiction of incorporation of any borrower (the “Guarantor Coverage Test”) and (ii) (A) is an Obligor; or

be delivered to the agent under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement.

As part of the guarantor accession process, security shall be granted (subject to the agreed security
principles): (a) over the shares of such acceding guarantor by a wholly owned Material Subsidiary who is its
shareholder incorporated in a Guarantor Jurisdiction; and (b) if the relevant acceding guarantor is incorporated in
(i) Australia, Canada, Finland, Hong Kong, New Zealand, the Republic of Ireland, Singapore, the United
Kingdom or the United States shall grant floating security over substantially all assets located in its jurisdiction
of incorporation (subject to customary exclusions, “excluded assets” including real estate) and in each case only
to the extent to do so would not have a material adverse effect on the ability of the relevant company to conduct
their business and operations (as determined by such company in its sole and absolute discretion).

In addition to the circumstances described below under “—Intercreditor Agreement—Distressed Disposals”
and “—Intercreditor Agreement—Non-distressed Disposals,” the Issuer may, subject to certain conditions,
request the release of a guarantor from its guarantee under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement if
(i) such guarantor is the subject of a third-party disposal or other permitted activity under the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities Agreement pursuant to which such guarantor will cease to be a member of the Senior Secured
Group, (ii) on a pro forma basis taking into account such release, the Guarantor Coverage Test will continue to be
satisfied or (iii) the lenders whose commitments under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement aggregate

156


-----

greater than 50% of the total commitments under such facilities consent to such release. Upon the effectiveness
of a release pursuant to the foregoing sentence, the applicable guarantor would have no further obligations under
the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, including any obligations to grant Security in any Collateral
owned by such guarantor.

The provision and the terms of the security and guarantees set forth above will in all cases be subject to
certain limitations and are at all times and in all cases subject to the requirements of applicable law and the other
matters set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement.

Certain representations and warranties were made on the Closing Date and will be repeated on the date of
each utilization, on the first day of each interest period and at certain other times.

**_Springing Financial Covenant_**

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement contains a springing senior secured net leverage financial
covenant (“Financial Covenant”) solely for the benefit of the lenders participating in the Revolving Credit
Facility and any applicable Incremental Senior Secured Facilities (together the “Financial Covenant Facilities”),
set at a flat ratio whereby the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio as set out in the relevant compliance certificate
delivered to the agent under Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement shall not exceed 7.75:1

The Financial Covenant will be on an LTM basis on each financial quarter date on or after the first testing
date (a “Test Date”), provided that the Senior Secured Group will only be required to test the Financial Covenant
if as of 5.00 p.m. (in London) on a Test Date, the amount of: (a) all loans under the Financial Covenant Facilities
(excluding: (i) loans to fund any original issue discount or flex-related payments with respect to Facility B and
any Incremental Senior Secured Facility which is a term facility; (ii) loans made on or prior to the Closing Date
(and, in each case, any rollover loan in respect thereof)) and (iii) (for the avoidance of doubt) any amounts drawn
under the Revolving Credit Facility by way of ancillary facilities and letters of credit (or bank guarantees));
minus (b) any cash and cash equivalent investments of the Senior Secured Group, exceeding 40% of the
aggregate of: (i) the total commitments of the Revolving Credit Facility as at the date of the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities Agreement; and (ii) the aggregate of all commitments under any Incremental Senior Secured
Facility which is a revolving facility and a Financial Covenant Facility established after the date of the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, (disregarding, in each case, any reduction in such commitments following
the establishment thereof) (the “Test Condition”).

The Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio is based on the definitions and adjustments in the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities Agreement, which may differ from similar definitions in the Indenture and the equivalent
definitions described in this offering memorandum.

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement contains an equity cure provision enabling the Issuer to
cure or prevent breaches of the Financial Covenant (an “Equity Cure”) by the contribution from its shareholders
or any other person of additional equity, assets and/or subordinated loans (“Cure Amount”) to (i) increase the
consolidated pro forma EBITDA under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, (“EBITDA Cure”) (ii)
decrease consolidated senior secured net debt as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, or
(iii) prepay the Revolving Credit Facility (“Prepayment Cure”) so that the Test Condition is no longer satisfied.
The EBITDA Cure equity cure right may not be exercised on more than five occasions during the term of the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and no more than two EBITDA Cures may be made in any three
consecutive relevant periods. Such Equity Cure must be exercised prior to the date falling 20 Business Days after
the date on which the compliance certificate is required to be delivered.

There shall be no obligation to use any Cure Amount (other than with respect to a Prepayment Cure) in
prepayment of the Senior Secured Facilities.

If the Financial Covenant has been breached, but is complied with when tested on any subsequent Test Date
or is otherwise not required to be tested due to the Test Condition not being met on any subsequent date, then, the

157


-----

prior breach of such Financial Covenant or any event of default arising therefrom shall be deemed cured unless
the requisite super-majority lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility have exercised their acceleration rights
to declare all or part of the loans under the Revolving Credit Facility to be immediately due and payable.

The Issuer may elect to re-test the Test Condition or Financial Covenant for any period at any time based
upon any financial statements (including the latest internally available financial information for an LTM period)
and, if the Test Condition is not met or the Financial Covenant is complied with at such time (due to prepayments
of the RCF, cash or cash equivalents on balance sheet or otherwise), the Financial Covenant shall be deemed
complied with and any prior breach of such Financial Covenant or any Event of Default arising therefrom shall
be deemed cured. For any such calculation, the Issuer may give pro forma effect to all applicable transactions
(and permitted adjustments to any Applicable Metric in connection therewith) for which the Applicable
Transaction Date has occurred following the end of the Applicable Period or any subsequent Relevant Period as
if such Applicable Transaction had been consummated on the first day of such Applicable Period or Relevant
Period (as applicable)

Senior Secured Revolving Facilities (the “Super-majority Revolving Facility Lenders”) may exercise
acceleration rights as a result of such breach and (B) if the Super-majority Revolving Facility Lenders have
exercised such acceleration rights as a result of such breach, the remaining lenders shall have a right of crossacceleration; (ii) misrepresentation; (iii) invalidity and unlawfulness of the Senior Secured Facilities financing

**_Governing Law_**

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in
connection with it, are governed by, construed in accordance with and will be enforced in accordance with
English law although the restrictive covenants, events of default and related definitions scheduled to the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities Agreement will be interpreted in accordance with New York law (without prejudice to
the fact that the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement is governed by English law).

**Intercreditor Agreement**

**_General_**

To establish the relative rights of certain of our creditors under our financing arrangements, the Issuer,
certain Guarantors and the Trustee are party to and certain other Guarantors will accede to an Intercreditor
Agreement between, among others, the agent, arrangers and lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement and the Security Agent.

By accepting a Note, holders of the Notes will be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the terms and
conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by English law and sets out various matters governing the
relationship of the creditors to our group including the relative ranking of certain debt of the Issuer, the
Guarantors and any other person that becomes party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Debtor or Third Party
Security Provider (as defined below), when payments can be made in respect of debt of the Debtors or Third
Party Security Providers, when enforcement action can be taken in respect of that debt, the terms pursuant to
which certain of that debt will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events and turnover
provisions and provisions related to the enforcement of shared security.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions contained in the Intercreditor Agreement. It
does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety and we urge you to read that document because it, and
not the description that follows, defines certain rights of the holders of the Notes and of the Trustees. Capitalized
terms used but not defined herein have the meanings given to them in the Intercreditor Agreement.

For the purposes of this description:

“Senior Secured Group” shall mean the Issuer and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries.

securities or other debt instruments issued or to be issued by or in relation to which a New Debt Financing has
been made available to or by a Topco Borrower (as defined below) which are designated by the Issuer as Topco

Liabilities” to refer to the Notes and certain other indebtedness of the Issuer.

may be carried forward and utilized in the subsequent financial year (where it shall be deemed to have
been used first)), (G) of any amount of the Topco Liabilities which would have been payable but for
the issue of a Topco Payment Stop Notice (which has since expired and no new Topco Payment Stop
Notice is outstanding) which has been capitalized and added to the principal amount of the Topco
Liabilities or where that amount is outstanding as a result of the accrual of cash interest payable in
respect of the Topco Liabilities during such period or any such amount described at (i)(C) above,
provided that no such payment may be made if certain events of default have occurred under the Senior
Secured Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities or would occur as a result of making such payment,
(H) for as long as an event of default under the Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or
Topco Group Liabilities which is continuing, all or part of the Topco Liabilities being released or
otherwise discharged solely in consideration for the issues of shares in any holding company of the
Issuer (“Debt for Equity Swap”) provided that no cash or cash equivalent payment is made in respect of
the Topco Liabilities, that it does not result in a Change of Control as defined in any prior ranking
finance agreement or Topco Finance Document and that any Liabilities owed by a member of the
Senior Secured Group to another member of the Senior Secured Group, to the Subordinated Creditors
or to any other holding company of the Issuer that arise as a result of any such Debt for Equity Swap
are subordinated to the Senior Secured Liabilities and Second Lien Liabilities pursuant to the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Creditors and Second Lien Creditors are granted

proceeds received by the Topco Borrower from the Senior Secured Group without breaching the terms
of the Debt Documents, (M) if the payment is of a principal amount of the Topco Liabilities and made
in accordance with a provision in a Topco Finance Document relating to prepayment upon illegality or
any other provision that permits the repayment in full of any Topco Creditor (without a related
requirement to repay all other Topco Creditors) and (N) if no Senior Secured Payment Default or
Second Lien Payment Default has occurred and is continuing and the payment is a payment of

-----

principal, interest or any other amounts made on or after the final maturity date of the relevant Topco

relevant Topco Finance Document as of the date of first issuance or borrowing (as the case may be) of
the applicable Topco Liabilities); or

(iii) if the requisite Senior Secured Creditors, Super Senior Creditors and Second Lien Creditors give prior
consent to that payment being made.

On or after the Priority Discharge Date, the Debtors, the Topco Borrowers and the Third Party Security
Providers may make payments in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities in accordance with the Topco Finance
Documents and the Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (as applicable).

_Topco Liabilities Payment Block Provisions_

A Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding from the date falling one (1) Business Day
after the date on which, following the occurrence of an event of default under any Senior Secured Liabilities (a
“Senior Secured Event of Default”) or an event of default under the Second Lien Liabilities (a “Second Lien
Event of Default”), the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the requisite Super Senior Creditors, Senior
Secured Creditors or Second Lien Creditors gave the instructions for the relevant stop notice to be delivered) (a
“Topco Payment Stop Notice”) to the agent under any Topco Facility (the “Topco Agent”) and the trustee under
any Topco Notes (the “Topco Notes Trustee”) advising that the Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien
Event of Default is continuing and suspending payments by the Senior Secured Group of the Topco Liabilities,
until the first to occur of:

(i) the date falling one hundred and seventy nine (179) days after delivery of that Topco Payment Stop
Notice;

(ii) the date on which a default occurs for failure to pay principal at the original scheduled maturity of the
relevant Topco Liabilities;

(iii) if a Topco Standstill Period (as defined below) commences after delivery of that Topco Payment Stop
Notice, the date on which such standstill period expires;

(iv) the date on which the relevant Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien Event of Default has
been remedied or waived;

(v) the date on which the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of whichever of the Super Senior
Creditors, Senior Secured Creditors or Second Lien Creditors gave the instructions for the relevant stop
notice to be delivered) delivers a notice to the Topco Borrower, the Topco Agent and the Topco Notes
Trustee cancelling the payment stop notice;

(vi) the Priority Discharge Date; and

(vii) the date on which the Topco Creditors take any enforcement action that is permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement (see “—Permitted Topco Enforcement” below).

No Topco Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by the Security Agent in reliance on a Senior Secured
Event of Default or a Second Lien Event of Default more than forty five (45) days after the occurrence of the
relevant event of default. No more than one Topco Payment Stop Notice may be served (i) with respect to the
same event or set of circumstances, or (ii) in any period of three hundred and sixty (360) days.

Any failure to make a payment due in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities as a result of the issue of a
Topco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment
Default shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an event of default as a consequence of that failure to make a
payment in relation to the relevant Topco Group Liabilities, or (ii) the issue of an enforcement notice in respect
of an event of default under the finance documents documenting any Topco Group Liabilities (a “Topco
Enforcement Notice”) on behalf of the Topco Creditors.

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

Nothing in the Second Lien or Topco payment block provisions will release any Debtor from the liability to
make any payment (including of default interest, which shall continue to accrue) under the applicable Debt
Documents even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time. The accrual and capitalization of
interest (if any) in accordance with the applicable Debt Documents shall continue notwithstanding the issue of a
payment stop notice.

167


-----

**_Cure of Payment Stop_**

If:

(i) at any time following the issue of a Topco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured
Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default, that Topco Payment Stop Notice ceases to be
outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment
Default ceases to be continuing; and

(ii) the relevant Debtor or Topco Borrower then promptly pays to the Topco Creditors or any party that has
acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement as a creditor under a Topco Proceeds Loan (the “Topco
Investors”) (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) an amount equal to any payments
which had accrued under the Topco Finance Documents or the Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (as
applicable) and which would have been Permitted Topco Payments but for that Topco Payment Stop
Notice or Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default (as the case may be),

(A) then any event of default which may have occurred under a Topco Finance Document or Topco
Proceeds Loan Agreement and any Topco Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a
result of that suspension of payments shall be deemed automatically waived without any further
action being required.

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, at any time prior to the latest
to occur of the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Second Lien Discharge
Date and the first date on which all of the Topco Liabilities have been fully discharged (the “Topco Discharge
Date”) (the “Final Discharge Date”) any creditor (other than a Senior Secured Creditor on or after the
Designation Date) receives or recovers from any Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party
Security Provider:

(i) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the
creditors under the Debt Documents other than any payment or distribution which is either (x) not
prohibited under the Intercreditor Agreement or (y) made in accordance with the provisions set out
below under “—Application of Proceeds”;

(ii) any amount by way of set-off which does not give effect to a payment permitted under the Intercreditor
Agreement;

(iii) any amount:

(A) on account of, or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the creditors under the Debt
Documents (I) after the occurrence of an acceleration event or the enforcement of any Transaction
Security as a result of such an acceleration event, or (II) as a result of any other litigation or a
Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or any Third Party Security Provider (other than
after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event); or

(B) by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it after the occurrence of an
acceleration event or the enforcement of any Transaction Security as a result of such an
acceleration event, other than, in each case, any amount received or recovered in accordance with
the provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds”;

(iv) the proceeds of any enforcement of any of the Transaction Security except in accordance with the
provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds”; or

(v) any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities
owed by any Debtor, any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider which
is not in accordance with the provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds” and which is
made as a result of, or after, the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in respect of that Debtor, member
of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider,

that creditor will:

(vi) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off (x) hold an amount of
that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or if less, the amount received or recovered) on
trust for (or otherwise on behalf and for the account of) the Security Agent and promptly pay or
distribute that amount to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, and (y) promptly pay or distribute an amount equal to the amount (if any) by

168


-----

which the receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities to the Security Agent for application in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(vii) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an amount
equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

A turnover mechanism on substantially the same terms applies in the event that, at any time on or after the
Designation Date but prior to the Final Discharge Date, any Senior Secured Creditor receives or recovers from
any Debtor, any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider (x) any proceeds from the
enforcement of security or from a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) or following an acceleration event or
the enforcement of security, any proceeds arising from any of the charged property or (y) any other amounts
which should otherwise be received or recovered by the Security Agent except in accordance with the provisions
set out below under “—Application of Proceeds.”

**_Effect of Insolvency Event_**

“Insolvency Event” is defined as, in relation to any Debtor, Material Subsidiary (each as defined in the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement) or Third Party Security Provider, (a) the passing of any resolution or
making of an order for insolvency, bankruptcy, winding up, dissolution, administration or reorganization
(excluding solvent reorganizations), (b) a moratorium is declared in relation to any of its indebtedness, (c) the
appointment of a liquidator, receiver, administrative receiver, administrator, compulsory manager or other
similar officer in respect of it or any of its assets, or (d) any analogous procedure or step is taken in any
jurisdiction, other than (in each case), frivolous or vexatious proceedings, proceedings or appointments which the
Security Agent is satisfied will be withdrawn or unsuccessful or as permitted under any Senior Secured Credit
Facility Agreement or in any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted Super Senior Secured
Facilities Agreement or a Second Lien Facility Agreement, or otherwise not constituting a default.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any party entitled to
receive a distribution out of the assets of a Debtor, Material Subsidiary or Third Party Security Provider (in the
case of a Senior Secured Creditor on or after the Designation Date, only to the extent such amounts constitute
proceeds of enforcement) shall direct the person responsible for the distribution to pay that distribution to the
Security Agent until the liabilities owing to the Secured Parties have been paid in full. The Security Agent shall
apply all such distributions paid to it in accordance with the provisions set out under “—Application of
_Proceeds” below._

To the extent that any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider’s liabilities to
creditors are, with certain exceptions, discharged by way of set-off (mandatory or otherwise and in the case of a
Senior Secured Creditor on or after the Designation Date, only to the extent such amounts constitute proceeds of
enforcement) after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any creditor benefiting from such set-off shall pay an
amount equal to the amount of the liabilities owed to it which are discharged by that set-off to the Security Agent
for application in accordance with the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” below.

If the Security Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in
respect of any liabilities, the liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the extent that
the realization proceeds are actually applied towards such liabilities.

Subject to certain netting and set-off rights under ancillary or cash management facilities, each creditor
irrevocably authorizes the Security Agent to take Enforcement Action (as defined below), make demands, collect
and receive distributions, file claims and take other actions necessary to make recovery after the occurrence of an
Insolvency Event in relation to a Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider.
The creditors agree to do all things the Security Agent reasonably requests in order to give effect to these
provisions.

**_Security Enforcement Regime_**

_Enforcement of Security_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent may not take any action to enforce the
Transaction Security or the Topco Independent Transaction Security without the prior written consent of an
Instructing Group, Majority Second Lien Creditors or Majority Topco Creditors (as applicable) otherwise as
specified in the provisions described below.

169


-----

An “Instructing Group” means:

(a) if the Designation Date has not occurred:

(i) prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors;

(ii) on or after the Senior Secured Discharge Date but before the Priority Discharge Date, the Majority
Second Lien Creditors; and

(iii) on or after the Priority Discharge Date but before the Topco Discharge Date, the Majority Topco
Creditors; and

(b) at any time on or after the occurrence of the Designation Date and:

(i) prior to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the first date on which the Super
Senior Liabilities have been fully and finally discharged (the “Super Senior Discharge Date”),
Senior Secured Creditors (other than the Super Senior Creditors) representing more than fifty
(50)% of the Senior Secured Liabilities (other than the Super Senior Liabilities) (the “Majority
Senior Secured Creditors”), and Super Senior Creditors representing more than fifty (50)% of the
Super Senior Secured Liabilities (the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”) save that, for
instructions relating to enforcement, it shall mean the group of Secured Creditors entitled to give
instructions in accordance with the enforcement regime described under “—Enforcement of
Transaction Security Prior to the Designation Date” and “—Enforcement of Transaction Security
on or After the Designation Date” below;

(ii) on or after the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge Date
but before the Priority Discharge Date, Second Lien Creditors representing more than fifty (50)%
of the Second Lien Liabilities (the “Majority Second Lien Creditors”); and

(iii) on or after the Priority Discharge Date but before the Topco Discharge Date, Topco Creditors
representing more than fifty (50)% of the Topco Liabilities (the “Majority Topco Creditors”).

_Enforcement of Transaction Security Prior to the Designation Date_

Prior to the Designation Date, the Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security
unless instructed otherwise by (i) the Instructing Group, (ii) if, prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the
Instructing Group has (A) given no instructions or has instructed the Security Agent neither to enforce or cease
enforcing and (B) not required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal (as
defined below), an agent or trustee under the Second Lien Liabilities (acting on the instructions of the Majority
Second Lien Creditors) where the rights of the Second Lien Creditors to enforce have arisen under the
Intercreditor Agreement, or (iii) if, prior to the Priority Discharge Date, the Instructing Group (or Majority
Second Lien Creditors as applicable) have (A) given no instructions or have instructed the Security Agent neither
to enforce or cease enforcing and (B) not required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a
Distressed Disposal, a Topco Agent or the Topco Notes Trustee (acting on the instructions of the Majority Topco
Creditors).

Subject to the Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms, the Instructing
Group or any other persons entitled to give instructions in accordance with the preceding paragraph may give or
refrain from giving instructions to the Security Agent to enforce, or refrain from enforcing, the Transaction
Security as they see fit. Notwithstanding the above paragraphs, if at any time the agents or representatives of the
Second Lien Creditors or Topco Creditors then entitled to give the Security Agent instructions to enforce the
Transaction Security do not give such instruction or do not indicate any intention to give such instruction, then
the Instructing Group may give instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security as the
Instructing Group sees fit and the Security Agent shall act on such instructions received from the Instructing
Group.

Unless (i) the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an Insolvency Event or (ii) the
Instructing Group or any agent of the creditors represented in the Instructing Group determines in good faith that
to do so could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce
the Transaction Security or the realization proceeds of any such enforcement, before giving any such instructions
to enforce the Transaction Security or take any other enforcement action the creditors represented by an
Instructing Group will be required to consult with each other agent (provided that any agent in respect of Topco
Liabilities need only be consulted if such enforcement relates to Topco Shared Security) for a period of up to ten

170


-----

Business Days or take any Enforcement Action (the “Consultation Period”) and the Instructing Group will only
be entitled to give the enforcement instructions described above or take any Enforcement Action after the expiry
of such Consultation Period.

_Enforcement of Transaction Security on or After the Designation Date_

On or after the Designation Date, the Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security
unless instructed otherwise in accordance with the provisions described in this paragraph. If the Transaction
Security has become enforceable, if either the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors wish to issue enforcement instructions they shall deliver a copy of those instructions (an “Initial
Enforcement Notice”) to the Security Agent and to the other agents, trustees and hedge counterparties.

The Security Agent will act in accordance with any instructions (provided they are consistent with the
Enforcement Principles (as defined below)) received from (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, (ii) if the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to
instruct the Security Agent to pursue within three months of the Initial Enforcement Notice or the Super Senior
Discharge has not occurred within six months of the Initial Enforcement Notice, the Majority Super Senior
Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (iii) if an Insolvency Event (other than an
Insolvency Event directly caused by enforcement action taken at the request of a Super Senior Creditor) is
continuing, the Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (iv) if the Majority
Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct
the Security Agent to pursue and the Majority Super Senior Creditors determine in good faith that a delay could
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce the
Transaction Security or on the realization of proceeds and the Majority Super Senior Creditors deliver
instructions before the Security Agent has received any instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors,
the Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (v) if, prior to the later
of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors (as applicable) have not given instructions or they have
instructed the Security Agent (A) not to enforce or cease enforcing or (B) required any Debtor or Third Party
Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, any agent or trustee in relation to the Second Lien Liabilities
(the “Second Lien Agent”) (acting on the instructions of the Majority Second Lien Creditors) where the rights of
the Second Lien Creditors to enforce have arisen under the Intercreditor Agreement, or (vi) if, prior to the
Priority Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the
Majority Second Lien Creditors (as applicable) have not given instructions or they have instructed the Security
Agent (A) not to enforce or cease enforcing or (B) required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make
a Distressed Disposal an agent or trustee under the Topco Finance Documents (acting on the instructions of the
Majority Topco Creditors). Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, if at any time the agents or representatives
of the Second Lien Creditors or Topco Creditors then entitled to give the Security Agent instructions do not give
such instruction and do not indicate any intention to give such instruction, then the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors or Majority Super Senior Creditors to the extent that such group is entitled to give enforcement
instructions as described in the paragraph above may give instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the
Transaction Security as they see fit and the Security Agent shall act on such instructions.

(i) “Enforcement Principles” means certain requirements as to the manner of enforcement, including that
to the extent consistent with a prompt and expeditious realization of value, the method of enforcement
chosen should maximize the value realized from such enforcement, (ii) certain proceeds must be
received in cash, and (iii) enforcement in relation to assets over €5,000,000 or shares if not carried out
by way of a public auction or other competitive sales process, shall (if the Security Agent is so
requested by the Majority Super Senior Creditors or Majority Senior Secured Creditors) benefit from a
fairness opinion from an investment bank, firm of accountants or third party financial adviser.

_Enforcement—Topco Independent Transaction Security_

Subject to the Topco Independent Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its
terms, an agent or trustee under the Topco Finance Documents (acting on the instructions of the Majority Topco
Creditors) may give or refrain giving, instructions to the Security Agent to enforce or refrain from enforcing the
Topco Independent Transaction Security as they see fit.

171


-----

_Manner of Enforcement_

If the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is being enforced in accordance with
any of the above paragraphs, the Security Agent shall enforce the relevant Transaction Security or Topco
Independent Transaction Security in such manner (including the selection of any administrator of any Debtor or
Third Party Security Provider to be appointed by the Security Agent) as any persons entitled at any time under
the above provisions shall instruct it or, in the absence of any such instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit
(which may include taking no action).

No Secured Party shall have any independent power to enforce, or to have recourse to, any of the
Transaction Security or to exercise any right, power, authority or discretion arising under the Security
Documents except through the Security Agent.

_Security Held by Other Creditors_

If any Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is held by a creditor other than the
Security Agent, then creditors may only enforce that Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction
Security in accordance with instructions given by instructing creditors in accordance with the paragraphs above.

_Payment of the French Soulte_

If, following the enforcement of any shares or securities pledged under a Security Document governed by
French law by way of appropriation or foreclosure (a “Foreclosure”), a French Soulte (being the amount by
which the value of the shares or securities being appropriated, foreclosed or transferred exceeds the amount of
the relevant secured obligations) becomes due to any Debtor by a Secured Party, such French Soulte shall only
become due and payable by the Secured Parties on the earlier of the date falling nine (9) months after the date on
which such Foreclosure occurs and the Final Discharge Date.

**_Enforcement Regime_**

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Second Lien Creditors_

Certain of the features set out below with respect to Topco Creditors may apply to the Second Lien
Creditors, with appropriate modifications for the relative position in the capital structure.

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Topco Creditors_

Until the Priority Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of or as required by an Instructing Group,

announced restructuring or turnaround plan or while a default was outstanding under the relevant
Secured Debt Document ); or

(vi) petitioning, applying, voting for or taking steps (including the appointment of any liquidator, receiver,

_Permitted Topco Enforcement_

The restrictions set out above under “—Restrictions on Enforcement by Topco Creditors” will not apply in

(i) an event of default under a Topco Finance Document or a Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (the
“Relevant Topco Default”) is continuing;

(ii) all agents or trustees in respect of the Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, and
Second Lien Liabilities have received a notice of the Relevant Topco Default specifying the event or
circumstance in relation to the Relevant Topco Default from the Topco Agent, the Topco Notes Trustee
or the Topco Borrower;

(iii) a Topco Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and

(iv) the Relevant Topco Default is continuing at the end of that Topco Standstill Period.

173


-----

Promptly upon becoming aware of an event of default under a Topco Finance Document, a Topco Notes
Trustee, Topco Agent or Topco Investor (as the case may be) may give a Topco Enforcement Notice notifying
any agent under a Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement (the “Senior Agent”), Senior Secured Notes
Trustee, the Second Lien Agent and any second lien notes trustee of the existence of such event of default.

“Topco Standstill Period” means the period beginning on the date (the “Topco Standstill Start Date”) a
Topco Enforcement Notice is served in respect of such a Relevant Topco Default and ending on the earliest to
occur of:

(v) the date falling one hundred and seventy nine (179) days after the Topco Standstill Start Date (the
“Topco Standstill Period”);

_Option to Purchase: Topco Creditors_

Following acceleration or the enforcement of Transaction Security upon acceleration under any Senior
Secured Creditor Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities, Topco Creditors may, by giving not

Lender Liabilities, Super Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Cash Management Facility
Liabilities, Second Lien Lender Liabilities and Second Lien Notes Liabilities for the amount that would have
been required to prepay or redeem such liabilities on such date plus certain costs and expenses. Topco Creditors
must also elect for the counterparties to hedging obligations to transfer their hedging obligations to holders in
exchange (subject to specified conditions) for the amount that would have been payable under such hedging
obligations had they been terminated on such date plus certain costs and expenses in connection with any such
purchase.

**_Non-Distressed Disposals_**

The Security Agent (on behalf of itself and the other Secured Parties) and each other person party to a
Transaction Security document or a Topco Independent Transaction Security document agrees that it shall (and is
irrevocably authorized, instructed and obliged to do so without further consent, agreement, instruction, direction,
confirmation, payment, certification or other document, request or information from any creditor, other Secured
Party or Debtor) promptly following receipt of a written request from the Issuer to the Security Agent:

(i) release (or procure the release) from the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction
Security and the Secured Debt Documents:

(A) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any asset which the Issuer
has confirmed is the subject of:

(1) a disposal not prohibited under the Finance Documents or where any applicable release and/ or consent
has been obtained under the applicable Finance Document including a disposal to a member of the
Senior Secured Group but without prejudice to any obligation of any member of the Senior Secured
Group in a Finance Document to provide replacement security; or

(2) any other transaction not prohibited by the Finance Documents or where any applicable release and/or
consent has been obtained under the applicable Finance Document pursuant to which that asset will
cease to be held or owned by a member of the Senior Secured Group; and

in each case where such disposal is not a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) (in each case, a
“Non-Distressed Disposal”);

(B) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any document or other
agreement requested in order for any member of the Senior Secured Group to the extent that
the Issuer has confirmed that such action is not prohibited by any Finance Document to effect
any amendment or waiver or otherwise exercise any rights, comply with any obligations or
take any action in relation to such document or agreement;

(C) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any asset of any member of
the Senior Secured Group which has ceased or will cease to be a Debtor or guarantor
simultaneously with such release to the extent that the Issuer has confirmed that such ceasing to
be a Debtor or guarantor in accordance with the terms of each Finance Document or the Agreed
Security Principles (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement); and

(D) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any other asset to the

release is otherwise, in accordance with the terms of any Finance Document or the Agreed
Security Principles (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement);

(ii) in the case of a disposal of share or ownership interests in a Debtor, other member of the Senior

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraphs (i)(A), (i)(B) and (ii) above, the Issuer shall
confirm in writing to the Security Agent, that the relevant disposal or other action is not prohibited as at the date
of completion of such release or, at the option of the Issuer, on the date that the definitive agreement for such
disposal or similar transaction is entered into.

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraph (i)(C) or (i)(D) above, the Issuer shall confirm
in writing to the Security Agent, that such security is not required to be given or the relevant release or cessation

to the extent the Issuer has confirmed to the Security Agent that such disposal or other transaction or designation
is not prohibited by the Finance Documents, if such member of the Topco Group or a Debtor is a borrower,
issuer or primary debtor under any Debt Document, such person shall have the right to voluntarily prepay all
liabilities outstanding under any Debt Document to the applicable creditors concurrently with ceasing to be a
member of the Topco Group or Debtor; and any right to decline, delay or prevent any prepayment in any Debt
Document shall be disapplied to the extent that if exercised such right would prevent the repayment of all such
liabilities in full by such person (but without prejudice to any prepayment fees, make-whole payment, break costs
or other payment required by the relevant Finance Documents).

The Issuer may at any time require that all of the rights and obligations of any borrower of Super Senior
Liabilities, Senior Lender Liabilities, Cash Management Facility Liabilities or Second Lien Lender Liabilities

Borrower (a “Debt Transfer”) provided that (i) either (A) such Debt Transfer is to another member of the Senior
Secured Group; (b) such Debt Transfer is by a Borrower where (I) that Borrower or any holding company of that
Borrower is being disposed of in accordance with the Finance Documents, and (II) the proceeds of such disposal
are not otherwise required to be applied unconditionally in prepayment of that Borrower’s liabilities under the
applicable Finance Documents; or (C) such Debt Transfer is undertaken in connection with an IPO, and (ii) the
transferee in respect of such Debt Transfer is another borrower under the Super Senior Liabilities, Senior Lender
Liabilities, Cash Management Facility Liabilities or Second Lien lender Liabilities (as applicable). Any Debt
Transfer may (and shall upon the request of the Issuer) be effected on a cashless basis, by way of book entries
and not as physical cash movement to repay and reborrow any applicable liabilities.

**_Distressed Disposals_**

“Distressed Disposal” means a disposal of an asset or shares of, or other financial securities issued by a
member of the Senior Secured Group or, in the case of a Third Party Security Provider, any assets or shares or
financial securities which are subject to the Transaction Security which is being effected (a) at the request of an
Instructing Group in circumstances where the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an
acceleration event which was continuing at the time the request for enforcement was made, (b) by enforcement of
the Transaction Security as a result of an acceleration event which was continuing at the time the request for
enforcement was made, or (c) after the occurrence of an acceleration event which has occurred and is continuing
or the enforcement of any Transaction Security as a result of an acceleration event which has occurred and is
continuing, by a Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to a person or persons which is not a member of the
Senior Secured Group.

If a Distressed Disposal of any asset is being effected, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (subject
to acting in accordance with certain conditions set out below) at the cost of the relevant Debtor, Third Party
Security Provider and the Issuer and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any
creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement, Third Party Security Provider or Debtor:

(i) to release the Transaction Security or any other claim over that asset and execute and deliver or enter
into any release of that Transaction Security or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallization of any
floating charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be
considered necessary or desirable;

(ii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor to release (A) that Debtor
and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities;
(B) any Transaction Security granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of that Debtor over any of its
assets, and (C) any other claim of an intra-group lender, a Topco Investor, Subordinated Creditor or
another Debtor over that Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf
of the relevant creditors, Third Party Security Providers and Debtors;

(iii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a Debtor to
release (A) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or any part of its
borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities; (B) any Transaction Security granted by that holding company
or any subsidiary of that holding company over any of its assets, and (C) any other claim of an intragroup lender, a Topco Investor, Subordinated Creditor or a Debtor over that holding company’s assets
or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf of the relevant creditors and Debtors;

(iv) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of
a Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to

176


-----

dispose of all or any part of the liabilities owed by such Debtor or holding company or any of their
subsidiaries to creditors or other Debtors:

(A) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does not intend that
any transferee of those liabilities (the “Transferee”) will be treated as a Secured Creditor or a
Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement) to execute and deliver or enter into
any agreement to dispose of all or part of those liabilities, provided that, notwithstanding any
other provision of any Debt Document, the Transferee shall not be treated as a Secured Creditor or
Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(B) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does intend that
any Transferee will be treated as a Secured Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the
Intercreditor Agreement) to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all (and
not part only) of the liabilities owed to the Secured Creditors and all or part of any other liabilities,

on behalf of, in each case, the relevant creditors, Third Party Security Providers and Debtors;

(v) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of
a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the “Receiving Entity”) all or any part of the
Disposed Entity’s obligations or any obligations of a subsidiary of that Disposed Entity in respect of
the intra-group liabilities or liabilities owed to any Debtor, to execute and deliver or enter into any
agreement to:

(A) transfer all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or liabilities to any
Debtor on behalf of the relevant intra-group lenders and Debtors to which those obligations are
owed and on behalf of the Debtors which owe those obligations; and

(B) (provided that the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which is also a
Guarantor of the Senior Secured Liabilities) to accept the transfer of all or part of the obligations
in respect of those intra-group liabilities, liabilities owed to Debtors on behalf of the Receiving
Entity or Receiving Entities to which the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or
liabilities owed to Debtors are to be transferred.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities as described
above) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out under
“—Application of Proceeds” below as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of the Transaction
Security and, to the extent that any disposal of liabilities has occurred, as if that disposal of liabilities had not
occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities) effected by, or at the request of, the Security
Agent, the Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing market
conditions (although the Security Agent shall not have any obligation to postpone any such Distressed Disposal
or disposal of liabilities in order to achieve a higher price).

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Second Lien Creditors are entitled to
give and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is not
authorized to release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities, guarantee
liabilities or any other liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor unless those borrowing liabilities,
guarantee liabilities or any other liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full
(or, in the case of any contingent liability relating to a letter of credit, cash management facility or an ancillary
facility, made the subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant senior creditor) immediately
following that release.

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Topco Creditors are entitled to give,
and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is not authorized
to release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities or any
other liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor or any Second Lien Creditor unless those borrowing
liabilities, guarantee liabilities or any other liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien
Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent liability relating to a letter of credit,
cash management facility or an ancillary facility, made the subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to
the relevant senior creditor) immediately following that release.

irrevocably authorized (at the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Issuer and without any consent, sanction,
authority or further confirmation from any creditor or Debtor) to execute such documents as are required to so
transfer those borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities.

Subject to the provisions described below, if a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities pursuant to

regularly engaged in providing valuations of businesses or assets similar or comparable to those subject
to the relevant Transaction Security) and, in each case, not being an auditor or administrator or other
relevant officer of the applicable company (a “Financial Advisor”) as selected by the Security Agent (it

until it has been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction), in respect of which the
Secured Creditors are entitled to participate (a “Competitive Sales Process”); or (B) where a Financial
Adviser selected by the Security Agent has delivered an opinion (including an enterprise valuation of the

security under documents creating security in respect of the Secured Obligations in respect of the
assets of such members of the Senior Secured Group is simultaneously and unconditionally
released and discharged concurrently with such sale, provided that, if each Senior Agent and Senior
Secured Notes Trustee (acting reasonably and in good faith) determines that the Senior Secured
Creditors will recover a greater cash amount if such Relevant Claim is sold or otherwise transferred
to the purchaser or its affiliates and not released or discharged and provided such amount is
nevertheless less than the aggregate amount of outstanding Senior Secured Liabilities, which shall
be deemed to be the case if there are no bidders) or if each Senior Agent and Senior Secured Notes
Trustee (acting reasonably and in good faith) determines that there are no bona fide and fully
committed bids in cash or substantially all in cash in excess of the outstanding amount of Senior
Secured Liabilities and serves a written notice on the Security Agent confirming the same, then the
Security Agent shall be entitled immediately to sell and transfer such Relevant Claim to the

due to any creditor (“Equitably Subordinated Creditor”) whose commitments, any other participation rights
(including by way of sub-participation) and/or any other rights and claims under the Debt Documents against a
Debtor incorporated in Germany which, prior to or in an insolvency of the Debtor, would be subordinated or
would be subject to avoidance claims pursuant to certain provisions under the German Insolvency Code or the
German Avoidance Act (unless other applicable laws or regulations in force from time to time provide that no
such subordination would apply or avoidance claim would exist) (“Equitably Subordinated Liabilities”) being
part of that class of creditors, the amount to be applied by the Security Agent in discharge of the liabilities of that
class of creditors shall be distributed first to the other creditors of that class until the liabilities owed to such
creditors in the class of creditors of the Equitably Subordinated Creditor have been discharged in full and then to
that Equitably Subordinated Creditor.

An Equitably Subordinated Creditor will not have the benefit (but will still be subject to the obligations
under any sharing or equalization or turnover provisions in the Debt Documents) and will not be entitled to
receive any payment or distribution and neither the Security Agent nor the agent nor any creditor shall be
required to make any payment or distribution or turnover under or in connection with the Debt Documents in
respect of any Equitably Subordinated Liabilities, in each case until the liabilities owed to the other creditors in
the class of creditors of the Equitably Subordinated Creditor have been discharged in full.

To the extent that any Equitably Subordinated Liabilities would result in the subordination of liabilities
towards any other creditors under any Debt Document or prejudice the validity or enforceability of any
Transaction Security or guarantee and/or indemnity provided to any creditor under the Debt Documents in any
way (in each case unless other applicable laws or regulations in force from time to time provide that no such
subordination would apply or be prejudicial for the validity or enforceability of any Transaction Security or
guarantee and/or indemnity), the relevant Equitably Subordinated Creditor will be deemed not to be a Secured
Party under any document creating Transaction Security and will not benefit from the guarantee or indemnity.

**Equalization**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, for any reason, any liabilities relating to Super Senior
Liabilities, Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities remain unpaid after the first
date on which certain types of Enforcement Action are taken (the “Enforcement Date”) and the resulting losses
are not borne by the creditors in any given specified class in the proportions which their respective exposures at
the Enforcement Date bore to the aggregate exposures of all the creditors in that specified class at the
Enforcement Date, the relevant class of creditors will make such payments amongst themselves as the Security
Agent shall require to put the relevant creditors in such a position that (after taking into account such payments)
those losses are borne in those proportions.

**Required Consents**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, subject to certain exceptions, its terms may be amended or
waived only with the consent of the Issuer, the agents and trustees for the Secured Parties, and the Security
Agent, provided that, to the extent that an amendment, waiver or consent only affects one class of creditors, and
such amendment, waiver or consent could not reasonably be expected materially or adversely to affect the
interests of the other classes of creditors, only written agreement from the relevant agent or trustee acting on
behalf of the affected class (or in the case of hedging counterparties, each affected hedge counterparty) shall be
required.

182


-----

An amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor Agreement that has the effect of changing or which relates to,
among other matters, the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” above and the order of priority or
subordination under the Intercreditor Agreement shall not be made without the consent of

(i) each of the agents or trustees (acting in accordance with the relevant finance documents) under the
Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities,

(ii) each Cash Management Facility Lender (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver
would materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of such Cash Management Facility Lender
under the Intercreditor Agreement and would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations
of any other creditor or class of creditors other than the Cash Management Facility Lenders (solely in
their capacity as such)),

(iii) each hedge counterparty (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would materially
adversely affect the rights and obligations of such hedge counterparty under the Intercreditor
Agreement and would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other creditor or
class of creditors other than the hedge counterparties (solely in their capacity as such)), and

(iv) the Issuer.

Each agent or trustee shall, to the extent instructed to consent by the requisite percentage of creditors it
represents or as otherwise authorized by the Debt Documents to which it is party, act on such instructions or
authorizations in accordance therewith (save to the extent any amendments so consented or authorized to relate to
any provision affecting the personal rights and obligations of that agent or trustee in its capacity as such).

**_Amendments and Waivers: Transaction Security Documents_**

Subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement (as described below), the Security Agent
(a) may, if the Issuer consents, amend the terms of, release or waive any of the requirements of or grant consents
under, any document creating Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security which shall be
binding on each party, and (b) may if the Issuer consents, and shall promptly upon request of the Issuer, amend,
release and/or retake any document creating Transaction Security where such amendment, release and/or retake
is required in order to ensure the validity, perfection or priority of the relevant Transaction Security, together
with any related or consequential waiver (including by reason of a failure to register any relevant document with
Companies House within the prescribed time limit set out in section 859 of the Companies Act 2006, in which
case the Security Agent shall also irrevocably waive any payment or other obligation or default arising out of
such failure to register) and any such amendment, release, waiver and retake shall be binding on each Party.

Where any such amendment, release or waiver of, or consent under, any document creating Transaction
Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security would adversely affect the nature or scope of the assets
subject to Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (as the case may be) or the manner in
which the proceeds of enforcement of the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security are
distributed, such amendment may not be made without the prior consent of:

(i) each of the agents or trustees other than an agent under any Cash Management Facility, if appointed
(acting in accordance with the relevant finance documents) under the Senior Liabilities, the Super
Senior Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities,

(ii) each Cash Management Facility Lender or the agent for the relevant Cash Management Facility on its
behalf but only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would materially adversely affect
the rights and obligations of such Cash Management Facility Lender under the Intercreditor Agreement
in their capacity as such and would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any
other creditor or class of creditors,

(iii) each hedge counterparty (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would materially
adversely affect the rights and obligations of such hedge counterparty under the under the Intercreditor
Agreement and would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other creditor or
class of creditors other than the hedge counterparties (solely in their capacity as such)), and

(iv) the Issuer.

**_Exceptions_**

Subject to the paragraph below, an amendment, waiver or consent which relates to the rights or obligations
which are personal to an agent, an arranger or the Security Agent in its capacity as such (including any ability of

183


-----

that Security Agent to act in its discretion under the Intercreditor Agreement) may not be effected without the
consent of that agent, arranger or, as the case may be, Security Agent.

The preceding paragraph and the first paragraph above under “—Amendments and Waivers: Transaction
_Security Documents” are subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement, relating in particular to_

(i) any release of Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security, claims or liabilities, or
(ii) to any amendment waiver or consent, which, in each case, the Security Agent gives in accordance
with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement relating to the incurrence of additional or
refinancing debt or the provisions set out under “—New Debt Financings,” “—Non-Distressed
_Disposals” and “—Distressed Disposals” above. Any release, amendment, waiver or consent effected_
in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Debt Documents relating to such matters can be
effected solely by the Issuer and the Security Agent.

**_Snooze/Lose_**

_If in relation to:_

(i) a request for a consent in relation to any of the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (or any other Debt
Document other than a notes indenture which does not contain a similar snooze/lose provision or which
applies a longer period than that specified in the Intercreditor Agreement);

(ii) a request to participate in any vote of a class of creditors under the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement (or any other Debt Document other than a notes indenture which does not contain a similar
snooze/lose provision or which applies a longer period than that specified in the Intercreditor
Agreement);

(iii) a request to approve any other action under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (or any other Debt
Document other than a notes indenture which does not contain a similar snooze/lose provision or which
applies a longer period than that specified in the Intercreditor Agreement); or

(iv) a request to provide any confirmation or notification under the Intercreditor Agreement (or any other
Debt Document other than a notes indenture which does not contain a similar snooze/lose provision or
which applies a longer period than that specified in the Intercreditor Agreement),

then, in each case, any creditor:

(A) fails to respond to that request within ten (10) Business Days (or any other period of time notified
by the Company, with the prior agreement of the Agents if the period for this provision to operate
is less than ten (10) Business Days) of that request being made; or

(B) fails to provide details of its participation within the timescale specified by the Security Agent:

1. in the case of paragraphs (i) to (iii) above, that the creditor’s participation (as the case may
be) shall be deemed to be zero for the purpose of calculating their participation in respect of
the matter when ascertaining whether any relevant percentage (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, unamity) of their participation or has been obtained to give that consent, carry that
vote or approve that action;

2. in the case of paragraphs (i) to (iii) above, that the creditor’s status shall be disregarded for
the purposes of ascertaining whether the agreement of any specified group of creditors has
been obtained to give that consent, carry that vote or approve that action; and

3. in the case of paragraph (iv) above, that confirmation or notification shall be deemed to have
been given,

provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, this Snooze/Loose clause shall not apply to any Noteholder in
respect of any request where such Noteholder is not given the option to respond to such request in the negative
but shall otherwise apply to all Noteholders.

**_Provisions Following an IPO_**

On or following an initial public offering of a member of the Senior Secured Group (or a holding company
thereof) (an “IPO Event”), the Issuer is entitled to give notice to each agent and each hedge counterparty (a
“Pushdown Notice”) that the terms of the Debt Documents will automatically operate (with effect from the date

184


-----

specified in the relevant Pushdown Notice (the “IPO Pushdown Date”)) so that, amongst other things, (i) the
Senior Secured Group (and all related provisions) will now refer to the member of the Senior Secured Group or
holding company of the Issuer who will issue shares or whose shares are to be sold pursuant to such IPO (the
“IPO Pushdown Entity,” and if any Topco Notes are not refinanced in full on or before the IPO Pushdown Date,
the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be any holding company of the Issuer which is the issuer or borrower of any

holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity and all reporting obligations shall be assumed at the level of the
IPO Pushdown Entity, (iii) each reference in the Debt Documents to the Issuer or any holding company of the

and from the Transaction Security (other than, in each case, borrowing liabilities). Each party to the Intercreditor
Agreement shall be required to enter into any amendment, release or replacement of any Debt Document required

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

The following is a description of the €650,000,000 (equivalent) in aggregate principal amount of Senior
Secured Notes due 2028, consisting of €400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of % Senior Secured
Notes due 2028 (the “Euro Notes”) and the €250,000,000 (equivalent) aggregate principal amount of %
Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the “Dollar Notes” and, together with the Euro Notes, the “Notes”). The Notes
will be issued by Spa Holdings 3 Oy, a limited company organized and existing under the laws of Finland (the
“Issuer”). For purposes of this “Description of the Notes,” (i) the “Issuer” refers only to Spa Holdings 3 Oy, and
none of its subsidiaries, (ii) the “Company” refers to Ahlstrom-Munksjö Oyj, and “A-M Group” refers to the
Company, together with its Subsidiaries, and (iii) “Group” refers to the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries.

The proceeds from the offering of the Notes issued on the Issue Date will be used by the Issuer, together
with certain proceeds from Facility B and cash, to (i) refinance certain amounts borrowed under the Bridge
Facilities, which were used, together with the proceeds from the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the
Equity Contribution and other cash sources, to finance the Acquisitions, to repay or refinance the certain existing
debt and obligations of the Group, to deposit in the Pref Instrument Overfunding Escrow Account, as cash
overfunding and pay certain fees and expenses in connection therewith, and (ii) pay fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the offering of Notes, as set forth in this Offering Memorandum under the caption “Summary—
_The Transactions—Sources and Uses for the Acquisitions” and “Use of Proceeds.” Upon the initial issuance of_
the Notes on the Issue Date, the Notes will only be obligations of the Issuer and the Initial Guarantor (as defined
below) and will not be guaranteed by any other Subsidiary of the Issuer. The Post Squeeze-Out Guarantors will,
within 120 days from the Business Day immediately after the Squeeze-Out Completion Date, subject to the
Agreed Security Principles and to certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, accede to the Indenture
(as defined below) and the Intercreditor Agreement and guarantee the Notes on a senior secured basis.

The Issuer will issue the Notes under an indenture (the “Indenture”), to be dated as of the Issue Date,
among, inter alios, the Issuer, the Initial Guarantor, U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as trustee (the “Trustee”), and
GLAS Trust Corporation Limited, as security agent (the “Security Agent”). The Notes will be issued in a private
transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. See “Notice to Investors.”
The Notes are subject to all such terms pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, and Holders are referred to
the Indenture for a statement thereof.

The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture and refers to the Notes, the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Transaction Security Documents. Because this is a summary, it may not contain
all the information that is important to you. You should read each of the Indenture, the Notes, the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Transaction Security Documents in their entirety. Copies of such documents are available as
described under “Where You Can Find Other Information.” The capitalized terms defined in “—Certain
_Definitions” below are used in this “Description of the Notes” as so defined._

The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements (as defined below), and in the case of a conflict between the Indenture, the Notes or the Transaction
Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement will prevail. The
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the relative ranking of indebtedness and
security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, the procedures for undertaking enforcement
action, the subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees, and the
payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—
_Intercreditor Agreement” for a description of certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement._

The Issuer will not be required to, nor does the Issuer currently intend to, offer to exchange the Notes for
notes registered under the Securities Act or otherwise register or qualify by prospectus the Notes for resale under
the Securities Act. The Indenture will not be qualified under, or incorporate by reference or include, or be subject
to, any provisions of the Trust Indenture Act, including Section 316(b) thereof. Accordingly, the terms of the
Notes include only those stated in the Indenture, and the Holders will not be entitled to the protections provided
under the Trust Indenture Act to holders of debt securities issued under a qualified indenture, including among
other things, those requiring the Trustee to resign in the event of certain conflicts of interest and to inform
Holders of certain relationships between it and us.

Each Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s
obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code
or any comparable provision of foreign or state law to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and
other laws and be further limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles.

As of December 31, 2020, as adjusted to give effect to the Transaction, the Issuer and its consolidated
Subsidiaries would have had total as adjusted Indebtedness (including lease liabilities amount to €51.0 million) in
a nominal amount of €1,845.6 million, including €1,650 million (equivalent) of Indebtedness secured on the
Charged Property on a first-priority basis, consisting of €1,000 million (equivalent) of term loan drawings under
the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and €650 million (equivalent) under the Notes. The Senior
Secured Credit Facilities Agreement contains the €325 million Revolving Credit Facility of which approximately
€75 million has been utilized by way of ancillary facilities.

**Principal and Maturity**

On the Issue Date, the Issuer will issue €650 million (equivalent) in aggregate principal amount Notes,
consisting of €400 million of Euro Notes and €250 million (equivalent) in aggregate principal amount Dollar
Notes. The Notes will mature on, 2028. Each series of Euro Notes will be issued in minimum
denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Dollar Notes will be issued

189


-----

in minimum denominations of $200,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. For the avoidance
of doubt, DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream (as applicable, the “Relevant Clearing Systems” and each, a “Relevant
_Clearing System”) are not required to monitor or enforce the minimum amount. The rights of Holders of_
beneficial interests in the Notes to receive the payments on such Notes are subject to applicable procedures of the
Relevant Clearing Systems, as applicable. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a
Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to
payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any
further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

**Interest**

**_Euro Notes_**

Interest on the Euro Notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum and will be payable, in cash,
semi-annually in arrears on and of each year, commencing on . The Issuer will make
each interest payment for so long as the Euro Notes are global Notes to the Holders of record at the close of
business (in Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable) on the Clearing System Business Day immediately before
the due date for such payment, where “Clearing System Business Day” means a day on which the Relevant
Clearing System for which the global note representing the Euro Notes is being held is open for business, or to
the extent Definitive Registered Notes in respect of the Euro Notes have been issued, Holders of record at the
close of business on the and preceding the applicable interest payment date. Interest on the
Euro Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid,
from the date of original issuance. Interest on overdue principal and interest on the Euro Notes will accrue at a
rate that is 1% higher than the interest rate on the overdue principal or interest. Interest will be computed on the
basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. Each interest period will end on (but not include)
the relevant interest payment date. If the Issuer delivers global notes to the Trustee for cancellation on a date that
is on or after the record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid
interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date will be paid on the redemption date to the Holder in whose
name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date in accordance with the applicable
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will
be subject to redemption by the Issuer.

_Dollar Notes_

Interest on the Dollar Notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum and will be payable, in cash,
semi-annually in arrears on and of each year, commencing on, to Holders of record
on the and preceding the applicable interest payment date. Interest on the Dollar Notes will
accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the date of
original issuance. Interest on overdue principal and interest on the Dollar Notes will accrue at a rate that is 1%
higher than the interest rate on the overdue principal or interest. Interest will be computed on the basis of a
360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. Each interest period will end on (but not include) the relevant
interest payment date. If the Issuer delivers global notes to the Trustee for cancellation on a date that is on or
after the record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest up
to, but excluding, the redemption date will be paid on the redemption date to the Holder in whose name the
Note is registered at the close of business on such record date in accordance with the applicable procedures of
DTC, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the
Issuer.

_General_

Any Notes represented by global notes held by a nominee of the Relevant Clearing System will be subject
to the then applicable procedures of the Relevant Clearing System, as applicable. Euroclear’s and
Clearstream’s current practice is to make payments in respect of global notes to participants of record that hold
an interest in the relevant global notes on the business day immediately preceding the applicable interest payment
date.

**Additional Notes**

The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which €650 million (equivalent),
consisting of €400 million in aggregate principal amount Euro Notes and €250 million (equivalent) in aggregate

190


-----

“Additional Notes”) from time to time under the Indenture, subject to compliance with the covenants contained in
the Indenture. Any series of Additional Notes shall have terms substantially identical to the relevant series of
Notes, as applicable, originally issued, except in respect of any of the following terms which shall be set forth in
an Officer’s Certificate (defined below) or, at the election of the Issuer, a supplemental indenture, delivered to
the Trustee:

Additional Notes (which shall distinguish the Additional Notes of the series from Notes of any other series);

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Notes;

(3) the date or dates on which such Additional Notes will be issued and will mature;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Notes shall bear interest and, if
applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such interest rate or rates, the date
or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment dates on which such interest shall be
payable or the method by which such dates will be determined, the record dates for the determination of
holders thereof to whom such interest is payable and the basis upon which such interest will be calculated;

(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Notes shall be denominated and the currency in which
cash or government obligations in connection with such series of Additional Notes may be payable;

(6) the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which, and the terms and
conditions upon which, such Additional Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part;

(7) if other than in minimum denominations of (y) €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof,
in the case of Additional Notes in respect of Euro Notes and (z) $200,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in
excess thereof, in the case of Additional Notes in respect of Dollar Notes, the denominations in which such
Additional Notes shall be issued and redeemed;

(8) the ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification numbers with respect to such Additional
Notes; and

(9) any relevant limitation language with respect to Notes Guarantees and Transaction Security Documents.

Such Additional Notes will be treated, along with all other Notes, as a single class for the purposes of the
Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments and all other matters which are not specifically distinguished for
such series in such Officer’s Certificate or supplemental indenture (as applicable); provided that any Additional
Notes that are not fungible with the applicable series of Notes offered hereunder for U.S. federal income tax
purposes shall have a separate ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number from such
Notes. Unless the context otherwise requires, for all purposes of the Indenture and this “Description of the
Notes,” references to “Notes” shall be deemed to include references to the Notes initially issued on the Issue
Date as well as any Additional Notes.

**Payments**

Principal of, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts (as defined below), if any, with respect to
the Euro Notes represented by one or more global notes held by a common depositary of Euroclear and
Clearstream and registered in the name of its nominee will be made through the Principal Paying Agent (as

_provided that all payments of principal of, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, with respect_
to certificated Euro Notes may, at the option of the Issuer, be made by wire transfer to a euro account maintained
by the payee with a bank in the United States, the United Kingdom or Europe if the applicable Holder elects
payment by wire transfer by giving written notice to the Trustee and the Principal Paying Agent to such effect
designating such account no later than 30 days immediately preceding the relevant due date for payment (or such
other date as the Principal Paying Agent may accept in its discretion).

The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on such Notes are subject to applicable procedures
of the Relevant Clearing System. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day at
the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the
amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest
or other payment as a result of any such delay.

**Paying Agents, Registrars and Transfer Agents for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain a Paying Agent for the Euro Notes and the initial Principal Paying Agent will be
Elavon Financial Services DAC. The Issuer will also maintain a Paying Agent for the Dollar Notes and the initial
Dollar Paying Agent will be U.S. Bank National Association.

The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the “Euro Registrar”) and a transfer agent (the “Euro Transfer
_Agent”) for the Notes. The initial Euro Registrar and the initial Euro Transfer Agent will be Elavon Financial_
Services DAC. The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the “Dollar Registrar” and, together with the Euro
Registrar, the “Registrars”) and a transfer agent (the “Dollar Transfer Agent” and, together with the Euro
Transfer Agent, the “Transfer Agents”) for the Dollar Notes. The initial Dollar Registrar and the initial Dollar
Transfer Agent will be U.S. Bank National Association. The respective Registrars will each maintain a register
reflecting ownership of the relevant Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and together with the respective
Transfer Agents will facilitate transfers of the relevant Notes on behalf of the Issuer.

Upon written notice to the Trustee, the Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent
for the Notes without prior notice to the Holders of such Notes. For so long as Notes are listed on the Official
List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”) and if and to the extent that the rules of The
International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”) so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority
of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as
Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the Notes provided that it segregates and holds in a separate trust fund for
the benefit of the Holders all money held by it as paying agent.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The applicable Registrar and
the Trustee may require a Holder to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents in connection with
a transfer of Notes. Holders will be required to pay all taxes due on transfer. Any such transfer or exchange will
be made without charge to Holders, other than any taxes payable in connection with such transfer. The Issuer and
any Transfer Agent will not be required to transfer or exchange any Note selected for redemption or tendered
(and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer
(each as defined herein). None of the Issuer, the Transfer Agents or the Registrars will be required to transfer or
exchange any Note for a period of 15 days before the delivery of a notice of redemption of Notes to be redeemed
or between record date and payment date. The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the absolute owner
of the Note for all purposes. See “Book Entry, Delivery and Form.”

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

As of the Issue Date, each Subsidiary of the Issuer will be a “Restricted Subsidiary” for the purposes of the
Indenture. However, in the circumstances described below under “—Certain Covenants—Designation of

192


-----

_Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries,” the Issuer will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as_
Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the
Indenture and will not guarantee, or provide security with respect to, the Notes.

**Note Guarantees**

**_General_**

On the Issue Date, the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture will be, jointly and
severally, unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis (the “Note Guarantees”) by Spa US Holdco, Inc. (“U.S.
_Holdco” and the “Initial Guarantor”). Subject to and in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles and to_
certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, within 120 days from the Business Day immediately
after the Squeeze-Out Completion Date (if any), the Notes are expected to be guaranteed on a senior basis by
either (a) the Company, Ahlstrom-Munksjö Tampere Oy, Ahlstrom-Munksjö Industries S.A.S, AhlstromMunksjö France Holding S.A.S, Ahlstrom-Munksjö La Gère S.A.S, Ahlstrom-Munksjö Specialties S.A.S,
Ahlstrom-Munksjö Arches S.A.S, Ahlstrom-Munksjö Brignoud S.A.S, Ahlstrom-Munksjö Italia S.p.A.,
Ahlstrom-Munksjo USA Inc., Ahlstrom-Munksjo Nonwovens LLC, Ahlstrom-Munksjo Filtration LLC,
Ahlstrom-Munksjo NA Specialty Solutions Holdings Inc., Ahlstrom-Munksjo NA Specialty Solutions LLC and
Ahlstrom-Munksjo Mosinee LLC or (b) such other combination of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer that
guarantee the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement within 120 days from the Business Day immediately
after the Squeeze-Out Completion Date (the “Post Squeeze-Out Guarantors”). The Senior Secured Credit
Facilities will be guaranteed on a senior basis by each Post Squeeze-Out Guarantor. In addition, if required by the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted
_Subsidiaries” and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, certain other_
Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Note Guarantee in the future and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement.
As of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Post Squeeze-Out Guarantors accounted for 53% of our
consolidated assets, 48% of our consolidated net sales and 70% of our consolidated EBITDA.

By its terms, the obligations of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum
amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent
conveyance provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law to
comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws and the Note Guarantees of, or the relevant
Note Documents to be entered into by, certain Guarantors organized in certain jurisdictions, including, without
limitation, Finland, France and Italy, will contain language limiting the amount of indebtedness guaranteed or
qualifying the Note Guarantee in order to address applicable local law considerations (including preservation of
share capital and statutory reserves, capitalization, prohibited financial assistance, corporate benefit principles
and other legal restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and their respective shareholders and directors). In
addition, the Note Guarantees will be further limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles as
described below under “—Security—General.” The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of
guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and the
Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other
things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial
assistance rules, corporate benefit rules, fraudulent preference rules, “thin capitalization” rules, capital
maintenance rules, retention of title claims and similar matters, or where the time and cost of granting the
guarantee would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders. By virtue of these limitations, a
Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to
the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee. However, such
limitations may not be effective under local law. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our
_Structure—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Note_
_Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and_
_the Collateral” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure—The insolvency laws of_
_Finland and other applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable to you as the insolvency laws of the United_
_States or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other limitations on the Note Guarantees and_
_the Security Interests (as defined herein), including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may adversely affect their_
_validity and enforceability.” The validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the liability of each_
Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described in “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations
_on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

193


-----

The Issuer is a holding company and its only material assets are its interests in the capital stock of its
Subsidiaries. As such, the Issuer will be dependent upon the Restricted Subsidiaries to make payments to them to
service interest, principal and other payments on the Notes.

A significant portion of the operations of the Issuer will be conducted through Subsidiaries that are not
expected to become Guarantors, including Subsidiaries exempt from becoming Guarantors or having security
granted over their shares or assets under the Agreed Security Principles. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantors,
including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those
Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries and claims against
joint ventures generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries and joint
ventures over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including Holders. The Notes and each
Note Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred
and minority stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than the Guarantors) and joint ventures.
Although the Indenture limits the incurrence of Indebtedness (including Disqualified Stock, and Preferred Stock
of Restricted Subsidiaries), the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the
Indenture does not impose any limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not
considered Indebtedness under the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

**_Note Guarantee Releases_**

The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon:

(1) a direct or indirect sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (including by way of merger, amalgamation,
consolidation, dividend distribution or otherwise) of (i) the Capital Stock of such Guarantor (as a result of
which such Guarantor would no longer be a Restricted Subsidiary), or (ii) all or substantially all the assets
of the Guarantor, to a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary and otherwise in compliance
with the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(2) the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(3) payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or legal defeasance, covenant
defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes and the Indenture, as provided in “—Defeasance” and
“—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(4) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
including in respect of the provisions relating to an IPO Debt Pushdown;

(5) upon the release or discharge of the Guarantee and any other obligations of such Guarantor under the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, provided that such Guarantor is not providing a Guarantee in respect
of any other Credit Facility that replaces the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement at such time that
will not also be released substantially simultaneously with the release of the Notes Guarantee and/or a
Guarantee under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement;

(6) as described in the second paragraph of the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries”;_

(7) upon the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of any Guarantor with and into the Issuer or another
Guarantor or upon the liquidation of such Guarantor, in each case, in compliance with the covenant under
“—Merger and Consolidation”;

(8) in connection with a Permitted Transaction;

(9) upon the achievement of Investment Grade Status by the Notes; and

(10) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers.”

The Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, shall, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement
and subject to receipt of certain documentation requested pursuant to the Indenture, take all necessary actions at
the reasonable request and cost of the Issuer, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Note Guarantee in
accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set
forth above shall be effected by the Trustee without the consent of the Holders and will not require any other
action or consent on the part of the Trustee. None of the Issuer, the Trustee or any Guarantor will be required to
make a notation on the Notes to reflect any such release, termination or discharge. The Issuer may in its sole
discretion, and without prejudice to any future election in relation thereto, elect to have any Note Guarantee
remain in place, as opposed to being released.

194


-----

**Security**

**_General_**

On the Issue Date, the Notes and the Note Guarantees in respect thereof will be secured on a first-priority
basis by (collectively, the “Issue Date Collateral”):

   - a Finnish law-governed security agreement in respect of (i) the shares held by Topco in the Issuer,
(ii) any structural intercompany receivables owed to Topco by the Issuer, (iii) any structural
intercompany receivables owed to U.S. Holdco by the Issuer and (iv) the material bank accounts of the
Issuer located in Finland (without control over use and freely operational prior to a declared default);

   - a New York law-governed share pledge over the Issuer’s shares in the capital of U.S. Holdco;

   - a New York law-governed (i) general security agreement pledging substantially all of U.S. Holdco’s
assets (subject to customary exclusions consistent with the Agreed Security Principles) and (ii) share
pledge in respect of any shares U.S. Holdco owns in any Material Subsidiary (as defined in the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities Agreement) owned or incorporated in the United States; and

   - a Finnish law-governed book-entry account pledge agreement in respect of the book-entries relating to
the Company Shares owned by the Issuer.

In addition, within 120 days from the Business Day immediately after the Squeeze-Out Completion Date,
subject to the Agreed Security Principles and to certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, the
Notes and the Note Guarantees in respect thereof will be secured by (collectively, the “Post Squeeze-Out
_Collateral” and, together with the Issue Date Collateral, the “Collateral”):_

   - the shares held in each Post Squeeze-Out Guarantor; and

   - in respect of a Post Squeeze-Out Guarantor incorporated in the United States or Finland (or, to the
extent applicable, another Guarantor Jurisdiction), floating security over substantially all assets located
in its jurisdiction of incorporation (subject to customary “excluded assets,” including real estate, and
other customary exclusions, materiality thresholds and exceptions),

in each case, where to do so would not have a material adverse effect on their ability to conduct their
business and operations, as determined by each such Post Squeeze-Out Guarantor in its sole and absolute
discretion. The Collateral and any other assets subject to Security Interests that may in the future be granted to
secure obligations under the Notes, any Note Guarantees and the Indenture in accordance with the provisions of
the Intercreditor Agreement constitute “Charged Property.”

The Charged Property will also secure the Senior Secured Credit Facilities on a pari passu basis and may
also secure certain Hedging Obligations, any Additional Notes and certain other future Indebtedness. In addition,
under certain circumstances, including a repayment in full of the amounts outstanding under Facility B, any
Revolving Facility (including the Original Revolving Facility) Incurred pursuant to sub-clause (i)(A)(3) of the
second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” below,
may be re-designated as a “super senior” obligation under the Intercreditor Agreement, and following such
re-designation, Holders will only receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Charged Property after the
obligations thereunder (and certain super senior Hedging Obligations) have been paid in full. See “Description of
_Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement” and “—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens.”_

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the Issuer and_
the Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to grant security over the Charged Property in connection with
future issuances of Indebtedness or Indebtedness of the Restricted Subsidiaries, including, subject to certain
requirements described herein, Additional Notes, as permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement.

The Charged Property will be granted to the Security Agent on behalf of the Holders and holders of the
other secured obligations that are secured by the Charged Property pursuant to the Transaction Security
Documents. All Charged Property will be subject to the limitations that are applicable to Note Guarantees
granted by the same entity, the operation of the Agreed Security Principles and any Permitted Collateral Liens.

The proceeds from the enforcement of the Charged Property may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations
owed to the Holders. No appraisals of the Charged Property have been made in connection with the offering of
the Notes. By its nature, some or all of the Charged Property will be illiquid and may have no readily

195


-----

ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Charged Property may not be able to be sold in a short period of
time, or at all. The proceeds from the enforcement of the Charged Property may not be sufficient to satisfy the
obligations owed to the Holders. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure—The Notes
_will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that will be granted as security for the Notes,_
_future secured indebtedness may be secured by certain assets that do not secure the Notes and it may be difficult_
_to realize the value of the Collateral and the Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances.”_

The Liens on the Charged Property will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising
under or imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Charged Property (including
those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose
or benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally)
or other considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations, see “Certain Insolvency
_Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security_
_Interests.”_

Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of the covenant described below under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” certain property, rights and assets may not be pledged, and any pledge over_
property, rights and assets may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), and certain guarantees may not be granted
in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles. The following is a non-exhaustive summary of certain terms
of the Agreed Security Principles, which include, among others:

   - general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance, anti-trust and other
competition authority restrictions, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, equitable subordination,
“transfer pricing”, “thin capitalization”, “earnings stripping”, “controlled foreign corporation” and
other tax restrictions, “exchange control restrictions”, “capital maintenance” rules and “liquidity
impairment” rules, tax restrictions, retention of title claims, employee consultation or approval
requirements and similar principles may limit the ability of a member of the Group to provide a
guarantee or security or may require that the guarantee or security be limited as to amount or otherwise
and, if so, the guarantee or security will be limited accordingly; provided that, to the extent requested
by the Security Agent before signing any applicable security or accession document, the relevant
member of the Group shall use reasonable endeavors (but without incurring material cost and without
adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such
guarantee or security document shall be subject to such limit;

   - a key factor in determining whether or not (and the terms on which) a guarantee or security will be
taken (and in respect of the security, the extent of its perfection and/or registration) is the applicable
time and cost (including adverse effects on taxes, interest deductibility, stamp duty, registration costs
and taxes, notarial costs, translation costs and all applicable legal and notarial fees and adverse effects
on the ability of the Group to obtain or maintain local facilities or other financing arrangements,
including any factoring or similar arrangement in each case permitted under the Indenture) which will
not be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the secured parties of obtaining such guarantee or
security;

   - members of the Group will not be required to give guarantees or enter into security documents if they
are not wholly owned by another member of the Group or if it is not within the legal capacity of the
relevant members of the Group or if it would conflict with the fiduciary or statutory duties of their
officers or contravene any applicable legal, regulatory or contractual prohibition or restriction or have
the potential to result in a material risk of personal or criminal liability for any officer of or for any
member of the Group; provided that, to the extent requested by the Security Agent before signing any
applicable security document or accession document, the relevant member of the Group shall use
reasonable endeavors (but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships
with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or security document
shall be subject to such limit;

   - guarantees and security will be limited so that the aggregate of notarial costs and all registration and
like taxes and duties relating to the provision of security will not exceed an amount to be agreed
between the Issuer and the Security Agent;

   - where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of granting

being subject to the applicable security document (including requiring a consent of any third party,
supervisory board or works council (or equivalent)) and any asset which, if subject to the applicable
security document, would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights,

respect to the Notes if prevented by the terms of the documentation governing that acquired

Acquired Indebtedness) or if becoming a Guarantor or the granting of any security would give rise to

Issuer.

**_Priority_**

The relative contractual priority with regard to the security interests in the Charged Property that are created
by the Transaction Security Documents (the “Security Interests” and each, a “Security Interest”) as between
(a) the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, (b) the counterparties under certain
Hedging Obligations, (c) the Trustee, the Security Agent and the Holders under the Indenture and (d) the
creditors of certain other Indebtedness (including Indebtedness that may be Incurred in the future) permitted to be
secured by such Charged Property, respectively, will be established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement,
which will provide, among other things, that the obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement, the Notes and certain Hedging Obligations and the guarantees thereof are secured equally and ratably
by first-priority Security Interests in the Charged Property. In addition, any Revolving Facility (including the
Original Revolving Facility) Incurred pursuant to sub-clause (i)(A)(3) of the second paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” below, may be re-designated as a “super
senior” obligation under the Intercreditor Agreement, and following such re-designation, Holders will only
receive proceeds from the enforcement of, or certain distressed disposals of, the Charged Property after the
obligations thereunder (and certain super senior Hedging Obligations) have been paid in full. See “Description of
_Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement” and “—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens.”_

**_Transaction Security Documents_**

Under the Transaction Security Documents, the Issuer and the Guarantors will grant security over the
Charged Property to secure the payment when due of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ payment obligations under
the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Indenture. The Transaction Security Documents will be entered into by
the relevant security provider and the Security Agent for itself and as agent and, in respect of the Transaction
Security Documents governed by Italian law, as Security Representative and legal representative (mandatario
_con rappresentanza), for the secured parties. When entering into such Transaction Security Documents, the_
Security Agent will act in its own name, but for the benefit of the secured parties (including itself, the Trustee
and the Holders from time to time). Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent also acts as an agent
of the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and the counterparties under certain Hedging
Obligations in relation to the Security Interests created in favor of such parties.

198


-----

In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws governing the creation and perfection of Security Interests and local
court decisions, the relevant Transaction Security Documents (other than for the Transaction Security Documents
governed by Italian law) will secure “parallel debt” obligations created under the Intercreditor Agreement in
favor of the Security Agent (and not the obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees). The parallel debt
construct has not been fully tested under the law in certain of these jurisdictions. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Notes and Our Structure—The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security_
_Agent, rather than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Trustee or the Security Agent, as_
_applicable, to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by local law.”_

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
only the Security Agent will have the right to enforce the Transaction Security Documents on behalf of the
Trustee and the Holders. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, Holders will not be entitled to take
enforcement action in respect of the Charged Property securing the Notes, except through the Trustee under the
Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent.

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Transaction Security Documents and
the Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes and the Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by Security Interests in
the Charged Property until all obligations under the Notes and the Indenture have been discharged. However, the
Security Interests with respect to the Notes and the Indenture may be released under certain circumstances as
provided under “—Security—Release of Liens.”

In the event that the Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the
Security Interests created under the Transaction Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in
the Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the
Security Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement was successful, the Holders may not be able to
recover any amounts under the Transaction Security Documents. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes
_and Our Structure—The granting of the Note Guarantees and security interests in connection with the issuance_
_of the Notes, or the incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening or voidance_
_periods for such security interests in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions.”_

**_Enforcement of Security Interest_**

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will restrict the ability of the Holders or the Trustee to
enforce the Security Interests and provide for the release of the Security Interests created by the Transaction
Security Documents in certain circumstances upon enforcement by the Security Agent in accordance with the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. These limitations are described under “Description of Other
_Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the_
_Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests.” The ability to enforce may also be_
restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness that is secured on the Charged Property in
compliance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The creditors under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the counterparties to Hedging
Obligations secured by the Charged Property and the Trustee have and, by accepting a Note as described below,
each Holder will be deemed to have appointed the Security Agent, also for the purposes of Article 1704
(mandato con rappresentanza) of the Italian Civil Code, to act as its agent and mandatario con rappresentanza
under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents securing such Indebtedness. Furthermore, in
respect of Transaction Security Documents governed by Italian law, each Holder shall be deemed to have
appointed the Security Agent as mandatario con rappresentanza pursuant to article 1704 of the Italian Civil
Code and as representative (rappresentante) pursuant to article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code to
act in its name and on its behalf.

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_**

The Indenture will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, will be deemed (without any further
consent of the Holders) to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Transaction Security Documents
and perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under
the Intercreditor Agreement and the Transaction Security Documents securing such Indebtedness, together
with any other incidental rights, power and discretions;

199


-----

(2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements and the Transaction Security Documents;

(3) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act in its name and on its behalf to enter into
and comply with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements
and the Transaction Security Documents (including the execution of, and compliance with, any waiver,
modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Trustee or the Security
Agent on its behalf) and to be bound thereby and to perform their respective obligations and exercise their
respective rights thereunder in accordance therewith; and

(4) agreed to, and accepted, the appointment of GLAS Trust Corporation Limited, as representative
(rappresentante) of the Holders for the purposes of Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code
in relation to the Transaction Security Documents governed by Italian law.

See the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure—The security interests
_in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent, rather than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability_
_of the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable, to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by local law.”_

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as
defined below) entered into in compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional
_Intercreditor Agreements.”_

**_Release of Liens_**

Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, release of
the Security Interests in respect of the Charged Property will be permitted under any one or more of the
following circumstances:

(1) other than the Liens over the Capital Stock of the Issuer, in connection with any sale or other disposition of
Charged Property to (a) a Person that is not the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any
transaction subject to “—Merger and Consolidation”), if such sale or other disposition does not violate the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” and is
otherwise not prohibited by the Indenture or (b) any Restricted Subsidiary; provided that this sub-clause
(b) shall not be relied upon in the case of a transfer of Capital Stock or of accounts receivable (including
intercompany loan receivables and hedging receivables) to a Restricted Subsidiary (except to a
Securitization Subsidiary) unless the relevant property and assets remain subject to, or otherwise become
subject to, a Lien in favor of the Notes following such sale or disposal;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Note Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the
release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

(3) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or legal defeasance,
covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and
“—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(5) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such
Unrestricted Subsidiary, and the release of any assets designated by the Issuer as Receivables Assets in
connection with a Receivables Facility;

(6) in connection with the granting of Liens on such property or assets, which may include Charged Property, or
the sale or transfer of such property or assets, which may include Charged Property, in each case pursuant to
a Qualified Securitization Financing;

(7) in connection with a Permitted Transaction; or

(8) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture.

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Transaction Security Documents will be released (a) in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, including in respect of
the provisions relating to an IPO Debt Pushdown and (b) as may be permitted by the covenant described under
“—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest.”

200


-----

The Security Agent and the Trustee (but only if required) will take all necessary action reasonably requested
by, and at the cost of, the Issuer to effectuate any release of Charged Property securing the Notes and the Note
Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Transaction Security Document. Each of the releases set forth above
shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee
(unless action is required by it to effect such release). The Security Agent and the Trustee shall be entitled to
request and rely solely upon an Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel, each certifying which
circumstance, as described above, giving rise to a release of the Security Interests has occurred, and that such
release complies with the Indenture.

**IPO Debt Pushdown**

On or following certain public equity offerings (an “IPO Event”) (or in contemplation of an IPO Event with
respect to the release of Security Interests if required to implement such IPO Event), the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement provide (and the Indenture and the Notes shall be subject to such provisions) that the
Issuer shall be entitled to require (by written notice to the Trustee and the Security Agent) that the terms of the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and the Transaction
Security Documents shall operate (with effect from the date specified in such notice) as described under
“Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement—Required Consents—Provisions Following an
_IPO” (an “IPO Debt Pushdown”). Following such notice, among other things, the Group would comprise of the_
member of the Group or holding company of the Issuer who will issue shares or whose shares are to be sold
pursuant to such IPO Event, subject to certain limitations while the Notes are outstanding or in certain other
circumstances (the “IPO Pushdown Entity”) and its restricted subsidiaries and the Indenture will include
provisions to provide for substitution of the IPO Pushdown Entity as issuer to the extent permitted in accordance
with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Any Parent Holding Company of the IPO Pushdown Entity
would not be subject to the provisions of the Indenture and the other Notes Documents and any security over its
assets may be released or if a Guarantor, its Notes Guarantee may be released, in each case, in accordance with
the provisions of the Indenture. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall be required to enter into any
amendment to the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or the
Transaction Security Documents (in the case of the Security Agent) required by the Issuer, enter into any
document or instrument in connection therewith and/or take such other action as is required by the Issuer in order
to facilitate or reflect any of the matters contemplated by the Intercreditor Agreement; provided that, and
notwithstanding any contrary provision in the Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the Trustee, such
amendment, replacement or other document or instrument does not impose personal obligations on the Trustee or
the Security Agent, or affect the rights, duties, liabilities, indemnification or immunity of the Trustee or the
Security Agent under such amendment, release or replacement or other document or instrument.

**Optional Redemption**

are not redeemable at the option of the Issuer.

_Other Redemptions Terms_

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for any series of Notes, including a
Change of Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding Notes of such series validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender
offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes
validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not
less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase date, to
redeem all Notes of such series, in whole or in part, that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price
equal to the price offered to each other Holder (excluding any early tender or incentive fee) in such tender offer
plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts,
if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the date of such redemption. Without prejudice to any provision of the
Indenture regarding Notes deemed not be outstanding for voting purposes if held by the Issuer or its Affiliates, in
determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes
of a series have validly tendered and not validly withdrawn Notes in a tender offer, including a Change of
Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, Notes owned by an Affiliate of the Issuer or by funds controlled or
managed by any Affiliate of the Issuer, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the
purposes of such tender offer and such determination.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice” below.

Notice of any redemption of the Notes may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be given prior to the completion of a
transaction (including an Equity Offering, an incurrence of Indebtedness, a Change of Control, an Asset
Disposition or other transaction) and any redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more
conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of a related transaction. If such redemption or
purchase is so subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall describe each such
condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption or repurchase date may be
delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption or offer to purchase
was sent) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the Issuer in its sole discretion), or such
redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such
conditions shall not have been satisfied (or waived by the Issuer in its sole discretion) by the redemption or
purchase date, or by the redemption or purchase date as so delayed, or that such notice may be rescinded at any
time in the Issuer’s sole discretion if the Issuer determines that any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied
or waived. In addition, the Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption or purchase price
and performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another
Person.

The Issuer may redeem Notes pursuant to one or more of the relevant provisions in the Indenture, and a
single notice of redemption may be delivered with respect to redemptions made pursuant to different provisions.
Any such notice may provide that redemptions made pursuant to different provisions will have the same or
different redemption dates.

If the optional redemption date is on or after a record date and on or before the corresponding interest
payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date will be paid on the
redemption date to the Holder in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date
in accordance with the applicable procedures of the Relevant Clearing System, and no additional interest will be
payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer.

Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes
or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

**Mandatory Redemption or Sinking Fund**

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect
to the Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase Notes as

203


-----

described under “—Change of Control” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitations on Sales of Assets and
_Subsidiary Stock.” As market conditions warrant, we and our equity holders, including the Permitted Holders,_
their respective Affiliates and members of our management, may from time to time seek to purchase our
outstanding debt securities or loans, including the Notes or derivative instruments related thereto, in privately
negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Subject to any applicable limitations
contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness, including the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement
and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any purchases made by us may be funded by the use of cash on our
balance sheet or the incurrence of new secured or unsecured debt, including borrowings under our credit
facilities. The amounts involved in any such purchase transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be
material. Any such purchases may be with respect to a substantial amount of a particular class or series of debt,
with the attendant reduction in the trading liquidity of such class or series.

**Selection and Notice**

In the event that any global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, the Relevant Clearing System, as
applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such global Note from the amount
received by them in respect of the redemption of such global Note. The redemption price payable in connection
with the redemption of such Book Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by the Relevant Clearing
System, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such global Note (or any portion thereof).

Under the existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Euro Notes are to be
redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a pro rata
basis (such as by way of a pool factor), by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate and in
accordance with their applicable procedures (unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange
rules); provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000 principal amount may be redeemed
in part. If the Euro Notes are not held through Euroclear or Clearstream, the Euro Notes will be selected on a pro
_rata basis, subject to adjustments so that no Euro Note in an unauthorized denomination remains outstanding_
after such redemption; provided, however, no such partial redemption shall reduce the outstanding principal
amount of any Euro Notes below €100,000. The Trustee, the Paying Agents and the Registrars shall not be liable
for selections made under this paragraph.

Under the existing practices of DTC, if fewer than all of the Dollar Notes are to be redeemed at any time,
DTC will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a pro rata pass-through distribution of principal basis
and in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC (unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock
exchange rules); provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than $200,000 principal amount with
respect to Dollar Notes may be redeemed in part. If the Dollar Notes are not held through DTC, the Dollar Notes
will be selected on a pro rata basis, subject to adjustments so that no Dollar Note in an unauthorized
denomination remains outstanding after such redemption; provided, however, no such partial redemption shall
reduce the outstanding principal amount of any Dollar Notes below $200,000. The Trustee, the Paying Agents
and the Registrars shall not be liable for selections made under this paragraph.

Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at least
10 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at the
address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable
procedures of the Relevant Clearing Systems, except that redemption notices may be delivered electronically or
mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a legal or covenant
defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture.

If and for so long as any Notes are listed on the Exchange and if and to the extent the rules of the Authority
so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any such notice to the Holders of the Notes and, in connection
with any redemption, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any change in the principal amount of Notes
outstanding.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the
portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, and, in the case of the Dollar Notes, the beginning and
ending pool factor. When the Notes are held in certificated form, a new Note in principal amount equal to the
unredeemed portion of the original Note will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the
original Note. When the Notes are held in the form of global notes, an appropriate notation will be made on such
Note (or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of the Relevant Clearing Systems) to decrease
the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the
applicable redemption notice (including any conditions contained therein), Notes called for redemption become

204


-----

due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, unless the Issuer defaults in the payment
of the redemption price, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption.

Except as otherwise required under the Indenture, the Issuer may elect to redeem or repurchase one or more
series of Notes or a portion of a series of Notes without redeeming any other series of Notes.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer may redeem the Euro Notes or the Dollar Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time at its
discretion upon giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice to the Holders (which notice
will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to
the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment
date) and all Additional Amounts, as defined below under “—Withholding Taxes,” if any, then due and which
will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if the Issuer determines
in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations, official guidance or rulings
promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below under “—Withholding
Taxes”) affecting taxation; or

(2) any amendment to, or change in an official application, administration or written interpretation of such
laws, treaties, regulations, official guidance or rulings (including by reason of a holding, judgment or
order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) (each of the
foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

a Payor (as defined below under “—Withholding Taxes”) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect
of the applicable series of Notes would be, required to pay Additional Amounts (or increased Additional
Amounts) with respect to the applicable series of Notes (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment
giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or another Guarantor who can make such payment
without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable
measures available to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent
where this would be reasonable). Such Change in Tax Law must be formally announced and become effective on
or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
on a date after the Issue Date, such later date). The foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after
such time as such Guarantor is obliged to make at least one payment on the Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to
any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture, with respect to a Change in
Tax Law occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described
under “Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given earlier
than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of
Additional Amounts. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of Notes pursuant to the
foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such
redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right to so redeem
have been satisfied and that the obligation to pay Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the relevant Payor
taking reasonable measures available to it (but in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such
requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or another Guarantor who can make such payment without the
obligation to pay Additional Amounts) and (b) a written opinion of independent tax counsel of recognized
standing qualified under the laws of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and satisfactory to the Trustee (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld) to the effect that the Payor has been or will become obligated to pay
Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely
conclusively on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions
precedent described above, without liability or further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding
on the Holders.

205


-----

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of any Issuer or any Guarantor (including any successor entity) (each, a
“Payor”) in respect of the Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee, as applicable, will be made free and clear
of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of
such Taxes is then required by law or by the relevant taxing authority’s interpretation or administration thereof. If
any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or Note Guarantee is made by or on
behalf of any Payor or the Paying Agent or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof
or therein having the power to tax (including the jurisdiction of the Paying Agent); or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax
purposes, or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or
governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2), a
“Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of any Payor or the
Paying Agent with respect to any Note or any Note Guarantee, including (without limitation) payments of
principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, such Payor will pay (together with such payments) such
additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in
respect of such payments, after such withholding or deduction (including any such withholding or deduction
from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been received in respect of
such payments on any such Note or Note Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided,
_however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:_

(1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any
present or former connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary,
member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant
Holder is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or resident
or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in or place of
management present in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding,
in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Note or
the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Note, the Indenture or a
Note Guarantee;

(2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or
the beneficial owner of the Note to comply with a reasonable written request of the Payor addressed to
the Holder or beneficial owner, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any such withholding or
deduction would be payable), to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence
concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any
declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is
required by a law, statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, all or part of such Tax,
but, in each case, only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to do so;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed as a result of the presentation of the Note for payment
(where Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and presentation is required) more than 30
days after the later of the applicable payment date or the date the relevant payment is first made
available for payment to the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to
Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period);

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment with respect to
the Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, capital gains, excise taxes imposed on transfer or any Note,
personal property or similar Taxes;

(6) any Taxes imposed, deducted or withheld pursuant to section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) or otherwise imposed pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474
of the Code, in each case, as of the Issue Date (and any amended or successor version that is

206


-----

substantively comparable), any current or future regulations or agreements thereunder, official
interpretations thereof or similar law or regulation implementing an intergovernmental agreement
relating thereto;

(7) any U.S. federal back-up withholding tax under section 3406 of the Code;

(8) any U.S. federal withholding taxes imposed, deducted or withheld by reason of the Holder of the Dollar
Notes (or the beneficial owner for whose benefit such Holder holds such Dollar Notes, or a fiduciary,
settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of such Holder if such Holder is an estate, trust,
partnership, or corporation, or a person holding a power over an estate or trust administered by a
fiduciary Holder of such Notes) being or having been a “10-percent shareholder” of the Issuer as
defined in section 871(h)(3) of the Code or any successor provision;

(9) any U.S. federal withholding taxes that would not have been imposed or withheld but for the beneficial
owner being a bank purchasing the Dollar Notes in the ordinary course of its lending business within
the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code or any successor provision;

(10) any U.S. federal withholding taxes that would not have been imposed or withheld but for the beneficial
owner being or having been a foreign or domestic personal holding company, a passive foreign
investment company or a controlled foreign corporation with respect to the United States, or a
corporation that has accumulated earnings to avoid United States federal income tax; or

(11) any combination of the items (1) through (10) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership
or any Person other than the beneficial owner of the Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settler with
respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to
Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner held such Notes directly.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the relevant tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will provide certified copies
of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of such other
reasonable evidence as is available of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee (with a
copy to the Paying Agent). Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will
be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment made on any Note or any
Note Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the
Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount
estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional
Amounts on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45
days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as
promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments
are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” there is mentioned,
in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of the Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Note Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such
context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay and reimburse each applicable Holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration,
court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect
thereto) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest
or penalties with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, issuance,
delivery, registration, enforcement of, or receipt of payments with respect to any Notes, any Note Guarantee, the

207


-----

Indenture, or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (in each case, other than in connection with a
transfer after this offering) and limited, solely to the extent of such taxes or similar charges or levies that arise
from the receipt of any payments of principal or interest on the Notes, to any such taxes or similar charges or
levies that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (3) and (5) through (10) (save that in respect of clause (5),
this proviso shall not apply in connection with transfer, personal property or similar Taxes).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any
transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any
successor to a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for
tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to the Notes (or any
Note Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such successor Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing authority
or agency thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, unless (i) a third party
makes a Change of Control Offer or (ii) the Issuer has previously or substantially concurrently therewith
delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described in the seventh paragraph
under this heading “—Change of Control,” the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes (provided
that Euro Notes of €100,000 or less in principal amount, and Dollar Notes of $200,000 or less in principal
amount, may only be redeemed in whole and not in part) pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of
_Control Offer”) at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and_
unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the date of repurchase; provided that if the
repurchase date is on or after the record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment date, then
Holders in whose name the Notes are registered at the close of business on such record date will receive interest
on the repurchase date. Within 60 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer will deliver
or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable
procedures of the Relevant Clearing Systems or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of
Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the
applicable procedures of the Relevant Clearing Systems, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute
the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on
the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days from the date
such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice,
except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering
Event as described below.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities
laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by
virtue thereof. The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC
will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Indenture does not
contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event
of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control would entitle each lender under the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement (individually) to cancel its commitments and require prepayment of
amounts outstanding to it under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and could trigger a change of
control under other financing arrangements of the Group. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries may
contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a change of control or require such Indebtedness to
be repurchased upon a change of control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the
Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control
Triggering Event itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. There can be no
assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases.

The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control
Triggering Event may be limited by its then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be
available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase
feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and,
thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature is a
result of negotiations between the Initial Purchasers and us. The Issuer has no present intention to engage in a

208


-----

transaction involving a Change of Control Triggering Event after the Issue Date, although it is possible that the
Issuer could decide to do so in the future.

Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions,
including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control
Triggering Event under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such
time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional
Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”
and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the
consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations
contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford
Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control
Triggering Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise
in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by
the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or
(ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described under
“—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the
applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent
contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a
Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditional upon
such Change of Control Triggering Event.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of
case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under
applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a
particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control Triggering Event
has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as
described above.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the written consent of
the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent that the
rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any Change of Control Offer.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that will be contained in the Indenture. For the
avoidance of doubt, the consummation of the Transaction shall not be prohibited by the covenants below under
“—Certain Covenants.”

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

Following the first day:

(a) a series of Notes has achieved Investment Grade Status; and

(b) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture,

(the occurrence of such events, a “Covenant Suspension Event” and the date thereof being referred to as the
“Suspension Date”), then, beginning on the Suspension Date until the occurrence of the Reversion Date (as
defined below), (i) the amount of each basket set by reference to a monetary amount for which a specific amount
is set out in the Indenture and any definitions used therein (including all “annual,” “life of facilities”, “fiscal
year”, “financial year”, “calendar year”, “at any time” and “aggregate” baskets) shall be increased by 50% and
(ii) the covenants specifically listed under the following captions in this Offering Memorandum will no longer be
applicable to the Notes (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”):

   - “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

   - “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

209


-----

   - “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”;

   - “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

   - the provisions of clause (iv) under “—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer”;

   - “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

   - “—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries”; and

   - “—Impairment of Security Interest.”

During any period that the foregoing covenants have been suspended, the Issuer may not designate any of its
Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. If and while the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to
the Suspended Covenants, the Notes will be entitled to substantially less covenant protection. In the event that
the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture for any
period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”) the Notes no
longer have an Investment Grade Rating or a Rating Agency withdraws its Investment Grade Rating or
downgrades the rating assigned to the relevant series of Notes below an Investment Grade Rating (in each case,
to the extent given an Investment Grade Rating by such Rating Agency), then the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture with respect to
future events. The period of time between the Suspension Date and the Reversion Date is referred to in this
description as the “Suspension Period.” The Note Guarantees (other than the Note Guarantee of the Issuer) will
be suspended during the Suspension Period. Additionally, upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event,
the amount of Excess Proceeds from any Asset Dispositions shall be reset to zero.

During the Suspension Period, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be entitled to incur Liens to the
extent provided for under “—Limitation on Liens” (including, without limitation, Permitted Liens) and any
Permitted Liens which may refer to one or more Suspended Covenants shall be interpreted as though such
applicable Suspended Covenant(s) continued to be applicable during the Suspension Period (but solely for
purposes of the “—Limitation on Liens” covenant and the “Permitted Liens” and “Permitted Collateral Liens”
definitions and for no other covenant).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any such reinstatement, no action taken or omitted to be
taken by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries prior to such reinstatement will give rise to a Default or
Event of Default under the Indenture, and no Default or Event of Default will be deemed to exist or have
occurred as a result of any failure by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to comply with any of the Suspended
Covenants during the Suspension Period; provided, that (1) with respect to Restricted Payments (as defined
herein) made after such reinstatement, the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments will be calculated
as though the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect
prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period (including with respect to a Applicable Transaction entered into
during the Suspension Period); (2) all Indebtedness incurred, committed or issued during the Suspension Period
(or deemed incurred or issued in connection with an Applicable Transaction entered into during the Suspension
Period) will be classified to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (iv)(A) of the second paragraph of
“—Limitation on Indebtedness”; (3) any Affiliate Transaction (as defined herein) entered into after such
reinstatement pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be
permitted pursuant to clause (vi) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Affiliate Transactions”; (4) any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to take any_
action described in clauses (i) through (iii) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during any Suspension_
Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (i) of the second paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”; (5) no Subsidiary of the
Issuer shall be required to comply with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Guarantees of
_Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries” after such reinstatement with respect to any guarantee or obligation_
entered into by such Subsidiary during any Suspension Period; and (6) all Investments made during the
Suspension Period (or deemed made in connection with an Applicable Transaction entered into during the
Suspension Period) will be classified to have been made under clause (i) of the definition of “Permitted
Investments.”

Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated after the Reversion Date, (1) no Default,
Event of Default or breach of any kind will be deemed to exist under the Indenture, the Notes or the Note
Guarantees with respect to the Suspended Covenants, and none of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries shall bear
any liability for any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period, or any actions taken at any

210


-----

time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising during any Suspension Period, in each case as a result of a
failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period (or, upon termination of the
Suspension Period or after that time based solely on any action taken or event that occurred during the
Suspension Period) and (2) following a Reversion Date, the Issuer and each Restricted Subsidiary will be
permitted, without causing a Default or Event of Default, to honor, comply with or otherwise perform any
contractual commitments or obligations arising during any Suspension Period and to consummate the
transactions contemplated thereby.

There can be no assurance that any series of Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade
Rating. The Trustee shall be notified of a Covenant Suspension Event and a Reversion Date; provided that no
such notification shall be a condition for the Covenant Suspension Event to be effective. The Trustee shall have
no duty to (i) monitor the ratings of the Notes, (ii) ascertain whether a Covenant Suspension Event or Reversion
Date have occurred or (iii) notify the Holders of any of the foregoing.

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness); provided that the Issuer and any of the Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur
Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness), if on the Applicable Test Date and after giving pro forma effect
thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), either: (i) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is
at least 2.00:1.00 or (ii) the Total Net Leverage Ratio does not exceed 5.25:1.00.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness
(collectively, “Permitted Debt”):

(i) the Incurrence by the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness under any Credit
Facility (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit, guarantees and bankers’ acceptances
thereunder) in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed the sum of:

(A) the aggregate of:

(1) €550,000,000 or, if higher, the principal amount of Facility B (EUR) as at the Issue Date

-----

any manner that complies with this covenant, the amount and type of such Indebtedness (or any portion

covenant, and Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one
provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by

(ii) all Indebtedness under Facility B, the Original Revolving Facility and/or the Notes in each case

and the Issuer shall not be permitted to reclassify all or a portion of such Indebtedness;

Indebtedness, such amount shall not include any amounts necessary to pay the aggregate amount of
accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or

preference thereof;

(viii) in the event that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments under a
revolving credit facility, enters into any commitment to Incur or issue Indebtedness or commits to Incur
any Lien pursuant to clause (cc) of the definition of “Permitted Liens,” the Incurrence or issuance thereof
for all purposes under the Indenture, including for the purposes of calculating any Applicable Metric for
borrowings and reborrowings thereunder (and including issuance and creation of letters of credit and
bankers’ acceptances thereunder) may be determined, at the Issuer’s option (A) on the date of such
revolving credit facility or such entry into or increase in commitments or (B) on the date on which such
facility or commitments become available or, if applicable, any other Applicable Test Date (assuming, in
the case of (A) and (B) of this clause (viii) that the full amount thereof (or, at the option of the Issuer, a
portion thereof) has been borrowed as of such date) and, in either case, if any such Applicable Metric is
satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any borrowing or reborrowing thereunder (and the issuance
and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be permitted under this
covenant irrespective of the Applicable Metric at the time of any borrowing or reborrowing (or issuance

or creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the committed amount permitted to be
borrowed or reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances) on a
date pursuant to the operation of this clause (viii) but not actually borrowed on such date shall be the
“Reserved Indebtedness Amount” as of such date for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the
Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Total Net Leverage
Ratio, as applicable, and, to the extent of any clause of the second paragraph of this covenant (if any),
shall be deemed to be Incurred and outstanding under such clauses);

(ix) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred to
refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on the first paragraph of this covenant or any clause
of the second paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a percentage of LTM EBITDA as of
the Applicable Test Date, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction to
be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of LTM EBITDA on the Applicable Test Date of such
refinancing, such percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as
the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such
Indebtedness being refinanced, plus the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and
expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees), including any premium and
defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred or payable
in connection with such refinancing; and

(x) except as otherwise specified herein, the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the
principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the
basis of IFRS.

Accrual and/or capitalization of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion
or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the
payment of dividends in the form of additional shares or Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the
reclassification of commitments or obligations not previously treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS,
will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this
covenant; provided that the amount of any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of any outstanding Indebtedness
may (in the Issuer’s sole discretion) be increased by the amount of all such accrued and/or capitalized interest,
accreted value, original issue discount and/or additional Indebtedness in respect of such Indebtedness and such
Increased Amount will not be deemed to be Indebtedness for the purpose of calculating any basket, permission or
threshold under which such Refinancing Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is
not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under this covenant, the Issuer shall be in default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness denominated
in a given currency, the Currency Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness (or liquidation
preference in the case of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock) denominated in another currency shall be
calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred, or,
at the option of the Issuer, first committed or first incurred or upon execution of the definitive documentation in
respect thereof (whichever yields the lower Currency Equivalent); provided that if such Indebtedness is incurred
to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in another currency, and such refinancing would cause the
applicable currency denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in
effect on the date of such refinancing, such currency denominated restriction, as applicable, shall be deemed not
to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount (or liquidation preference in the case of Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock) of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount (or liquidation
preference in the case of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock) set forth in sub-clause (c) of the definition of
“Refinancing Indebtedness”.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer
or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a
result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to
refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be
calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing
Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

Subsidiaries, and to transfer value to the holders of the Capital Stock or any Parent Entity and to Affiliates

Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries.

From the period commencing from (and including) the Initial Settlement Date and ending on the date falling
12 months after the date thereof only, any cash dividend payment in respect of the Pref Instrument by the Issuer

The Issuer will not, and the Issuer will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create,
Incur or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer), and Topco will not, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien upon
the Charged Property owned by it, in each case, whether owned on the Initial Settlement Date or acquired after
that date, or any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness
(such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except:

(i) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Charged Property:

(A) Permitted Liens; or

(B) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if obligations under the Notes and the
Indenture are directly secured equally and ratably with, or prior to, in the case of Liens with
respect to Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as
such Indebtedness is so secured; and

(ii) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Charged Property, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any Lien created in favor of the Notes pursuant to sub-clause (i)(B) of the first paragraph of this covenant
will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial
Lien to which it relates and (ii) otherwise as set forth in the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and/or under
the relevant Transaction Security Document.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time
of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such
Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such
Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms,
accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of
property securing Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Disposition
unless:

(i) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including by way of
relief from, or by any other person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) at
least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be determined on the date of contractually
agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as determined in good faith by the Issuer, of the shares and assets
subject to such Asset Disposition (including, for the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a
Permitted Asset Swap);

(ii) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions, with a purchase price in excess of
the greater of (x) €61.95 million and (y) an amount equal to 15% of LTM EBITDA, except in the case of
a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75% of the consideration for such Asset Disposition, together with all

or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of Cash Equivalent Investments; and
_provided that the amount of:_

Issuer’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent consolidated balance sheet or in the footnotes
thereto or, if Incurred or increased subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, such liabilities
that would have been reflected on the Issuer’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s consolidated
balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto if such incurrence or increase had taken place on or prior
to the date of such balance sheet, as determined by the Issuer) of the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary, other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes, that are
(1) assumed by the transferee of any such assets (or a third party in connection with such transfer)
pursuant to a written agreement which releases or indemnifies the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary from such liabilities or (2) otherwise cancelled or terminated in connection with the
transaction;

(B) any securities, notes or other obligations or assets received by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted or reasonably expected by the Issuer acting in
good faith to be converted by Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into Cash Equivalent
Investments (to the extent of the Cash Equivalent Investments received or expected to be
received) or by their terms are required to be satisfied for Cash Equivalent Investments within 180
days following the closing of such Asset Disposition; and

(C) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary in
such Asset Disposition having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other
Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (C) that is at that time
outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (x) €103.25 million and (y) an amount equal to 25% of
LTM EBITDA at the time of the receipt of such Designated Non-Cash Consideration (or, at the
Issuer’s option, at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition), with the fair
market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time
received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value,

shall each be deemed to be Cash Equivalent Investments for purposes of this provision and for no other
purpose; and

(iii) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied, to the extent
the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (at its sole discretion):

(A) to prepay, repay or purchase:

(1) any Senior Secured Indebtedness; and/or

(2) any other Permitted Debt (provided that such application would comply with the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”),

(B) to invest in or commit to invest in Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in
Additional Assets by a Restricted Subsidiary equal to the amount of Net Available Cash received
by the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary); and/or

described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” or any Permitted Investment,

in each case, within 365 days from the later of (1) the date of such Asset Disposition and (2) the receipt of
such Net Available Cash; provided that:

(1) in connection with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to
sub-clause (iii)(A) above, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such
Indebtedness and will cause the related commitment (if any) (other than in the case of any
asset-based credit facility or any revolving credit facility (including a Revolving Facility))
to be reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased;

(2) a binding commitment or letter of intent entered into not later than such 365th day shall be
treated as a permitted application of the Net Available Cash from the date of such

226


-----

commitment or letter of intent so long as the Issuer, or such Restricted Subsidiary, enters
into such commitment or letter of intent with the good faith expectation that such Net
Available Cash will be applied to satisfy such commitment or letter of intent within the
later of such 365th day and 180 days of such commitment or letter of intent (an
“Acceptable Commitment”) or, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled
or terminated for any reason before the Net Available Cash is applied in connection
therewith, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another Acceptable
Commitment (a “Second Commitment”) within 180 days of such cancellation or
termination; provided further that if any Second Commitment is later cancelled or
terminated for any reason before such Net Available Cash is applied, then such Net
Available Cash shall constitute Excess Proceeds; and

(3) pending the final application of the amount of any such Net Available Cash in accordance
with sub-clauses (iii)(A) to (iii)(C) above or otherwise in accordance with this covenant,
the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness or
otherwise use such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture.

The following amount of Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or
committed to be applied or invested as provided in the first paragraph of this covenant will be deemed to
constitute “Excess Proceeds” under the Indenture:

(i) if the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio as at the Applicable Test Date in respect of the relevant Asset
Disposition exceeds 4.00:1.00 on a pro forma basis, 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset
Disposition; or

(ii) if the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio as at the Applicable Test Date in respect of the relevant Asset
Disposition exceeds 3.75:1.00 but does not exceed 4.00:1.00 on a pro forma basis, 50% of the Net
Available Cash from such Asset Disposition; or

(iii) if the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio as at the Applicable Test Date in respect of the relevant Asset
Disposition does not exceed 3.75:1.00 on a pro forma basis, 0% of the Net Available Cash from such
Asset Disposition;

_provided that:_

(A) to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary has elected to prepay, repay or purchase any
amount of Notes or other Senior Secured Indebtedness (other than the Notes) at a price of no less
than 100% of the principal amount thereof, and has extended such offer to the Holders of the
Notes on at least a pro rata basis (or, in the case of global Notes, in accordance with the
procedures of the Relevant Clearing System) to the extent the creditors in respect of such Senior
Secured Indebtedness (including the Holders) elect not to tender their Senior Secured
Indebtedness for such prepayment, repayment or purchase, the Issuer will be deemed to have
applied an amount of Net Available Cash equal to such amount not tendered under this clause (A),
and such amount shall not increase the amount of Excess Proceeds (such amount, together with
the aggregate amount described under the fourth paragraph of this covenant, the “Declined
_Proceeds”); and_

(B) for the avoidance of doubt, Net Available Cash that will not constitute Excess Proceeds pursuant
to clause (ii) or (iii) of this paragraph above shall be immediately available to the Group for any
purposes permitted by the Indenture, including to make Restricted Payments in accordance with
clause (xxiv) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted
_Payments,” without regard to the periods specified in clause (iii) of the first paragraph of this_
covenant.

On the 366th day (or such longer period permitted by the first paragraph of this covenant) after the later of
an Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds under
this covenant exceeds the greater of (x) €103.25 million and (y) an amount equal to 25% of LTM EBITDA in a
single transaction, the Issuer will within 10 Business Days make an offer (an “Asset Disposition Offer”) to all
Holders of the Notes and, if required or permitted by the terms of any other Senior Secured Indebtedness, to the
holders of such Senior Secured Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount (or accreted
value, as applicable) of the Notes and such Senior Secured Indebtedness that may be purchased out of the Excess
Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to (i) in the case of the Notes, 100% of the principal amount

227


-----

thereof (or accreted value, if less), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for the closing of
such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture, and (ii) in the case of such other Senior
Secured Indebtedness, the offer price required by the terms thereof, in accordance with the procedures set forth in
the agreement(s) governing such Senior Secured Indebtedness.

The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Available Cash from an Asset
Disposition by making an Asset Disposition Offer with respect to such Net Available Cash prior to the expiration
of the relevant 365 days (or such longer period provided above) (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”) with
respect to all or part of the Net Available Cash (the “Advance Portion”) in advance of being required to do so by
the Indenture (an “Advance Offer”).

If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes tendered and other Senior
Secured Indebtedness, as the case may be, surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the amount offered in the
Asset Disposition Offer (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuer shall prepay, repay
or purchase the Notes and such Senior Secured Indebtedness, as the case may be, on a pro rata basis based on the
aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of the Notes or such Senior Secured Indebtedness,
as the case may be, tendered with adjustments as necessary so that no Notes or Senior Secured Indebtedness, as
the case may be, will be repurchased in part in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any such
Asset Disposition Offer (or Advance Offer), the amount of Excess Proceeds that resulted in the requirement to
make an Asset Disposition Offer shall be reset to zero (regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess
Proceeds upon such completion). Upon consummation or expiration of any Asset Disposition Offer, any
remaining Net Available Cash shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Issuer may use such Net Available
Cash for any purpose not prohibited by the Indenture.

To the extent that the aggregate amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes and Senior Secured
Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the amount offered
in the Asset Disposition Offer (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuer may use any
remaining Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) for any purposes not
otherwise prohibited under the Indenture.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this covenant, to the extent that (x) a distribution of any or all
of the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary
(to the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) is prohibited or delayed by applicable local law (including
financial assistance and corporate benefit restrictions and fiduciary and statutory duties of the relevant directors)
or (y) a distribution of any or all of the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the Issuer
or another Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) could result in material
adverse Tax consequences, as determined by the Issuer in its sole discretion, the portion of such Net Available
Cash so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant.

An Asset Disposition Offer or Advance Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with
respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, the Notes and/or the Note Guarantees (but the
Asset Disposition Offer or Advance Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents).

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other
securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with
the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer or an Advance Offer. To the extent that the
provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will
comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its
obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by
the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer
satisfies certain conditions.

The provisions under the Indenture related to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes.

For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such indebtedness not denominated in euro, such
Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amount into its Euro Equivalent amount
determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period.

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other
agreements to which the Issuer or another member of the Group becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuer

228


-----

from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing the
Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of the lenders under such agreements to the purchase of the Notes or
could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such consent
or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Issuer’s failure
to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default (subject to the relevant grace periods and other
provisions described under “—Events of Default” below) under the Indenture.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into or conduct any transaction or
series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of
any service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer (any such transaction or series of related transactions being an
“Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of (x) €41.30 million and (y) an
amount equal to 10% of LTM EBITDA unless:

(iv) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable
transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such
transaction in arm’s length dealings with a person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(v) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of (x)
€61.95 million and (y) an amount equal to 15% of LTM EBITDA, the terms of such Affiliate Transaction
have been approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer; provided that
any Affiliate Transaction shall also be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in this clause
(ii) if such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors of the Issuer, if
any.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(i) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments” or any Permitted Investment;_

(ii) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, or other
payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or entering into,
or maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other compensation arrangements,
options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any
Parent Entity, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation rights plans,
participation plans, transaction bonuses or transaction-related securities repurchase plans or similar
employee benefits or consultants’ plans (including valuation, health, insurance, deferred compensation,
severance, retirement, savings or similar plans, programs or arrangements) or indemnities provided on
behalf of officers, employees, directors or consultants approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer, in
each case in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice;

(iii) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(iv) any:

(A) transaction between or among the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted
Subsidiaries; and

(B) merger, amalgamation or consolidation with any Parent Entity; provided that such Parent Entity
shall have no material liabilities and no material assets other than cash, Cash Equivalent
Investments and the Capital Stock of the Issuer and such merger, amalgamation or consolidation is
otherwise not prohibited under the Indenture;

(v) the payment of compensation, fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities
(including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses provided on
behalf of, directors, officers, contractors, consultants, distributors or employees of the Issuer, any Parent
Entity or any Restricted Subsidiary (whether directly or indirectly and including through any Controlled
Investment Affiliate of such directors, officers, contractors, consultants, distributors or employees);

(vi) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries under the
terms of any transaction arising out of, and any payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any

229

agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the Initial Settlement Date, as these agreements and
instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed or refinanced from time to
time in accordance with the other terms of this covenant or to the extent not more disadvantageous to the
Holders (taken as a whole) in any material respect;

(vii) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Securitization Financing or Receivables Facility, any
disposition or repurchase of Securitization Assets, Receivables Assets or related assets in connection with
any Qualified Securitization Financing or Receivables Facility;

(viii) transactions with customers, clients, joint venture partners, suppliers, contractors, distributors or
purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each case in the ordinary course of business or consistent
with past practice, which are fair to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable
determination of the Board of Directors of the Issuer or the senior management of the Issuer or the
relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less favorable than those that could reasonably have
been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(ix) any transaction in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice between or among the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Issuer or an Associate or similar entity which
would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely:

(A) because the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any Permitted Holder owns an equity interest in, or otherwise
controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity; or

(B) due to the fact that a director of such person is also a director of the Issuer or any direct or indirect
Parent Entity of the Issuer (provided that such director abstains from voting as a director of the
Issuer or such direct or indirect Parent Entity of the Issuer, as the case may be, on any matter
involving such other person);

(x) any:

(A) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preferred Stock)
of the Issuer or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock or Subordinated
Shareholder Funding and the granting of registration and other customary rights (and the
performance of the related obligations) in connection therewith or any contribution to capital of
the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; and

(B) amendment, waiver or other transaction with respect to any Subordinated Shareholder Funding in
compliance with the other provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable; provided that such Subordinated Shareholder
Funding, as amended or otherwise modified, will continue to satisfy the requirements described in
the definition of Subordinated Shareholder Funding;

(A) payments by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether directly or
indirectly), including to its affiliates or its designees, of annual management, consulting,

costs and reasonable expenses and indemnitees in connection therewith and any termination fees
(including any such cash lump sum or present value fee upon the consummation of a corporate
event, including an Initial Public Offering); and

(B) customary payments by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether
directly or indirectly, including through any Parent Entity) for financial advisory, financing,

(C) payments by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether directly or
indirectly), including to its affiliates or its designees, of fees, costs and expenses reflected in the

Memorandum,

which are, in the case of each of sub-clauses (A) and (B) only, approved by a majority of the Board of
Directors of the Issuer in good faith;

connection with its direct or indirect investment in the Issuer and its Subsidiaries;

professional fees and expenses) related to the Transaction;

(xiv) transactions in which the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, delivers to the Trustee a

requirements of clause (i) of the first paragraph of this covenant;

that it may enter into thereafter; provided that the existence of, or the performance by the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary of its obligations under any future amendment to the equity holders’ agreement or
under any similar agreement entered into after the Initial Settlement Date will only be permitted under
this clause to the extent that the terms of any such amendment or new agreement are not otherwise
disadvantageous to the Holders (taken as a whole) in any material respect as determined in good faith by
the Issuer;

(xvi) any purchases by the Issuer’s Affiliates of Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or any of the
Restricted Subsidiaries the majority of which Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock is purchased by persons
who are not the Issuer’s Affiliates; provided that such purchases by the Issuer’s Affiliates are on the same
terms as such purchases by such persons who are not the Issuer’s Affiliates;

(xvii) any:

(A) Investments by Affiliates in securities of the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries (and
payment of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses Incurred by such Affiliates in connection

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit to
exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted
Subsidiary to:

(i) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay any
Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(ii) make any loans or advances to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(iii) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior_
to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the
application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to
other Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such an
encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(i) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities), (b) the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (c) any other
agreement or instrument, in each case, in effect at or entered into on the Issue Date;

Subsidiary, or was designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or on which such agreement or instrument is

Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the funds
utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Person
became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Issuer or was merged, consolidated or otherwise
combined with or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or entered into in contemplation of or in
connection with such transaction) and outstanding on such date; provided that, for the purposes of this
clause, if another Person is the Successor Company (as defined below), any Subsidiary thereof or
agreement or instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed by
the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the Successor Company;

(v) any encumbrance, restriction or condition: (A) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting,
assignment or transfer of any property or asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract or
agreement, or the assignment or transfer of any lease, license or other contract or agreement;
(B) contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements permitted under this Indenture
or securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted under this Indenture to the
extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict the transfer or encumbrance of the property or assets
subject to such mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements; (C) contained in any trading,
netting, operating, construction, service, supply, purchase, sale or other agreement to which the Issuer or
any of the Restricted Subsidiaries is a party entered into in the ordinary course of business or consistent
with past practice; provided that such agreement prohibits the encumbrance of solely the property or
assets of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary that are the subject to such agreement, the payment
rights arising thereunder or the proceeds thereof and does not extend to any other asset or property of the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary or the assets or property of another Restricted Subsidiary; or
(D) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in any
reciprocal easement agreements of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(vi) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capitalized Lease
Obligations permitted under the Indenture, in each case, that impose encumbrances or restrictions on the
property so acquired;

sale or disposition to a Person of all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary (or the property or assets that are subject to such restriction) pending the closing of
such sale or disposition;

(viii) customary provisions in leases, licenses, shareholder agreements, joint venture agreements and other
similar agreements, organizational documents and instruments;

(ix) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable rule,
regulation, licensing requirement or order, or required by any regulatory authority;

(xi) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Hedging Obligations;

(xii) restrictions created in connection with any Qualified Securitization Financing or Receivables Facility
that, in the good faith determination of the Issuer, are necessary or advisable to effect such Securitization
Facility or Receivables Facility;

(xiii) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument (a) relating to any
Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such
agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Holders (taken as a
whole) than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in (A) the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or
the Indenture, together with the Transaction Security Documents associated therewith, and (B) the
Intercreditor Agreement, in each case, as in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) as is customary in comparable
financings (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) and where, in the case of this sub-clause (ii), either
(x) the Issuer determines at the time of entry into such agreement or instrument that such encumbrances
or restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material respect, the Issuer’s ability to make principal or

233


-----

interest payments on the Notes or (y) such encumbrance or restriction applies only during the continuance
of a default relating to such agreement or instrument, or (b) constituting an Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

(xiv) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any lien permitted under the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Liens”; or

(xv) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a refinancing of
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument referred to in
clauses (i) to (xiv) of this paragraph or this clause (xv) (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in any
amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in clauses (i) to (xiv) of this
paragraph or this clause (xv); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to
such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less favorable in any
material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the
Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other
modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Issuer).

**_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation
would not cause a Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate
fair market value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries in the
Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of
the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments pursuant to the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” or under one or more clauses of the definition of “Permitted
Payments” or “Permitted Investments,” as determined by the Issuer. That designation will only be permitted if
the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of
an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The Issuer may redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary
if that redesignation would not cause a Default.

Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Issuer as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the Trustee
on the date of such designation by delivering to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such
designation complies with the preceding conditions and was permitted by the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

If the designation of any Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary fails to meet the requirements
set out in the preceding paragraph, such Subsidiary shall not be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the
Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be Incurred by it as a Restricted Subsidiary
as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is prohibited from being Incurring as of such date under the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Issuer will be in default of such covenant.

The Issuer may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; provided
that such designation will be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any
outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (1) such
Indebtedness is not prohibited under the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” (including
pursuant to clause (v) of the second paragraph thereof treating such redesignation as an acquisition for the
purpose of such clause), calculated on a pro forma basis as at the Applicable Test Date; and (2) no Event of
Default would be in existence immediately following such designation. Any designation of an Unrestricted
Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary by the Issuer shall be evidenced to the Trustee by delivering to the Trustee
an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complies with the preceding conditions.

**_Reports_**

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee the following reports following
the Issue Date:

(1) within 120 days (or if such day is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day) after
the end of each fiscal year of the Issuer (or, in the case of the first fiscal year ending after the Issue
Date, 150 days), annual reports containing: (i) the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Issuer
as at the end of the most recent two fiscal years and audited consolidated income statements and

with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations (other
than the Transaction) that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal
year as to which such annual report relates (unless such pro forma information has been provided
in a previous report pursuant to clauses (2) or (3) of the first paragraph of this covenant); provided
that such pro forma financial information will be provided only to the extent reasonably available
and without unreasonable expense, in which case the Issuer will provide, in the case of a material
acquisition, acquired company financials; (iv) a brief description of the business, management and
shareholders of the Issuer, all material affiliate transactions and a description of all material debt
instruments and (v) a summary description of any changes to material risk factors and material
recent developments; provided that the information described in clauses (iv) and (v) may be
provided in the footnotes to the audited financial statements;

(2) within 60 days (or if such day is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day) after

the first two such fiscal quarters ending after the Issue Date, 90 days), commencing with the
quarter ending after the Issue Date, quarterly financial statements containing the following
information: (i) the Issuer’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as at the end of such
quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow for the most recent quarter
year to date period ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date and the comparable
prior period, together with condensed footnote disclosure; (ii) unaudited pro forma income
statement and balance sheet information of the Issuer, together with explanatory footnotes, for any
material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations (other than the Transaction) that have
occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as to which such quarterly
report relates (unless such pro forma information has been provided in a previous report pursuant
to this clause (2) or clause (3) of the first paragraph of this covenant); provided that such pro
_forma financial information will be provided only to the extent reasonably available and without_
unreasonable expense, in which case the Issuer will provide, in the case of a material acquisition,
acquired company financials; (iii) an operating and financial review of the unaudited financial
statements, including a discussion of the consolidated financial condition, results of operations,
EBITDA and material changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Issuer and (iv) material
recent developments; provided that the information described in clause (iv) may be provided in
the footnotes to the unaudited financial statements; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Issuer announces publicly or any
acquisition, disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction that is material to the Issuer
and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or a change in a senior executive officer of the
Issuer or a change in auditors of the Issuer, a report containing a description of such event.

In addition, the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of such
parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for so long
as the Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by persons who are not “affiliates” under the
Securities Act.

All financial statement information (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the calculations made under any
incurrence covenant, which shall be prepared in accordance with the terms of this Indenture) shall be on a basis
consistent with IFRS as in effect on the date of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of
IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis for the periods presented, except as may otherwise be described
in such information; provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the
event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods. No report need include
separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the Issuer or any disclosure with respect to the results of
operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure. In addition, the reports set forth above will not be
required to contain any reconciliation to U.S. GAAP.

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to be material if the entity or
business acquired or disposed of represents greater than 20% of the Issuer’s pro forma consolidated revenue or
LTM EBITDA for the most recent four quarters for which annual or quarterly financial reports have been
delivered to the Trustee.

235


-----

At any time that any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the
Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first paragraph of this covenant will
include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes
thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries separate
from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

In the event that (i) the Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports required by
Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Issuer elects to provide to the Trustee reports which, if filed with the SEC,
would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Issuer) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of
the Exchange Act (other than the provision of U.S. GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or information as
to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Trustee such
annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the
SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d).

All reports provided pursuant to this covenant shall be in English, or with a certified English translation.

Subject to compliance with the next subsequent paragraph, in the event that, and for so long as, the equity
securities of the Issuer or any Parent Entity or IPO Entity are listed on the Main Market of the London Stock
Exchange (or one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock
Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange) and the Issuer or such Parent
Entity or IPO Entity is subject to the admission and disclosure standards applicable to issuers of equity securities
admitted to trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange (or the equivalent standards applicable to
issuers of equity securities admitted to trading on one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the
Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or the New York Stock
Exchange), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information,
documents and other reports that the Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the London Stock Exchange (or
one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange) pursuant to such admission and disclosure
standards (or the applicable standards of one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange, as
applicable). Upon complying with the foregoing requirements, and provided that such requirements require the
Issuer or any Parent Entity or IPO Entity to prepare and file annual reports, information, documents and other
reports with the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange, or one or more of the equivalent regulated markets
of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or the New York
Stock Exchange, as applicable, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in this
covenant.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may comply with any requirement to provide reports or financial
statements under this covenant by providing (x) any report or financial statements of (i) any IPO Entity or
(ii) any direct or indirect Parent Entity of the Issuer so long as such reports (if an annual or quarterly report) meet
the requirements (including as to content and time of delivery) of this covenant as if references to the Issuer
therein were references to the IPO Entity or such Parent Entity; or (y) any report or financial statements of (i) the
Company or (ii) a direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Issuer that represents substantially all the assets of the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (any entity under sub-clause (y), a “Reporting Subsidiary” and together
with the Issuer or any entity under sub-clause (x), a “Financial Reporting Entity” (as determined at the sole
discretion of the Issuer)) so long as such reports (if an annual or quarterly report) meet the requirements
(including as to content and time of delivery) of this covenant as if references to the Issuer therein were
references to the Reporting Subsidiary. Upon complying with the requirements set forth in the preceding
sentence, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in this covenant.

For purposes of this covenant and any determination or calculation to be made under the Indenture, the
Issuer may use financial statements of any Financing Reporting Entity (or a predecessor thereof) for reporting or
making calculations under the Indenture.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

Topco and the Issuer shall not, and the Issuer shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or
knowingly or negligently omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security
Interest with respect to the Charged Property (it being understood that (i) the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral

236


-----

Liens or the confirmation or affirmation of security interests in respect of the Charged Property, (ii) the
occurrence of or implementation or any step in the Transaction or any Permitted Transaction and (iii) the
implementation of an IPO Pushdown shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security
Interest with respect to the Charged Property) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and Topco and the
Issuer shall not, and the Issuer shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the
Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the
Transaction Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any
interest in any of the Charged Property that is prohibited by the covenants described under “—Limitation on
_Liens”; provided, that Topco, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur any Lien over any of the_
Charged Property that is not prohibited by the covenants described under “—Limitation on Liens”, including
Permitted Collateral Liens, and the Charged Property may be discharged, transferred or released in any
circumstances not prohibited by the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Transaction Security
Documents.

Notwithstanding the first paragraph of this covenant, nothing in this covenant shall restrict the discharge,
transfer or release of any Charged Property or Lien in any circumstance in accordance with the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and/or the Transaction Security Documents.
Subject to the foregoing, the Transaction Security Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated,
supplemented, replaced or otherwise modified or released (1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or
inconsistency therein; (2) for the purposes of Incurring Permitted Collateral Liens; (3) to add to the Charged
Property; (4) for the purposes of undertaking any Permitted Transaction, a Permitted Tax Restructuring, an IPO
Pushdown, the Transaction and/or or a transaction not prohibited by the covenants described under “—Merger
_and Consolidation,” (5) to make any other change thereto that does not adversely affect the Holders in any_
material respect; or (6) to amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, replace or otherwise modify or release any
Transaction Security Documents followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over
the same assets; provided, however, that in the case of clauses (5) and (6) above, no Transaction Security
Document may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, replaced or otherwise modified or
released unless contemporaneously with such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement supplement,
replacement or modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent
ranking over the same assets), the Issuer delivers to the Security Agent and the Trustee, either (i) a solvency
opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Security Agent and the Trustee, from an
Independent Financial Advisor or appraiser or investment bank of international standing which confirms the
solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, replacement, modification or release (followed by an
immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), (ii) a certificate from the chief
financial officer or the Board of Directors of the relevant Person which confirms the solvency of the person
granting any such Lien after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, replacement, modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at
least equivalent ranking over the same assets) or (iii) an Opinion of Counsel (subject to any qualifications
customary for this type of Opinion of Counsel), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee,
confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, replacement, modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at
least equivalent ranking over the same assets), the Lien or Liens created under the Transaction Security
Document, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, replaced, modified or released (followed by
an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets) are valid and perfected Liens
not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien
or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, replacement, modification or release and to which the new Indebtedness secured by the Permitted
Collateral Lien is not subject.

In the event that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries comply with the requirements of this covenant, the
Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement and customary
protections and indemnifications) consent to such actions without the need for instructions from the Holders.

**_Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries_**

Subject to and in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles and the Guarantee Limitations, the Issuer
shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary, other than a Guarantor or a Securitization Subsidiary, to Guarantee
the payment of (i) any syndicated Credit Facility or (ii) Public Debt of the Issuer or any Guarantor in an

237


-----

aggregate principal amount in excess of the greater of (x) €103.25 million and (y) 25% of LTM EBITDA at such
time, unless:

(i) such Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor within 60 days after the guarantee of such
Indebtedness; and

(ii) if applicable, executes and delivers a supplemental indenture to the Indenture providing for a Note
Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary, which will be senior or pari passu with, as applicable, such
Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee of such other Indebtedness, except that with respect to a guarantee of
Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor, if such Indebtedness is by its express terms subordinated in
right of payment to the Notes or such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee, any such guarantee by such Restricted
Subsidiary with respect to such Indebtedness shall be subordinated in right of payment to such Note
Guarantee substantially to the same extent as such Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes.

Notwithstanding the first paragraph of this covenant, no Restricted Subsidiary shall be obligated to become
a Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Guarantee of the Facilities is contrary to the
Agreed Security Principles or the Guarantee Limitations or could give rise to or result in:

(i) any breach or violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent
preference, thin capitalization rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules, retention
of title claims or the laws, rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction;

(ii) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a
partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a
partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or

(iii) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out
of pocket expenses.

At the option of the Issuer, any Note Guarantee may contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the extent
reasonably necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including the Guarantee
Limitations and those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance,
corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally) or other considerations under applicable law (including any usury laws).

The Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to cause any Subsidiary that is not otherwise required to be a
Guarantor to become a Guarantor, in which case such Subsidiary shall not be required to comply with the 60-day
period described in this covenant. The Indenture will provide that this covenant shall not be applicable to any
guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary that existed at the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary and
was not incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary.

Future Note Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under “—Note
_Guarantees—Note Guarantee Releases.” A Note Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the_
option of the Issuer if, at the date of such release, there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which
was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with this Indenture as at
the date of such release if such Guarantor were not designated as a Guarantor as at that date. The validity and
enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of each Guarantor will be
subject to the limitations as described and set out in “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our
_Structure—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Note_
_Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and_
_the Collateral” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability_
_of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the Incurrence by the Issuer
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of: (i) any Indebtedness secured on Charged Property or as otherwise
required or not prohibited herein; and (ii) any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness referred to in
sub-clause (i) above, the Issuer, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall
enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized representatives) an intercreditor
agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) or a restatement, amendment or other modification of the
existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not
materially less favorable to the Holders (taken as a whole)), including substantially the same terms with respect

238


-----

to release of Note Guarantees and priority and release of the Security Interests, provided that: (A) such
Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security
Agent or, in the reasonable opinion of the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the
rights, duties, liabilities, indemnities or immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent under the Indenture, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement; and (B) if more than one such intercreditor
agreement is outstanding at any time, the correlative terms of such intercreditor agreements must not conflict.

The Indenture will also provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders, the
Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, manifest error
or inconsistency of any such agreement; (ii) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such
agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement
(including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of
provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes and the Note
Guarantees); (iii) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor
Agreement; (iv) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes); (v) make provision for equal and ratable
pledges of the Charged Property to secure Additional Notes; (vi) to facilitate a Permitted Tax Restructuring, a
Permitted Reorganization or the Transaction; (vii) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens; (viii) amend the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof; or
(ix) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders (taken as a whole)
in any material respect, making all necessary provisions to ensure that the Notes and the Note Guarantees are
secured by first-priority Liens over the Charged Property.

The Indenture will also provide that the Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to
enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, other than:
(i) in accordance with the second paragraph of this covenant; (ii) with the consent of the requisite majority of
Holders except as otherwise permitted below under “—Amendments and Waivers” or (iii) as otherwise permitted
by such Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, and the Issuer may only direct the
Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any
personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent or, in the reasonable opinion of the Trustee or the
Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities, indemnities or immunities under this
Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the requisite majority of
Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of
any obligations subordinated to the Notes thereby, provided that such transaction would comply with the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to
and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
(whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein), and to have
directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Financial and Other Calculations_**

For the purpose of calculating any Applicable Metric (including the financial definitions or components
thereof but excluding for the avoidance of doubt Excess Cash Flow) in the Note Documents, including when
determining (or, as applicable, forecasting) Consolidated EBITDA for any Relevant Period (including the portion
thereof occurring prior to any relevant Purchase (as defined below)), the Issuer may: (a) if during such period any
member of the Group (by merger or otherwise) has made or committed (unilaterally, conditionally or otherwise)
to make an Investment in any person that thereby becomes (or that the Issuer expects in good faith, based upon
such commitment, will become) a Restricted Subsidiary or otherwise has acquired or committed (unilaterally,
conditionally or otherwise) to acquire any entity, business, property or material fixed asset (including the
acquisition, opening and/or development of any new site or operation) (any such Investment, acquisition or
commitment therefor, a “Purchase”), including any such Purchase occurring in connection with a transaction
causing a calculation to be made under this Agreement or the other Finance Documents, calculate Consolidated
EBITDA for such period on the basis that the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization
(calculated on the same basis as Consolidated EBITDA, mutatis mutandis) attributable to the assets which are the
subject of such Purchase during such Relevant Period shall be included as if the Purchase occurred on the first

239


-----

day of such Relevant Period; and/or (b) include an adjustment in respect of any Purchase and/or any steps taken
or committed (in each case, unilaterally, conditionally or otherwise) to be taken in respect of such Purchase up to
the amount of the pro forma increase in Consolidated EBITDA projected by the Company (in good faith) after
taking into account the full “run rate” effect of: (i) all Synergies which the Company (in good faith) determines
have been or will be achieved (in full or in part) at any time during such Relevant Period directly or indirectly as
a consequence of the Purchase or any related steps, without prejudice to the Synergies actually realized during
the Relevant Period and already included in Consolidated EBITDA provided that so long as such Synergies have
been realized at any time during such Relevant Period, it may be assumed they were realized during the entirety
of such Relevant Period; and/or (ii) all Synergies which the Issuer (in good faith) believes can be achieved within
the applicable Look-Forward Period directly or indirectly as a consequence of the Purchase or any related steps
(the “Forward-Looking Purchase Synergies”), provided that so long as such Forward-Looking Purchase
Synergies will be realizable at any time during such Look-Forward Period, it may be assumed they will be
realizable during the entire Look-Forward Period; in each case, without prejudice to the Synergies actually
realized during the Relevant Period and already included in Consolidated EBITDA; and/or (c) exclude any
non-recurring fees, costs and expenses directly or indirectly related to the Purchase.

For the purpose of calculating any Applicable Metric (including the financial definitions or components
thereof but excluding for the avoidance of doubt Excess Cash Flow) in the Note Documents, including when
determining (or, as applicable, forecasting) Consolidated EBITDA for any Relevant Period (including the portion
thereof occurring prior to any relevant Sale (as defined below)), the Issuer may: (a) if during such period any
member of the Group has disposed or committed (unilaterally, conditionally or otherwise) to make a disposal of
any person, property, business or material fixed asset or any group of assets constituting an operating unit of a
business sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of by the Group (any such sale, transfer, disposition or
commitment therefor, a “Sale”) or if the transaction giving rise to the need to calculate Consolidated EBITDA
relates to such a Sale, calculate Consolidated EBITDA for such period on the basis that Consolidated EBITDA
will be reduced by an amount equal to the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization and
impairment (calculated on the same basis as Consolidated EBITDA, mutatis mutandis) (if positive) attributable
to the assets which are the subject of such Sale for such period or increased by an amount equal to the earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization and impairment (calculated on the same basis as Consolidated
EBITDA, mutatis mutandis) (if negative) attributable thereto for such period as if the Sale occurred on the first
day of such Relevant Period; and/or (b) include an adjustment in respect of any Sale and/or any steps taken or
committed (in each case, unilaterally, conditionally or otherwise) to be taken in respect of such Sale up to the
amount of the pro forma increase in Consolidated EBITDA projected by the Issuer (in good faith) after taking
into account the full “run rate” effect of: (i) all Synergies which the Company (in good faith) determines have
been or will be achieved (in full or in part) at any time during such Relevant Period directly or indirectly as a
consequence of the Sale or any related steps, without prejudice to the Synergies actually realized during the
Relevant Period and already included in Consolidated EBITDA provided that so long as such Synergies have
been realized at any time during such Relevant Period, it may be assumed they were realized during the entirety
of such Relevant Period; and/or (ii) all Synergies which the Issuer (in good faith) believes can be achieved within
the applicable Look-Forward Period directly or indirectly as a consequence of the Sale or any related steps (the
“Forward-Looking Sale Synergies”), provided that so long as such Forward-Looking Sale Synergies will be
realizable at any time during such Look-Forward Period, it may be assumed they will be realizable during the
entire Look-Forward Period; in each case, without prejudice to the Synergies actually realized during the
Relevant Period and already included in Consolidated EBITDA; and/or (c) exclude any non-recurring fees, costs
and expenses directly or indirectly related to the Sale.

For the purpose of calculating any Applicable Metric (including the financial definitions or components
thereof but excluding for the avoidance of doubt Excess Cash Flow) in the Note Documents, including when
determining (or, as applicable, forecasting) Consolidated EBITDA for any Relevant Period (including the portion
thereof occurring prior to implementing or committing to implement such Group Initiative), the Issuer may:
(a) include an adjustment in respect of each Group Initiative and/or any steps taken or committed (in each case,
unilaterally, conditionally or otherwise) to be taken in respect of such Group Initiative up to the amount of the
pro forma increase in Consolidated EBITDA projected by the Issuer (in good faith) after taking into account the
full “run rate” effect of: (i) all Synergies which the Issuer (in good faith) determines have been or will be
achieved (in full or in part) at any time during such Relevant Period directly or indirectly as a consequence of
implementing or committing to implement such Group Initiative or any related steps, without prejudice to the
Synergies actually realized during the Relevant Period and already included in Consolidated EBITDA provided
that so long as such Synergies have been realized at any time during such Relevant Period, it may be assumed
they were realized during the entirety of such Relevant Period; and/or (ii) all Synergies which the Issuer (in good

240


-----

faith) believes can be achieved within the applicable Look-Forward Period directly or indirectly as a consequence
of implementing or committing to implement such Group Initiative or any related steps (the “Forward-Looking
_Group Initiative Synergies” and together with the Forward-Looking Purchase Synergies and the Forward-_
Looking Sale Synergies, the “Forward-Looking Synergies”), provided that so long as such Forward-Looking
Group Initiative Synergies will be realizable at any time during such Look-Forward Period, it may be assumed
they will be realizable during the entire Look-Forward Period; in each case, without prejudice to the Synergies
actually realized during the Relevant Period and already included in Consolidated EBITDA; and/or (b) exclude
any non-recurring fees, costs and expenses directly or indirectly related to the implementation of, or commitment
to, implement such Group Initiative.

In relation to the definitions set out in the Indenture and all other related provisions of the Notes Documents
(including any Applicable Metric), all calculations in respect of Synergies (in each case actual or anticipated)
may be made as though the full run-rate effect of such Synergies were realized on the first day of the Relevant
Period.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary (including anything in the financial definitions set out in the
Indenture), when calculating any Applicable Metric, the financial definitions or component thereof but excluding
Excess Cash Flow, the Issuer shall be permitted to: (a) exclude all or any part of any expenditure or other
negative item (and/or the impact thereof) directly or indirectly relating to or resulting from: (i) the Transaction;
(ii) any other acquisition, Investment or other joint venture permitted by the terms of the Indenture or the impact
from purchase price accounting; (iii) start-up costs for new businesses and branding or re-branding of existing
businesses; (iv) Restructuring Costs; (v) research and development expenditure (and the capitalization thereof);
and/or (vi) the implementation of IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) and/or IFRS 16 (Leases)
and, in each case, any successor standard thereto (or any equivalent measure under the accounting principles) or
any other changes in the applicable accounting principles; and/or (b) include any addbacks (without further
verification or diligence) for adjustments (including anticipated Synergies) or costs or expenses related to the
Transaction and/or any base case model or quality of earnings report relating to a Permitted Acquisition prepared
by an independent third party and and/or taken into account in determining “As Adjusted EBITDA” or any
financing EBITDA to be used in connection with financing for a Permitted Acquisition and/or any research and
development expenditure (which is not otherwise capitalized).

When calculating the satisfaction of or availability under any Applicable Metric in the Indenture in
connection with any Applicable Transaction, the date of determination of such Applicable Metric shall, at the
option of the Issuer, be any Applicable Test Date. If the Issuer elects to determine any Applicable Metric as of
any Applicable Test Date, it shall give pro forma effect to any other Applicable Transactions that have occurred
up to (and including) such Applicable Test Date; provided that the pro forma calculation may exclude any
non-recurring fees, costs and expenses attributable to any Applicable Transaction.

If compliance with an Applicable Metric is established in accordance with the preceding paragraph, such
Applicable Metric shall be deemed to have been complied with (or satisfied) for all purposes; provided that
(a) the Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to recalculate any Applicable Metric on the basis of a more recent
Applicable Test Date, in which case, such date of redetermination shall thereafter be deemed to be the relevant
Applicable Test Date for purposes of such Applicable Metrics; and (b) save as contemplated in clause (a) above,
compliance with any Applicable Metric shall not be determined or tested at any time after the relevant
Applicable Test Date for such transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto.

If any Applicable Metric for which compliance was determined or tested as of an Applicable Test Date
would at any time after the Applicable Test Date have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been complied
with as a result of fluctuations in such Applicable Metric (or any other Applicable Metric), such Applicable
Metric will not be deemed to have been exceeded or failed to have been complied with as a result of such
fluctuations.

If any related requirements and conditions (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event
of Default) for which compliance or satisfaction was determined or tested as of the Applicable Test Date would
at any time after the Applicable Test Date not have been complied with or satisfied (including due to the
occurrence or continuation of a Default or an Event of Default), such requirements and conditions will not be
deemed to have been failed to be complied with or satisfied (and such Default or Event of Default shall be
deemed not to have occurred or be continuing).

Subject to clause (viii) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness,” in calculating the availability under any Applicable Metric in connection with any action or_

241


-----

transaction unrelated to the Applicable Transaction following the relevant Applicable Test Date and prior to the
earlier of the date on which such Applicable Transaction is consummated or the Issuer determines (in its sole
discretion) that such Applicable Transaction will not be consummated, any such Applicable Metric shall be
determined or tested giving pro forma effect to such Applicable Transaction.

If an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) is committed,
incurred or issued, any Lien is committed or incurred or any other transaction is undertaken or any Applicable
Metric is tested in reliance on a ratio-based basket based on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Senior Secured
Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Total Net Leverage Ratio or any other ratio
based Applicable Metric, such ratios shall be calculated without regard to the Incurrence of any Indebtedness to
finance the working capital needs of the Group under any revolving facility, letter of credit facility or bank
guarantee facility and/or other debt which is available to be re-drawn (including under any Revolving Facility or
any ancillary facility under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement) and, for the avoidance of doubt, any
undrawn commitments for Indebtedness (including under a Revolving Facility) shall be disregarded for the
purposes of testing the Applicable Metric.

If, in connection with the same Applicable Transaction or otherwise substantially simultaneously: (a)(i) any
Applicable Metrics required to be determined by reference to a fixed currency amount or a percentage of LTM
EBITDA (a “fixed permission”) are intended to be utilized; and/or (ii) revolving Indebtedness (other than
Indebtedness under the Reserved Indebtedness Amount) is intended to be Incurred; and (b) any Applicable
Metric required to be determined by reference to the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Secured Net
Leverage Ratio, the Total Net Leverage Ratio, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or any other ratio-based
Applicable Metric (a “ratio-based permission”) are intended to be utilized (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
any determination of any increase or decrease in any such Applicable Metric, including in accordance with the
clauses (v)(B)(1), (v)(B)(2) or (v)(B)(3) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Indebtedness,” then (x) amounts available to be incurred under the applicable ratio-based permissions shall_
first be calculated without giving effect to amounts to be incurred under the applicable fixed permissions or the
applicable Incurrence of revolving Indebtedness, or amounts previously incurred under such fixed permissions
and not reclassified that are being repaid in connection with such Applicable Transaction, unless otherwise
elected by the Issuer; and (y) thereafter, compliance with any relevant fixed permissions shall be calculated, and
in each case, full pro forma effect shall be given to all increases to LTM EBITDA and repayments or discharges
of Indebtedness in connection with such Applicable Transaction in accordance with this Agreement.

In the event that any amount or transaction meets the criteria of more than one Applicable Metric, the Issuer
may (in its sole discretion), limitations imposed under clause (ii) of the third paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” classify and reclassify that amount or transaction to a particular
Applicable Metric and will only be required to include that amount or transaction in one of those Applicable
Metrics (and, for the avoidance of doubt, an amount may at the option of the Issuer be split between different
Applicable Metrics).

Subject to the limitations imposed under clause (ii) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Indebtedness,” if a proposed action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) is
incurred or entered into pursuant to a fixed permission and at a later time would subsequently be permitted under
a ratio-based permission, unless otherwise elected by the Issuer, such action, matter, transaction or amount (or a
portion thereof) shall automatically be reclassified to such ratio-based permission.

The Indenture will provide that references to (i) any matter being “permitted” under the Indenture or any
other Notes Document shall include references to such matters not being prohibited or otherwise being approved
under the Indenture or such other Notes Document and (ii) any transaction being in the “ordinary course of
business” of a member of the Group shall be construed to include any transaction that is consistent with industry
practice in the industries in which the Group operates or consistent with past practice of any member of the
Group or A-M Group.

For any relevant Applicable Metric set by reference to a fiscal year, a calendar year, a Relevant Period, a
four-quarter period, a twelve-month period or any other similar annual period (each an “Annual Period”):

(i) at the option of the Issuer, the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric during such
Annual Period may be increased by: (A) an amount equal to 100% of the difference (if positive) between the
permitted amount in the immediately preceding Annual Period and the amount thereof actually used or
applied by the Group during such preceding Annual Period (the “Carry Forward Amount”); and/or (B) an
amount equal to 100% of the permitted amount in the immediately following Annual Period and the

242


-----

permitted amount in such immediately following Annual Period shall be reduced by such corresponding
amount (the “Carry Back Amount”); and

(ii) to the extent that the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric during such Annual
Period is increased in accordance with clause (i) above, any usage of such Applicable Metric during such
Annual Period shall be deemed to be applied in the following order: (A) first, against the Carry Forward
Amount; (B) second, against the maximum amount so permitted during such Annual Period prior to any
increase in accordance with clause (i) above; and (C) third, against the Carry Back Amount.

**Merger and Consolidation**

_The Issuer_

The Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise
dispose of all or substantially all its assets, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any person,
unless:

(i) the resulting, surviving or transferee person (the “Successor Company”) will be a person organized and
existing under the laws of the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Finland, United States, a Member State of the
European Union, and the Successor Company (if not the Issuer) will expressly assume, by way of
supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Issuer under the
Indenture, the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Transaction
Security Documents and any other Notes Documents, as applicable;

(ii) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the applicable Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the applicable Successor Company as
a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the applicable Successor Company or such
Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and:

(A) the Issuer or the Successor Company would be able to Incur at least an additional €1.00 of
Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness”; or_

(B) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would not be lower, or the Total Net Leverage Ratio would not be
higher, than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction;

(iii) the Issuer or the Successor Company, as the case may be, shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such
supplemental indenture comply with the Indenture; provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel
may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact; and

(iv) the Holders (or the Security Agent on their behalf) will continue to have the same or substantially equivalent
(ignoring for the purposes of assessing such equivalency any limitations required in accordance with the
Agreed Security Principles or hardening periods (or any similar or equivalent concept)) guarantees and
security over the same or substantially equivalent assets and over the shares (or other interests) in the Issuer
or the Successor Company, save to the extent such assets or shares (or other interests) cease to exist
(provided that if the shares (or other interests) in the Issuer cease to exist, security will be granted (subject to
the Agreed Security Principles) over the shares (or other interests) in the Successor Company).

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of,
the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture.

_Guarantors_

No Guarantor may:

(i) consolidate with or merge with or into any person;

(ii) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or dispose of, all or substantially all its assets, in one transaction or a
series of related transactions, to any person; or

(iii) permit any person to merge with or into such Guarantor,

unless:

(A) the other person is the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor (or becomes a Guarantor
substantially concurrently with the transaction); or

243


-----

(B) either (x) the Issuer or a Guarantor is the continuing person or (y) the resulting, surviving or transferee
person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor under the Indenture and all obligations
of the Issuer under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the
Transaction Security Documents, as applicable, and immediately after giving effect to the transaction,
no Event of Default is continuing; or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of
the Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (in each
case other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Indenture.

The Indenture will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed, with
respect to the Notes it holds, not to exercise, and thereby waives in advance, its right in accordance with the
Finnish Companies Act (624/2006, as amended) to object any such merger that is otherwise permitted in this
covenant.

_General_

The provisions set forth in this covenant shall not restrict (and shall not apply to):

(i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor from consolidating with, merging or
liquidating into or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer, a Guarantor or
any other Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor;

(ii) any Guarantor from merging or liquidating into or transferring all or part of its properties and assets to the
Issuer or another Guarantor;

(iii) any consolidation or merger of the Issuer into any Guarantor; provided that, if the Issuer is not the surviving
entity of such merger or consolidation:

(A) the relevant Guarantor will assume the obligations of the Issuer (as applicable) under the Notes, the
Indenture, the Note Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
and the Transaction Security Documents and with respect to the Issuer, clauses (i), (iii) and (iv) of the
covenant described under “—The Issuer” above shall apply to such transaction; and

(B) to the extent that any Transaction Security previously granted over the shares in the capital of the
relevant Guarantor would not, in accordance with applicable law, constitute a Lien over the shares in
the capital of the surviving entity, the direct Parent Holding Company of the surviving entity shall,
subject to the Agreed Security Principles, grant Transaction Security over the shares in the capital of
the surviving entity on substantially equivalent terms to any Security Interests granted over the shares
in the capital of such predecessor Guarantor immediately prior to such merger or consolidation;

(iv) the Issuer or any Guarantor consolidating into or merging or combining with an Affiliate incorporated or
organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of such entity, reincorporating such entity in
another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such entity; provided that, in the case of a consolidation,
merger or combination of:

(A) the Issuer into or with an Affiliate that is not a Guarantor, clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of the covenant
described under “—The Issuer” shall apply to such transaction; and

(B) any Guarantor into or with an Affiliate, sub-clause (iii) above shall apply to such transaction; or

(v) the Transaction or any Permitted Transaction (other than in respect of the proposed merger of the Issuer
with any of its Affiliates as described under the final tax structure memorandum in respect of which
clauses (i), (iii) and (iv) of the covenant described under “—The Issuer” shall apply to such transaction).

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction
would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

This covenant shall not apply to the creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, this covenant will not prohibit or restrict the
Transaction or any Permitted Transaction, in each case, which shall be expressly permitted under this covenant.

**Events of Default**

Subject to the two succeeding paragraphs, each of the following is an Event of Default under the Indenture:

(a) default in any payment of interest on any Note when due and payable, continued for 30 days;

244


-----

(b) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note when due at its Stated
Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise, continued for
five Business Days;

(c) failure by the Issuer or any Guarantor to comply for 60 days after written notice by the Trustee on behalf of
the Holders or by the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes with
any agreement or obligation contained in the Indenture;

(d) the occurrence of any default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued
or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any
Significant Subsidiary (other than any default that may occur in respect of the Existing Debt on or prior to
the end of the Clean-up Period) or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Issuer or any Significant
Subsidiary in each case other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, whether such
Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the date hereof, which default:

(i) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness, at its stated final maturity (after giving
effect to any applicable grace periods) provided in such Indebtedness (a “payment default”); or

(ii) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity (the “cross-acceleration
_provision”),_

and, in each case, the aggregate principal amount of all Indebtedness subject to such payment defaults or
accelerations (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), is in excess of the greater of (x)
€103.25 million and (y) an amount equal to 25% of LTM EBITDA;

(e) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of Topco, the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary
(the “bankruptcy provisions”) which, in each case, are sanctioned by a court and become unconditional;

(f) failure by the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of the greater
of (x) €103.25 million and (y) an amount equal to 25% of LTM EBITDA, other than any judgments covered
by indemnities provided by, or insurance policies issued by, reputable and creditworthy companies, which
final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than 60 days (after receipt
of notice from the Trustee) after such judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by
insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree
which is not promptly stayed (the “judgment default provision”);

(g) any Security Interest under the Transaction Security Documents having a fair market value in excess of the
greater of (x) €41.30 million and (y) an amount equal to 10% of LTM EBITDA shall, at any time, cease to
be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Transaction Security
Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture) for any
reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture or the release of any such
Security Interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement or the Transaction Security Documents or any such Security Interest created
thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall assert
in writing that any such Security Interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Default continues for 30
days (the “security default provisions”); and

(h) except as permitted under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (including with respect to any limitations), any Note Guarantee of any one or more Guarantors
that a Significant Subsidiary is held in any judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid or ceases for
any reason to be in full force and effect, or any one or more Guarantors that is an Issuer or a Significant
Subsidiary denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Note Guarantee (the “guarantee default
_provisions”)._

However, a Default under clauses (d) or (f) of the first paragraph above will not constitute an Event of
Default unless (i) the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Notes have notified the Issuer of the Default and (ii) the Issuer has not cured such Default within 60 days after
receipt of such notice; provided that notice of Default may not be given with respect to any action taken or
reported to the Trustee more than 2 years prior to such notice of Default. Any time period providing for the cure
of any actual or alleged Default or Event of Default described under the first paragraph of this section may be
extended or stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction to the extent such actual or alleged Default or Event of
Default is the subject of litigation.

245


-----

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (e) of the first paragraph of this
section) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by written notice to the Issuer, or the Holders of at least 30% in
principal amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee
(subject to certain conditions) at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of and accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal and
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of
acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (d) has occurred and is continuing, the
declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default
triggering such Event of Default pursuant to such clause (d) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders
of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in
full, in each case, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and the annulment of
the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

If an Event of Default described in clause (e) of the first paragraph of this section occurs and is continuing,
the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and
payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce
the Transaction Security Documents except as provided in such Transaction Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may
waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to non-payment of principal,
premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note held by a non-consenting Holder, which may only
be waived with the consent of Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Notes) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences (including the payment
default that resulted from such acceleration) if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a
court of competent jurisdiction.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required
certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is
cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another
default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and
(ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant
titled “—Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other
provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such
covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period
specified in the Indenture.

On or prior to the end of the Clean-up Period, (i) none of the debt of the Group existing under the Existing
Debt or security relating thereto and (ii) no breach of representation, warranty, undertaking or other term of (or
default or event of default under) the Existing Debt arising as a direct or indirect result of the entry into or
performance of obligations under the Notes Documents shall constitute a breach of (or Default or Event of
Default) under any Notes Document.

The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the
request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or
security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce
the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to
the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing the
Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security and/or
indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request
and the offer of security and/or indemnity; and

246


-----

(5) the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a
written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such
60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are
given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, of which a
responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its
powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee,
however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee
determines (after consultation with counsel) is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would
involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be
entitled to indemnification and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against all fees, losses,
liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.

The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and a responsible officer of the Trustee
is informed in writing of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders
within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or
premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee in good
faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders.

The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days (or if such day is not a Business Day, on the
next succeeding Business Day) after the end of each fiscal year (or in the case of the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2021, 150 days), an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any
Default that has occurred during the previous year, and is continuing. The Issuer is required to deliver to the
Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events that are continuing of which it
is aware the occurrence of which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is
taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Except as provided in the next two succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture and the other Note Documents may
be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or
tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any existing Default or Event
of Default (other than a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal or premium, Additional
Amounts, if any, or interest on any Note (including in connection with an offer to purchase), except a payment
default resulting from an acceleration that has been rescinded) or compliance with any provision of the Indenture
and the other Note Documents may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or
tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes). If any amendment, supplement or waiver will only affect one or
more series of Notes (but not all series of Notes), only the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the then outstanding Notes of the series so affected (and not the consent of the Holders of at least a
majority in aggregate principal amount of all Notes then outstanding), shall be required.

However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% (or, in the case of clauses (7) and (9) of
this paragraph, 80%) of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes (provided, however, that if any
amendment, supplement, waiver or other modification or consent will only affect one or more series of Notes
(but not all series of Notes), only the consent of the holders of at least 90% (or, in the case of clauses (7) and (9)
below, 80%) of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of the series so affected will be
required), an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Note (other than
provisions relating to a Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(2) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Note (other than provisions relating to
a Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(3) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Note or change the time at which any
such Note may be redeemed, in each case as described under “—Optional Redemption” and
“—Redemption for Taxation Reasons”;

247


-----

(4) make any such Note payable in currency other than that stated in such Note;

(5) impair the contractual right of any Holder of any outstanding Note to institute suit for the enforcement
of any payment of principal of, or interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on such Holder’s Notes on or
after the due dates therefor;

(6) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture described under “—Withholding Taxes” that
adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends the terms of
such Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described
thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder
unless the applicable Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(7) release all or substantially all Security Interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Charged
Property (taken as a whole) other than in accordance with the terms of the Transaction Security
Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the
Indenture; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt and without prejudice to the provisions governing
a Change of Control, the release of less than all or substantially all Security Interests granted for the
benefit of the Holders in the Charged Property (taken as a whole) shall only require the consent of
Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents
obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) and any default
or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a
majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection
with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes);

(8) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest or
Additional Amounts, if any (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders
of at least a majority in principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment default that
resulted from such acceleration);

(9) release any Guarantor from its obligations under its Note Guarantee or this Indenture, except in
accordance with the terms of this Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(10) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose holders must consent to any amendment, waiver or
modification or make any other change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the
Holders’ consent described in this sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee and the other
parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Note Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect, error or inconsistency or reduce the minimum
denomination of the Notes;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person or a co-issuer of the obligations of the Issuer or a
Guarantor under any Note Document, including, without limitation, in connection with a Permitted
Transaction;

(3) add to the covenants, add an obligor or provide for a Note Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or
surrender any right or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or
make any change (including changing the ISIN, common code, CUSIP or other identifying number on
any Notes) that does not adversely affect the rights of the Trustee or any Holder in any material
respect;

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a member
of senior management of the Issuer) for the issuance of Additional Notes that may be issued in
compliance with this Indenture;

(6) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Guarantee in accordance with the covenants
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries,” to add Note Guarantees with_
respect to the Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of the Notes, or to confirm and evidence the
release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Note Guarantee or Lien with respect to or securing
the Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking is provided for under the Indenture, the
Transaction Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

248


-----

(7) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under any Debt Document of a successor
Trustee or successor security agent pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession
by the Trustee or Security Agent to any Note Document;

(8) in the case of the Transaction Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a
Security Interest in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, in any property which is required by the Transaction Security
Documents to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a Security Interest is required to be
granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a Security Interest in the Charged
Property for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such Security Interest is not
prohibited by the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and
the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” is complied
with;

(9) conform the text of the Indenture, the Transaction Security Documents or the Notes to any provision of
this “Description of the Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of the Notes” was
intended to be a recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Transaction Security Documents or the
Notes;

(10) make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of Notes
as permitted by the Indenture, including to facilitate the issuance and administration of Notes;
_provided, however, that (i) compliance with the this Indenture as so amended would not result in Notes_
being transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any other applicable securities law and (ii) such
amendment does not adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer Notes in any material respect;

(11) comply with the rules of any applicable securities depositary;

(12) facilitate any transaction that complies with the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” and “—Merger and Consolidation”, relating to_
mergers, consolidations and sales of assets; and

(13) comply with the covenant described under “—Certain _Covenants—Additional_ _Intercreditor_
_Agreements”._

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of, or actions taken in compliance with, the
covenants described under “—Certain Covenants” or this section shall be deemed to impair or affect any rights
of Holders to receive payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on the Notes.

In formulating its decisions on such matters, the Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, shall be
entitled to require and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including Officer’s Certificates
and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment, supplement or waiver of any Note Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the
substance thereof. A consent to any amendment, supplement or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder given
in connection with a sale or tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such sale or tender.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the paragraphs above, in order to effect an amendment
authorized by clauses (3) and (6) of the third paragraph of this section to add a Guarantor under the Indenture, it
shall only be necessary for the supplemental indenture providing for the accession of such additional Guarantor
to be duly authorized and executed by (i) the Issuer, (ii) such additional Guarantor and (iii) the Trustee. Any
other amendments permitted by the Indenture need only be duly authorized and executed by the Issuer, the
Trustee and the Security Agent (to the extent applicable).

The Indenture will not contain a covenant regulating the offer and/or payment of a consent fee to Holders.

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of Notes have concurred in any
direction, waiver or consent, Notes owned by the Issuer, or by any Person directly or indirectly controlling or
controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer, will be considered as though not
outstanding, except that for the purposes of determining whether the Trustee will be protected in relying on any
such direction, waiver or consent, only Notes that a responsible officer of the Trustee actually knows are so
owned will be so disregarded. For the avoidance of doubt, any Independent Debt Fund shall not be considered to
be a Person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the
Issuer.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of Topco, the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Note
Documents (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain
obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and
indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning
issuing temporary Notes, registrations of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of
an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the
Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the Transaction Security Documents and the rights of the Trustee and
the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time
will terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate the obligations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries under the
covenants described under “—Certain Covenants” and “—Merger and Consolidation” (other than clauses (i), (iii)
and (iv) of “—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer”) and “—Change of Control” and the default provisions
relating to such covenants described under “—Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross-default upon a
payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions (other than with respect to the
Issuer), the judgment default provision, the guarantee provision, and the security default provision described
under “—Events of Default” above (“covenant defeasance”).

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior
exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the
Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. If the Issuer exercises its
covenant defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an
Event of Default specified in clause (c), (d), (e) (other than with respect only to the Issuer), (f) or (g) under
“—Events of Default” above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer (i) must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance
_trust”) with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for this purpose) (a)_
for the benefit of the Holders of the Euro Notes, cash in euro or European Government Obligations or a
combination thereof; and (b) for the benefit of the Dollar Notes, cash in U.S. dollars or U.S. Government
Securities or a combination thereof, for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to
redemption or maturity, as the case may be; provided, that upon any redemption that requires the payment of the
Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the extent that an
amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of
redemption, with any deficit as of the date of redemption (any such amount, the “Applicable Premium Deficit”)
only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the date of redemption. Any Applicable Premium
Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee simultaneously with the deposit of
such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit shall be applied toward
such redemption, and (ii) must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, to the effect that Holders and
beneficial owners will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a
result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same
amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and
defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel must
be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or change in applicable U.S. federal income
tax law since the issuance of the Notes);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating,
hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer; and

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or
relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Transaction Security Documents, will be discharged and cease to be
of further effect (except as to surviving rights of transfer or exchange of the Notes and rights of the Trustee, as
expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all Notes when (1) either (a) all the Notes previously authenticated

250


-----

and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes and certain Notes for which provision for
payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to
the Trustee for cancellation; or (b) all Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have
become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to
be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice
of redemption by the Trustee or the Paying Agent in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has
deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the
Trustee for this purpose), (i) for the benefit of the Holders of the Euro Notes, money in euro or European
Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, and (ii) for the benefit of the Holders of the Dollar Notes,
money in U.S. dollars or U.S. Government Securities or a combination thereof, as applicable, in an amount
sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of deposit
(in the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case
may be; provided that upon any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount
deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of satisfying and discharging the Indenture to the extent that an amount
is deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of
redemption, with any Applicable Premium Deficit only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to
the date of redemption, and any Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate
delivered to the Trustee simultaneously with the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that
such Applicable Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be
paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; (4) the Issuer have delivered irrevocable instructions to the
Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the
redemption date, as the case may be; and (5) the Issuer have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and
an Opinion of Counsel each stating that all conditions precedent under the “—Satisfaction and Discharge”
section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with;
_provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to_
compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4)).

If requested in writing by the Issuer to the Trustee and the Paying Agent, the Trustee will distribute any
amounts deposited to the Holders prior to Stated Maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be; provided,
_however, that the Holders shall have received at least five Business Days’ notice from the Issuer of such earlier_
repayment date (which may be included in the notice of redemption). For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution
and payment to Holders prior to the maturity or redemption date as set forth above will not include any negative
interest, present value adjustment, break costs or any other premium on such amounts.

**Security Representative**

Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the execution of the Indenture and the issuance and purchase of the
Notes on the Issue Date shall be deemed to constitute the authorization and agreement on behalf of the Holders of
the initial appointment as of the Issue Date of GLAS Trust Corporation Limited, as representative
(rappresentante) pursuant to Article 2414 bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code (the “Security
_Representative”) in order to create and grant in its favor security interests and guarantees securing and_
guaranteeing the Notes and entitle it to exercise in the name and on behalf of the Holders all their rights
(including any rights before any court and judicial proceedings) relating to such security interests and guarantees.
Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, each Holder from time to time, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to
have agreed to, and accepted, the appointment of GLAS Trust Corporation Limited, as Security Representative.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer under the Note Documents or for any
claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note
waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the
Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the
view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee**

U.S. Bank Trustees Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will provide
that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has

251


-----

written notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in such Indenture. During the
existence of an Event of Default, of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the
Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of
care that a prudent person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or
refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.
Furthermore, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at
the request of any Holder, unless such Holder has offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to
the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the
Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any
such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee or any Agent will be permitted to engage in other transactions
with the Issuer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced. Such
terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Issuer and
(2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has actual knowledge that it has or has acquired a conflict of interest that is
not eliminated or (b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer
may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six months may
petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by
the successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, taxes and
expenses incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or in connection with
the acceptance or administration of the Indenture. In formulating its decisions, the Trustee and the Security
Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to require and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate,
including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

**Notices**

If and for so long as Notes are listed on the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules of the Authority
so require, notices of the Issuer with respect to the Notes will be sent to the Authority.

All notices to Holders of Notes will be validly given if electronically delivered or mailed to them at their
respective addresses in the register of the Holders, if any, maintained by the registrar. For so long as any Notes
are represented by global notes, all notices to Holders will be delivered to the Relevant Clearing Systems in
accordance with the applicable procedures of the Relevant Clearing Systems, delivery of which shall be deemed
to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph, which will give such notices to the Holders of book-entry interests.
To the extent the mandatory rules and procedures of the Relevant Clearing Systems conflict with any such
requirements, a notice will be deemed to satisfy the requirements of the Indenture if it complies with the
mandatory rules and procedures of the Relevant Clearing Systems.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more
than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are mailed,
such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after being so
mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or
other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed.
Failure to electronically deliver or mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect
its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is electronically delivered or mailed in
the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it. If a notice or
communication is given through a Relevant Clearing System, it is duly given on the day the notice is given to
such Relevant Clearing System.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, premium, if any, or Additional
Amounts, if any, on the Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment thereof.
Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed six years
after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

252

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions**

Euro, with respect to the Euro Notes, and U.S. dollars, with respect to the Dollar Notes, are the required
currencies (each, a “Required Currency”) of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the
Guarantors, if any, under or in connection with the Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof, if any, including
damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than the applicable Required Currency, whether
as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or
dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder, any Paying Agent or by the Trustee, in
respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the
Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the amount of the applicable Required Currency which
the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of
that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it
is practicable to do so). If the amount of the applicable Required Currency is less than the amount of the
Required Currency expressed to be due to the recipient, any Paying Agent or the Trustee under any Note, the
Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or the Trustee as a
result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient, any Paying Agent or the Trustee
on a joint and several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency
indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Note or any
Paying Agent or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources of
information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and
independent obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a separate and
independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Note, any Paying
Agent or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and
effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under
any Note or any Note Guarantee, or to the Trustee. Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes
of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent amount for
purposes hereof that is denominated in a non-euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency
exchange rate in effect on the date such non-euro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Listing**

Application will be made to list the Notes on the Exchange and for permission to be granted to deal in the
Notes on the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the application to list the Notes on the Exchange will be
approved or that permission to deal in the Notes thereon will be granted, and settlement of the Notes is not
conditioned on obtaining this listing or permission.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since a material portion of the assets of the Issuer and its subsidiaries are located outside the United States,
any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or the Guarantors, including judgments with
respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and
any purchase price with respect to the Notes, may not be collectable within the United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and the
Notes, the Issuer and the Guarantors will in the Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and
state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City, County and State of New York, in the United States of
America. The Indenture will provide that each of the Issuer and the Guarantors will appoint an agent for service
of process in any suit, action or proceeding with respect to the Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees
brought in any U.S. federal or New York state court located in the City of New York.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture and the Notes, including any Note Guarantees, and the rights and duties of the parties
thereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. For the
avoidance of doubt, the governing law of the Indenture and the Notes may be amended with the consent of
Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes). The Intercreditor Agreement and the
rights and duties of the parties thereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
England and Wales. The Transaction Security Documents will be governed by the law of the location of the
relevant asset that is part of the Charged Property.

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

Each series of Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A
will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
“Rule 144A Global Notes”). On the Issue Date, the Rule 144A Global Notes representing the USD Notes (the
“USD Rule 144A Global Notes”) will be deposited upon issuance with the custodian for DTC and registered in
the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC. On the Issue Date, the Rule 144A Global Note representing the
EUR Notes (the “EUR Rule 144A Global Notes”) will be deposited upon issuance with a common depositary
and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream.

Each series of Notes sold outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance
on Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered
form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes”). On the Issue Date, the Regulation S
Global Notes representing the USD Notes (the “USD Regulation S Global Note”) will be deposited upon
issuance with the custodian for DTC and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC. On the Issue
Date, the Regulation S Global Notes representing the EUR Notes (the “EUR Regulation S Global Note”) will be
deposited upon issuance with a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common
depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream. The Regulation S Global Notes and the Rule 144A
Global Notes are collectively referred to herein as the “Global Notes.”

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) and ownership of
interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the 144A
Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with DTC, in the
case of the Global Notes representing the USD Notes (the “USD Global Notes”), and Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, in the case of the Global Notes representing the EUR Notes (the “EUR Global Notes”), or persons
that may hold interests through such participants. Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof
will be effected only through, records maintained in book-entry form by DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream
and their participants. The Book-Entry Interests in Global Notes will only be issued in minimum denominations
of $200,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof (in the case of the USD Global Notes) and
minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof (in the case of the
EUR Global Notes).

The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
as applicable, will credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant’s account
with the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states
of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in
definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests.
In addition, while the Notes are in global form, owners of interests in the Global Notes will not have the Notes
registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form (subject to very
limited exceptions) and will not be considered the registered owners or “Holder” of the Notes under the Indenture
for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the custodian for DTC or common depositary for Euroclear
and/or Clearstream, as applicable (or its respective nominee), will be considered the holder of the Notes for all
purposes under the Indenture. As such, participants must rely on the procedures of DTC or Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of DTC or Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable, and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests in order to exercise
any rights of holders of the Notes under the Indenture.

None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrars, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agents nor any of their
respective agents will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry
Interests.

**Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive Notes in
registered form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”):

(1) if DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as
depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days;

306


-----

(2) if DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream so requests following an Event of Default (as defined under
“Description of the Notes”) under the Indenture; or

(3) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through DTC,
Euroclear or Clearstream following an Event of Default under the Indenture.

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest
described in the immediately preceding clause (3), their current procedure is to request that we issue or cause to
be issued, Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests.

In such an event, the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and
issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from
participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes
will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the Indenture, unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or
applicable law.

In the case of the issue of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may
transfer such Definitive Registered Note by surrendering it to the Registrar. In the event of a partial transfer or a
partial redemption of one Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the
transferee in respect of the part transferred, and a new Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferor
or the holder, as applicable, in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed; provided that a
Definitive Registered Note will only be issued in denominations of $200,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000
in excess thereof (in the case of a Definitive Registered Note relating to the USD Notes) and minimum
denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof (in the case of a Definitive
Registered Note relating to the EUR Notes).

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Notes
have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated and are
surrendered to the applicable Registrar or at the office of the applicable Transfer Agent, we will issue and the
Trustee or an authenticating agent appointed by the Trustee will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered
Note if the Trustee’s and our requirements are met. We or the Trustee may require a holder requesting
replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both the
Trustee and us to protect us, the Trustee and the applicable Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the Indenture
from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. We and/or the Trustee
may charge for expenses in replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to
become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by us pursuant to the provisions of the
Indenture, we in our discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or
purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests only in accordance
with the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the applicable Transfer Agent a
written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the
transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

To the extent permitted by law, we, the Trustee, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agents, the Registrars and
any of their respective agents shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute
owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global
Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time at the registered office of the Issuer, and such
registration is a means of evidencing title to the Notes.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the Book-Entry
Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in DTC or
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, will distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the holders of
the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such
Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will

307


-----

be equal to the amount received by DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the
redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer understands that under existing practices of
DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and/or
Clearstream or DTC, as applicable, will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis
(with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate in
accordance with their respective operational procedures; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less
than $200,000 principal amount (in the case of the USD Global Notes) and €100,000 principal amount (in the
case of the EUR Global Notes) at maturity may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

Payments of amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, interest,
additional interest and additional amounts) will be made by the Issuer to the applicable Paying Agent. The
applicable Paying Agent will, in turn, make such payments to DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, which will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their respective procedures.

Under the terms of the Indenture governing the Notes, the Issuer, the Trustee, each Paying Agent, each
Transfer Agent, each Registrar and any of their respective agents will treat the registered holder of the Global
Notes (for example, DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or their respective nominees) as the
owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer,
the Trustee, the Registrars, the Transfer Agents, the Paying Agents nor any of their respective agents has or will
have any responsibility or liability for:

   - any aspects of the records of DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or
indirect participant relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest, for any such
payments made by DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or indirect
participant, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of DTC or Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on
account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

   - payments made by DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or indirect
participant, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of DTC or Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or indirect participant relating to or payments made on
account of a Book-Entry Interest;

   - DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or indirect participant; or

   - the records of the custodian or common depositary, as applicable.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility
of such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of subscribers registered in “street
name.”

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any regulations of
the applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Initial Purchasers, the
Paying Agents, the Transfer Agents, the Registrars nor any of their respective agents will be liable to any holder
of a Global Note or any other person for any commissions, costs, losses or expenses in relation to or resulting
from any currency conversion or rounding effected in connection with any such payment. Holders may be subject
to foreign exchange risks that may have economic and tax consequences to them.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the USD
Global Notes will be paid to holders of interests in such Notes through DTC in U.S. dollars. The principal of,
premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the EUR Global Notes will be paid
to holders of interests in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in euro.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken
by a holder of the Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry
Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of
the Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. DTC, Euroclear and

308


-----

Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action
in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an Event of Default under the Notes, each of DTC, Euroclear
and Clearstream reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes in certificated
form, and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to their respective participants.

**Transfers**

Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Notes described herein, transfers
between participants in DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, will be done in accordance with DTC,
Euroclear and Clearstream rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder requires physical
delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell the Notes to persons in states which
require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder must transfer its interest in
the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream and in
accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Notice to Investors.” Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfer discussed in “Notice to Investors.”

Beneficial interests in a 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of
a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note denominated in the same currency only upon receipt by the
Trustee of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) from the transferor to the effect that such
transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 or any other exemption (if available under
the Securities Act). Through and including the 40th day after the later of the commencement of the offering of
the Notes and the closing of the Offering (the “distribution compliance period”), Regulation S Book-Entry
Interests will be limited to persons that have accounts with DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or persons who hold
interests through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, and any sale or transfer of such interest to U.S. persons shall
not be permitted during such period unless such resale or transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A under the
Securities Act. Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to (i) a person who takes delivery in the
form of 144A Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably
believes is a qualified institutional buyer within the meaning of Rule 144A under the Securities Act in a
transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A under the Securities Act or (ii) otherwise in accordance with
the transfer restrictions described under “Notice to Investors” and in accordance with any applicable securities
laws of any other jurisdiction.

Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in “Notice to Investors,” Book-Entry Interests may be transferred
and exchanged as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange.” Any Book-Entry Interest
in one of the Global Notes of any series that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a BookEntry Interest in the other Global Note of such series will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the
first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note, and accordingly, will
thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
such other Global Note for as long as it retains such a Book-Entry Interest.

In connection with transfers involving exchanges between Regulation S Book-Entry Interests and 144A
Book-Entry Interests, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the
relevant Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the other relevant Global Note.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note
only as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only if the
transferor first delivers to the Trustee and the Registrar a written certificate (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such
notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

**Information Concerning DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures
solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled
by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee,
the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agents, the Registrars nor any of their respective agents are responsible for those
operations or procedures.

309

DTC advised the Issuer that it is a limited purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking
Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal
Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a
“clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the U.S. Exchange Act. DTC holds and
provides asset servicing for issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity issues, corporate and municipal debt issues, and
money market instruments (that DTC’s direct participants deposit with DTC). DTC also facilitates the post trade
settlement among direct participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities, through
electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between direct participants’ accounts. DTC is a wholly
owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company for
DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are
registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system
is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies,
and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant, either
directly or indirectly.

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations and also facilitate the clearance
and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry
changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their
participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of
internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear
and Clearstream participants are financial institutions, such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks,
trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to
others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship
with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to
persons or entities that do not participate in the DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions
in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some
jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the
ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests
through the DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A
Global Notes only through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed and admitted to trading on the Official
List of the Exchange. Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in DTC, Euroclear or
Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective system’s rules and operating
procedures.

Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream will be
effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective system’s rules and operating procedures.

Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable,
they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be
discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the
Transfer Agents, the Registrars, the Paying Agents nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility
for the performance by DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants of their
respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the USD Notes will be made in U.S. dollars and initial settlement for the EUR Notes
will be made in euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow
the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be
credited to the securities custody accounts of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the Business Day
following the settlement date against payment for value on the settlement date.

310


-----

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in
same day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of
trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure
that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**Special Timing Considerations**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving the Notes through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems are
open for business.

Republic of Finland or by any municipality or other political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein.

Notes, if it is required to do so under Finnish law.

Payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer to corporates resident in Finland for tax purposes may be made
without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or
governmental charges of whatever nature imposed or levied by or on behalf of the Republic of Finland or by any
municipality or other political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein. Interest and any similar
payments made to corporates residing in Finland as well as any capital gain received by such corporations from
disposal of the Notes are taxable income. Current applicable tax rate is 20%.

_Individuals and Estates_

Interest and any similar payments (e.g. interest compensation or jälkimarkkinahyvitys and index
compensation or indeksihyvitys) made to individuals or estates residing in Finland are generally subject to
advance withholding of income tax (ennakonpidätys) and are taxable capital income of the receiver. Payments
classified as capital gain for Finnish income tax purposes are not subject to advance withholding of income tax

but are taxable capital income of the seller. Capital income is taxable at rate of 30% and at rate of 34% for the
amount of capital income exceeding €30,000 in the tax year in question.

The withholding liability should primarily lie with a possible paying agent or other intermediary (such as a
financial institution) effecting the payment to the holder of Notes, if the paying agent or intermediary is resident
in Finland for tax purposes or the payment is made through a Finnish permanent establishment of a non-resident
paying agent or intermediary.

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following discussion is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the Notes, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects.
The summary is limited to consequences relevant to a U.S. Holder (as defined below), except for the discussions
below under “—Additional Notes” and “—Foreign Account Tax Compliance,” and does not address the effects of
any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state,
local or non U.S. tax laws.

This discussion is based upon the tax laws of the United States, including the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations issued thereunder, and judicial and administrative
interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change at any time,
possibly with retroactive effect which could significantly affect the U.S. federal tax consequences described
below. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) have been or are expected to be sought with
respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will not take a different
position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes than those
discussed herein or that any such position would not be sustained in the event of litigation. A different treatment
than that assumed below could adversely affect the amount, timing and character of income, gain or loss in
respect of an investment in the Notes.

This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a
U.S. Holder in light of such U.S. Holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the unearned income
Medicare contribution tax, the alternative minimum tax, or the base erosion and anti-abuse tax, or to holders
subject to special rules, such as banks, broker-dealers, mutual funds, certain financial institutions, U.S.
expatriates, insurance companies, individual retirement and other tax deferred accounts, dealers in securities or
currencies, traders in securities, U.S. Holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax exempt
entities, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships, S corporations, or other pass
through entities and investors in such entities, entities covered by the U.S. anti-inversion rules, persons holding
the Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion transaction” or other integrated transaction, and persons
subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into
account in an “applicable financial statement” (as defined in Section 451 of the Code), and this discussion does
not address any state or local tax consequences. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who purchase
the Notes for cash at original issue and at their “issue price” (i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount of
the Notes is sold to investors for cash, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations
acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and who hold the Notes as capital assets
(generally, property held for investment) within the meaning of section 1221 of the Code.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation (or any
other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in the United
States or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) an estate the
income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) a trust if it is subject to
the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more “United States persons” (as defined
in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if the
trust has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a “United States person”
(as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code).

If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes,
the U.S. tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the
activities of the partnership. A partnership considering an investment in the Notes, and partners in such a
partnership, should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes.

313


-----

The summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations set forth below is for general information
purposes only. Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax
consequences of holding Notes in light of their particular circumstances, including the application of the U.S.
federal income tax considerations discussed below, as well as the application of other federal, state, local, foreign
or other tax laws.

**_IPO Debt Pushdown_**

Under certain circumstances, we may undertake an IPO Debt Pushdown (as described under “Description of
_the Notes—IPO Debt Pushdown”), pursuant to which the Issuer is entitled to give notice that the terms of the_
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) shall operate (with effect
from the date specified in the relevant Pushdown Notice) on the basis that references to the Issuer and Restricted
Subsidiaries (and all related provisions) shall apply only to the IPO Debt Pushdown Entity and its Subsidiaries
which are Restricted Subsidiaries. Such a modification to the terms of the Notes could be treated for U.S. federal
income tax purposes as a deemed exchange of (i) the Notes as in place prior to such modifications for (ii) new
Notes as in place after such modifications (“New Notes”). If such modifications resulted in a deemed exchange,
such a deemed exchange could be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes in which
certain beneficial owners of the Notes could be required to recognize gain or loss. The amount of any gain or loss
recognized upon such a deemed exchange of a Note for a New Note would be determined by reference to the
“issue price” of the New Note. The issue price of a New Note will equal the fair market value of such Note or
such New Note at the time of the deemed exchange if such Note or such New Note were considered “publicly
traded” for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the IPO Debt Pushdown is treated as a taxable transaction for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. Holder’s holding period in a New Note treated as received in the IPO
Debt Pushdown generally will commence on the day after the IPO Debt Pushdown, and tax basis in such New
Note would generally equal the issue price of such New Note. Generally, any gain or loss recognized as a result
of such deemed exchange will be taxed under the rules described under “—Sale, Exchange, Retirement,
_Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes.” If the issue price of such New Note is less than its stated_
redemption price at maturity by more than a de minimis amount, such New Note will be treated as issued with
original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such event, U.S. Holders would be required to
include such original issue discount in their income (as ordinary income) as it accrues, in advance of the receipt
of cash corresponding to such income on the Notes. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the
U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to modification of the Notes in connection with the IPO Debt
Pushdown, including the U.S. federal income tax considerations of a deemed exchange and resulting original
issue discount, if any.

**_Additional Payments_**

In certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to pay additional amounts if certain taxes are withheld
or deducted from payments on the Notes (as described under “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes”) or
make payments in redemption of the Notes in addition to their stated principal amount and accrued interest (as
described under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the Notes—Optional
_Redemption”). If any such payment is treated as a contingent payment, subject to certain exceptions, the Notes_
may be treated as foreign currency contingent payment debt instruments, in which case the timing and amount of
income inclusions and the character of income recognized may be different from the consequences discussed
herein. Although the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the possibility of paying
such additional amounts or making additional payments in redemption of the Notes does not result in the Notes
being treated as “contingent payment debt instruments” under the applicable Treasury regulations. This position
will be based in part on our determination that, as of the date of the issuance of the Notes, the possibility that
additional amounts will have to be paid, or additional payments in redemption of the Notes will have to be made,
is a remote or incidental contingency within the meaning of the applicable Treasury regulations.

Our determination that the Notes are not contingent payment debt instruments is binding on a U.S. Holder,
unless the U.S. Holder explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year during which such U.S. Holder
acquires the Notes that it is taking a different position. However, our position is not binding on the IRS. If the
IRS takes a contrary position to that described above, a U.S. Holder may be required to accrue interest income on
its Notes based upon a comparable yield, regardless of its method of accounting. The “comparable yield” is the
yield at which we would issue a fixed rate debt instrument with no contingent payments, but with terms and
conditions otherwise similar to those of the Notes, and may exceed the stated interest rate. In addition, any gain
on the sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition of the Notes would generally be recharacterized as

314


-----

ordinary income. Each U.S. Holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of the
Notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the
Notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments.

**_Payments of Stated Interest_**

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, the gross amount of stated interest on a Note will
generally be taxable to you as ordinary income at the time it is paid or accrued in accordance with your method
of accounting for tax purposes. In addition to interest on the Notes (which includes any foreign tax withheld),
you will be required to include in income any additional amounts paid in respect of any foreign tax withheld.

If you use the cash basis method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, you will be required to
include in income the U.S. dollar value of the stated interest received, determined by translating the foreign
currency received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received regardless of whether the payment is in
fact converted into U.S. dollars. You will not recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such
payment, but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the foreign currency so
received.

If you use the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, you may determine the
amount of income recognized with respect to such stated interest in accordance with either of two methods.
Under the first method, you will be required to include in income for each taxable year the U.S. dollar value of
the stated interest that has accrued during such year, determined by translating such interest at the average rate of
exchange for the period or periods during which such interest accrued or, in the case of an accrual period that
spans two taxable years of a U.S. Holder, the part of the period within each taxable year. Under the second
method, you may elect to translate stated interest income at the spot rate on: (1) the last day of the accrual period;
(2) the last day of the portion of the accrual period within the applicable taxable year if the accrual period
straddles your taxable year; or (3) the date the stated interest payment is received if such date is within five
Business Days of the end of the accrual period. This election will apply to all debt obligations you hold from year
to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. You should consult your own tax advisor as to the
advisability of making the above election.

Whether or not such election is made, upon receipt of a stated interest payment on a Note (including, upon
the sale of a Note, the receipt of proceeds which include amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid interest
previously included in income), a U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income
tax purposes will recognize ordinary income or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S.
dollar value of such payment (determined by translating the foreign currency received at the spot rate on the date
such payment is received) and the U.S. dollar value of the stated interest income such U.S. Holder previously
included in income with respect to such payment. This exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary
income or loss, generally will be treated as U.S. source and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to
interest income or expense.

**_Foreign Tax Credit_**

Stated interest income (including any additional amounts) on a Note generally will constitute foreign source
income and generally will be considered “passive category income” in computing the foreign tax credit allowable
to U.S. Holders under U.S. federal income tax laws. There are significant limitations on a U.S. Holder’s ability to
claim foreign tax credits. The rules governing the calculation of foreign tax credits are complex and depend on a
U.S. Holder’s particular circumstances. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the creditability
or deductibility of any withholding taxes.

**_Sale, Exchange, Retirement, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes_**

Generally upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S.
Holder generally will recognize U.S. source gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount
realized upon such disposition (less any amount attributable to accrued but unpaid interest not previously
included in income, which will be taxable as such) and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note. If a
U.S. Holder receives foreign currency on such a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable
disposition of a Note, the amount realized generally will be based on the U.S. dollar value of such foreign
currency based on the spot rate on the date of disposition. In the case of a Note that is considered to be traded on
an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. Holder and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. Holder, will

315


-----

determine the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency by translating such amount at the spot rate on the
settlement date of the disposition. The special election available to accrual basis U.S. Holders in regard to the
sale or other disposition of Notes traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all
debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis
U.S. Holder that does not make the special election will recognize exchange gain or loss to the extent that there
are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss
generally will constitute U.S. source ordinary income or loss.

A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will, in general, be the amount paid for such Note by such U.S.
Holder. If a U.S. Holder uses foreign currency to purchase a Note, the amount paid for the Note generally will be
the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price determined at the spot rate on the date of purchase,
decreased by, if applicable, the amount of amortizable bond premium previously amortized by such U.S. Holder
with respect to such Note and the amount of any payments made on such Note (other than payments of stated
interest). In the case of a Note that is considered to be traded on an established securities market, a cash basis
U.S. Holder and, if it makes the special election described in the preceding paragraph, an accrual basis U.S.
Holder, will determine the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price at the spot rate on the
settlement date of the purchase.

Any gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of
a Note generally will be U.S. source capital gain or loss and, except as discussed below with respect to foreign
currency gain or loss, generally will be long term capital gain or loss so long as the U.S. Holder has held the Note
for more than one year on the date of disposition. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. Holders
(including individuals) are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is
subject to limitations.

Gain or loss realized upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the
Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of such
Note generally will be treated as U.S. source income or as an offset to U.S. source income, respectively, and will
generally be treated as ordinary income or loss and not be treated as interest income or expense, including for
U.S. foreign tax credit limitation purposes. For these purposes, the “principal amount” of a Note is the U.S.
Holder’s foreign currency purchase price of the Note. Gain or loss attributable to fluctuations in currency
exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of such Note generally will equal the difference, if any,
between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount of the Note, determined at the spot rate on the date the
U.S. Holder disposes of the Note and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount of the Note, determined at
the spot rate on the date the U.S. Holder purchased such Note. In addition, upon the sale, exchange, redemption,
retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder may realize exchange gain or loss attributable to
amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest, which will be treated as discussed above
under “—Payments of Stated Interest.” However, upon a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable
disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder will realize any foreign currency exchange gain or loss (including with
respect to principal amount and accrued and unpaid stated interest) only to the extent of total gain or loss realized
by such U.S. Holder on such disposition.

**_Additional Notes_**

The Issuer may issue Additional Notes as described under “Description of the Notes—Additional Notes.”
These Additional Notes, even if they are treated for non-tax purposes as part of the same series as the original
Notes, in some cases may be treated as a separate series for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such case, the
Additional Notes may be considered to have original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes or be
subject to the contingent payment debt instrument rules which may affect the market value of the original Notes
if the Additional Notes are not otherwise distinguishable from the original Notes. If any Additional Notes are not
fungible with the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such Additional Notes will not have the same
CUSIP number as the original Notes. Any lack of fungibility of Additional Notes with the original Notes may
adversely affect the liquidity of any Additional Notes and cause such Additional Notes to trade at different prices
than the original Notes. U.S. Holders are urged to consult with their tax advisors regarding the potential issuance
of Additional Notes that are not fungible with the applicable series of initial Notes issued under the Indenture for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, but which nevertheless are not capable of being separately identified.

**_Tax Return Disclosure Requirements_**

Treasury regulations issued under the Code meant to require the reporting to the IRS of certain tax shelter
transactions cover certain transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters, including certain foreign currency
transactions giving rise to losses in excess of a certain minimum amount (e.g., $50,000 in the case of an
individual or trust), such as the receipt or accrual of interest or a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable
disposition of a foreign currency note or foreign currency received in respect of a foreign currency note. U.S.
Holders should consult their tax advisors to determine the tax return disclosure obligations, if any, with respect to
an investment in the Notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure
Statement).

Individuals and certain entities that own “specified foreign financial assets” (as defined in Section 6038D of
the Code) with an aggregate value exceeding certain threshold amounts (including certain amounts at any time
during the tax year), generally are required to file an information report with respect to such assets with their tax
returns. The Notes generally will constitute specified foreign financial assets subject to these reporting
requirements, unless the Notes are held in an account at certain financial institutions.

U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing disclosure
requirements to their ownership and disposition of the Notes, including the significant penalties for
non-compliance.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of principal and stated interest on the
Notes and to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of a Note paid to
a U.S. Holder unless such U.S. Holder is an exempt recipient (such as a corporation), and, when required,
provides evidence of such exemption. The payor (which may be us or an intermediate payor) will be required to
impose backup withholding, currently at a rate of 24%, on such payments if (1) the U.S. Holder fails to furnish
an accurate taxpayer identification number or to establish an exemption from backup withholding; (2) the IRS
notifies the payor that the taxpayer identification number furnished by the U.S. Holder is incorrect; (3) there has
been a “notified payee underreporting” described in section 3406(c) of the Code; or (4) the U.S. Holder has not
certified under penalties of perjury that it has furnished a correct taxpayer identification number, that it is a
“United States person”, (as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) and that the IRS has not notified such
U.S. Holder that it is subject to backup withholding under the Code. Backup withholding is not an additional tax
and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a
U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability provided that the required information is timely furnished to the
IRS. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of the backup withholding
rules on their particular circumstances.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance_**

Pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (provisions commonly known as “FATCA”), a “foreign
financial institution” may be required to withhold U.S. tax on certain “foreign passthru payments” to the extent
such payments are treated as attributable to certain U.S. source payments. Under proposed Treasury regulations,
obligations issued on or prior to the date that is two years after the date on which applicable final Treasury
regulations defining “foreign passthru payments” are filed generally would be “grandfathered” unless such
obligations are materially modified more than six months after such date. As of the date of this Offering
Memorandum, applicable final Treasury regulations have not yet been filed. Accordingly, even if the Issuer is
treated as a foreign financial institution, FATCA would apply to payments on the Notes only if there is a
significant modification of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes after the expiration of this
grandfathering period. Non-U.S. governments have entered into, and others are expected to enter into,
intergovernmental agreements with the United States to implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules
described herein. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors on how these rules may apply to their
investment in the Notes. In the event any withholding under FATCA is imposed with respect to any payments on
the Notes, there generally will be no additional amounts payable to compensate for the withheld amount.

317

**Certain General Tax Considerations**

**_Payments by a Guarantor_**

If a Guarantor makes any payment in respect of the Notes, it is possible that such payments may be subject
to withholding tax at applicable rates, subject to such relief as may be available under the provisions of any
applicable double taxation treaty, or to any other exemption that may apply. It is not certain that such payments
by the Guarantor will be eligible for such exemptions.

**The proposed financial transactions tax may have a negative effect on holders of the Notes (“FTT”)**

On February 14, 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the “Commission’s Proposal”) for a
Directive for a common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal,
Slovenia and Slovakia (each, other than Estonia, a “Participating Member State”). However, following the
ECOFIN Council meeting of December 8, 2015, Estonia has since stated that it will not participate.

Under the Commission’s Proposal, the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and
outside of the Participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Notes where at
least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a Participating Member State. A
financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, “established” in a Participating Member State in a broad range
of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a Participating Member State or
(b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a Participating Member State.

Under the Commission’s Proposal, the FTT should be payable to the tax administration by each financial
institution and, where the FTT had not been duly paid, each party to the transaction, including persons other than
financial institutions, should be jointly and severally liable for the payment of the FTT. Therefore, the FTT might
increase the cost of the transactions for holders and beneficial owners of the Notes.

On October 28, 2016, the Council of the European Union published document No. 13608/16 concerning the
status of the FTT at that time, according to which a certain degree of progress in the FTT negotiations have been
observed. However, further work at the Council and its preparatory bodies will be required before a final
agreement can be reached among the participating Member States that respects the competences, rights and
obligations of the Member States not participating in the FTT. The ECOFIN Council indicated on December 6,
2016 and on June 12, 2017, that the ten Participating Member States agreed to pursue the on-going work and
discussions on the main features of the FTT before a final agreement can be reached.

The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between Participating Member States and the scope of any
such taxation is uncertain. Additional EU Member States may decide to participate and/or certain of the
Participating Member States may decide to withdraw.

Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Finland and U.S. Holdco is incorporated under the laws of the
United States. The entities that we currently expect to accede as Post Squeeze-Out Guarantors are incorporated or
organized under the laws of Finland, France, Italy and the United States. The documents relating to the Collateral
for the Notes will be governed by the laws of Finland, France, Italy and the United States. The Indenture
(including the Note Guarantees) and the Notes will be governed by New York law. The Intercreditor Agreement
is governed by English law. All of the directors and executive officers of the Issuer and each of the Guarantors,
except the Guarantors incorporated in the United States, are non-residents of the United States. Since most of the
assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors, and its and their directors and executive officers, are located outside the
United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or a Guarantor or any such other
non-U.S. resident person, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium (if any) and
interest on the Notes or any judgment of a U.S. court predicated upon civil liabilities under U.S. federal or state
securities laws, may not be collectible in the United States. Furthermore, although the Issuer and each of the
Guarantors located outside the United States will appoint an agent for service of process in the United States and
will submit to the jurisdiction of New York courts (in the case of any Post Squeeze-Out Guarantor, upon
accession), in each case, in connection with any action in relation to the Notes and the Indenture or under U.S.
securities laws, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process on us or on such other persons as
mentioned above within the United States in any action, including actions predicated upon the civil liability
provisions of U.S. federal securities laws. It may be possible for investors to effect service of process within
other jurisdictions upon those persons, the Issuer or the Guarantors provided that, for example, The Hague
Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of
November 15, 1965 is complied with.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Issuer or a Guarantor, investors will need to enforce
such judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company has assets. Even though the enforceability of U.S.
court judgments outside the United States is described below for the countries in which each of the Guarantors or
the Collateral is located, you should consult with your own advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to
enforce a judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the United States.

**Finland**

As there is no treaty on the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration
awards) in civil and commercial matters between the United States and Finland, courts in Finland will not
automatically recognize and enforce a final judgment rendered by a U.S. court. Under Finnish law, a Finnish title
for execution (i.e., a Finnish court judgment) is required for such recognition and enforcement; in seeking a
Finnish court judgment or order to such effect, a judgment of a U.S. court will constitute circumstantial evidence
of the questions of fact in the case concerned and evidence of the governing law as applied to the matter in
dispute. The application by a Finnish court of foreign law in a matter brought before it is subject to (a) the
foreign law not being contrary to such mandatory rules of Finnish law that due to their public nature or general
interest would be considered applicable irrespective of the agreed choice of law; and (b) the application of the
foreign law not resulting in an outcome contrary to the public policy (ordre public) of the Finnish legal system.

As to types of damages awarded, punitive or exemplary damages are unenforceable under Finnish law and a
Finnish court may only award damages to the extent that they form compensation for actual losses and damages
as proven by the claimant. A feature of the Finnish civil procedure is that the burden of proof with respect to any
claims presented lies with the claimant. A party to legal proceedings in Finland is also ordinarily expected to
plead its case primarily on the basis of the evidence in its own possession. U.S. notions of discovery, including
the expectation that broadly defined categories of documents and information in the possession of third parties
will be readily accessible for use as evidence, are not recognized under Finnish law. The availability of
documentation in the possession of counterparties or third parties is very limited. Depositions are also a form of
taking evidence unknown to Finnish law. In Finland, witness testimony is usually only taken at a separate oral
main hearing (comparable to a U.S. trial) after the preparatory phase of the proceedings.

Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or
moratorium as well as other similar mandatory laws affecting creditors’ rights generally.

319


-----

**France**

The following is a summary of certain legal aspects of French law regarding the enforcement of civil law
claims connected with the Notes against French entities and/or French individuals.

The United States and France are not parties to a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, a
judgment rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely
upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not directly be recognized or enforceable in France.

A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings (exequatur) in
France before the relevant civil court (tribunaux judiciaires) that has exclusive jurisdiction over such matter.

Enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non ex parte)
proceedings if such U.S. judgment is enforceable in the United States and if the French civil court is satisfied that
the following conditions have been met (which conditions, under prevailing French case law as of the date of this
Offering Memorandum, do not include a review by a French civil court of the merits of the foreign judgment):

   - such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter because the dispute is
clearly connected to the jurisdiction of such court (i.e., there was no international forum shopping), the
choice of the U.S. court was not fraudulent and the French courts did not have exclusive jurisdiction
over the matter;

   - such U.S. judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules (ordre public
_international), both pertaining to the merits and to the procedure of the case, including fundamental_
procedural rights; and

   - such U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud under French law.

In addition to these conditions, it is well established that only final and binding foreign judicial decisions
(i.e., those having a res judicata effect) can benefit from an exequatur under French law, that such U.S. judgment
should not conflict with a French judgment or a foreign judgment that has become effective in France, and there
is no proceedings pending before French courts at the time enforcement of the U.S. judgment is sought and
having the same or similar subject matter as such U.S. judgment.

If the French civil court is satisfied that such conditions are met, the U.S. judgment will benefit from the res
_judicata effect as of the date of the decision of the French civil court and will thus be declared enforceable in_
France. However, the decision granting the exequatur is subject to appeal.

In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely affected under
certain circumstances by French Law No. 68-678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by French Law No. 80-538 of
July 16, 1980 and French Ordinance No. 2000-916 of September 19, 2000 (relating to the communication of
documents and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign
authorities or persons) and French law No. 2018-670 of July 30, 2018 related to the protection of trade secrets, as
modified in particular by the French Law No. 2019-486 of May 22, 2019 and the French Law No. 2019-222 of
March 23, 2019, which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in France or from French persons in
connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action. Pursuant to the regulations above, the U.S. authorities
would have to comply with international (the 1970 Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad) or
French procedural rules to obtain evidence in France or from French persons.

Similarly, French data protection rules (Law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 on data processing, data files and
individual liberties, as modified by laws No. 2017-55 of January 20, 2017, No. 2018-493 of June 20, 2018,
No. 2018-699 of August 3, 2018, No. 2019-828 of August 6, 2019 and No. 2019-774 of July 24, 2019, French
Ordinance No. 2018-1125 of December 12, 2018 and the GDPR) can limit under certain circumstances the
possibility of obtaining information in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or
administrative U.S. action in a discovery context.

Furthermore, if an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply foreign law
designated by the applicable French rules of conflict (including the law chosen by the parties to govern their
contract) if the application of such law (in the case at hand) is deemed to contravene French international public
policy (as determined on a case-by-case basis by French courts). Furthermore, in an action brought in France on
the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all the
remedies sought.

Pursuant to Article 14 of the French Civil Code (Code civil), a French national (either a company or an
individual) can sue a foreign defendant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations
contracted by the foreign defendant in France with a French person or in a foreign country with French
individuals. Pursuant to Article 15 of the French Civil Code, a French national can be sued by a foreign claimant
before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the French national in a
foreign country with the foreign claimant. For a long time, case law has interpreted these provisions as meaning
that a French national, either claimant or defendant, could not be forced against its will to appear before a
jurisdiction other than French courts. However, according to case law, the French courts’ jurisdiction over French
nationals is not mandatory to the extent an action has been commenced before a court in a jurisdiction that has
sufficient contacts with the dispute and the choice of jurisdiction is not fraudulent. In addition, a French national
may waive their rights to benefit from the provisions of Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, including by
way of conduct by voluntarily appearing before the foreign court.

It must be noted that under Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council
of December 12, 2012, with respect to legal actions falling within the scope of said Regulation, the privileges
granted to French nationals pursuant to Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code may not be invoked against a
person domiciled in a Member State. Conversely, pursuant to Article 6.2 of Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012, the
privilege granted by Article 14 of the French Civil Code may be invoked by a claimant domiciled in France,
regardless of the claimant’s nationality, to sue before French courts a defendant domiciled outside the European
Union.

On several occasions (the latest being dated October 3, 2018), the Civil Chamber of the French Supreme
Court (Cour de Cassation) has held that a contractual provision submitting one party to the exclusive jurisdiction
of a court and giving another party the discretionary option to choose any competent jurisdiction was invalid on
the ground that it was discretionary (potestative). The Commercial Chamber of the French Supreme Court (Cour
_de Cassation) has held the contrary by a decision dated May 11, 2017. Accordingly, any provisions to the same_
effect in any relevant documents may not be binding on the party submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
court or prevent a French party from bringing an action before the French courts.

**Italy**

Recognition and enforcement in Italy of final judgments rendered by U.S. courts, including judgments
obtained in actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws, may
not require retrial and will be enforceable in Italy, provided that pursuant to Article 64 of Italian Law No. 218 of
31 May 1995 (Riforma del sistema italiano di diritto internazionale privato), amongst others, the following
conditions are met:

   - the U.S. court which rendered the final judgment had jurisdiction according to Italian law principles of
jurisdiction;

   - the relevant summons and complaint were appropriately served on the defendants in accordance with
U.S. law and during the proceedings the essential rights of the defendant have not been violated;

   - the parties to the proceeding appeared before the court in accordance with U.S. law or, in the event of
default by the defendant, the U.S. court declared such default in accordance with U.S. law;

   - the judgment is final and not subject to any further appeal in accordance with U.S. law;

   - there is no conflicting final judgment rendered by an Italian court;

   - there is no-action pending in Italy amongst the same parties for decision on the same matter which
commenced prior to the action in the United States; and

   - the provisions of such judgment of the U.S. court would not violate Italian public policy (ordine
_pubblico)._

In addition, pursuant to Article 67 of Italian Law No. 218 of 31 May 1995, if a judgment rendered by a U.S.
court is not complied with, its recognition is challenged or its compulsory enforcement is necessary, then a
proceeding shall be initiated before the competent Court of Appeal in the Republic of Italy to that end. The
competent Court of Appeal does not consider the merits of the case but exclusively ascertains the fulfilment of all
the conditions set out above.

321


-----

In original actions brought before Italian courts, the enforceability of liabilities or remedies based solely on
the U.S. federal securities law is debatable. In addition, in original actions brought before Italian courts, Italian
courts may apply not only Italian rules of civil procedure, but also certain substantive provisions of Italian law
that are regarded as mandatory, and may refuse to apply U.S. law provisions or grant some of the remedies
sought (e.g., punitive damages) if their application violates any Italian public policies and/or any mandatory
provisions of Italian law.

**CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND**
**ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS**

_The following is a summary of certain insolvency law considerations in the jurisdictions in which the Issuer,_
_the Guarantors and certain subsidiaries are incorporated or organized, and a summary of certain limitations on_
_the validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the security interests for the Notes. The description is_
_only a summary and does not purport to be complete or to discuss all of the limitations or considerations that_
_may affect the validity and enforceability of the Notes and the Note Guarantees and the security interests._
_Prospective investors in the Notes should consult their own legal advisors with respect to such limitations and_
_considerations._

**European Union**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of a member state of the European
Union (each member state of the European Union, a “Member State”).

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on
insolvency proceedings (recast), replacing Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000 on
insolvency proceedings, as amended (as amended from time to time, the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), the court
which shall have jurisdiction to commence the main insolvency proceedings in relation to a company (subject to
certain exceptions) organized under the laws of a Member State is the court of the Member State (other than
Denmark) in which the relevant company’s “centre of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the
EU Insolvency Regulation, “COMI”) is situated. The determination of where any such company has its COMI is
a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have different and even conflicting
views.

COMI is not a static concept. Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU
Insolvency Regulation that any such company has its COMI in the Member State in which it has its registered
office. Recital 28 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the COMI of a debtor should correspond to the
place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which “is ascertainable
by third parties.” In that respect, factors such as where board meetings are held, the location where the company
conducts the majority of its business and the location where the large majority of the company’s creditors are
established may all be relevant in the determination of the place where the company has its COMI. A company’s
COMI may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have
competent jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation at the
time of the filing of the insolvency petition. The presumption described above shall however only apply if the
registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the three-month period prior to the request
for the opening of insolvency proceedings (as defined in Article (3) of the EU Insolvency Regulation).

If the COMI of a company is and will remain located in a Member State, the main insolvency proceedings
in respect of the company under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and
accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings
referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings initiated in one Member State
under the EU Insolvency Regulation are automatically recognized in the other Member States (other than
Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be initiated in another Member State in the event that the
company has an “establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency
Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State. An “establishment” is defined to mean “any place of
operations where a debtor carries on non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.”

Secondary proceedings are limited to winding-up proceedings and the effects of such secondary proceedings
are restricted to the assets of the company situated in the territory of such other Member State.

Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI have not yet been
commenced, pursuant to Article 3 (4) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, territorial insolvency proceedings may
only be commenced in another Member State where the debtor has an establishment where either (i) insolvency
proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s COMI is situated under that
Member State’s law or (ii) the opening of territorial insolvency proceedings is requested by (a) a creditor whose
claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the
Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested, or (b) a public authority that has the right
to request the opening of insolvency proceedings under the law of the Member State in which the establishment
is located. When main insolvency proceedings are opened, territorial insolvency proceedings become secondary

323


-----

insolvency proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary or territorial
insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori
_concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency_
proceedings of the debtor. Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the
Member State within the territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with its
Article 3 shall have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is
closely linked with them, such as avoidance actions.

The opening of insolvency proceedings in a Member State pursuant to Article 8 of the EU Insolvency
Regulation shall not affect the rights in rem of creditors or third parties in respect of tangible or intangible,
moveable or immoveable assets, both specific assets and collections of indefinite assets as a whole that change
from time to time, belonging to the debtor that are situated within the territory of another Member State at the
time of the opening of proceedings. Rights in rem include:

   - the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the proceeds of
or income from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a mortgage;

   - the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in respect of the claim
or by assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee;

   - the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or use of
them contrary to the wishes of the party so entitled;

   - a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets.

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court
commencing main proceedings that will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no
secondary proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in a
Member State that has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s COMI is located there)
may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (such as to
remove assets of the debtor from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations as long as no insolvency
proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State or no preservation measures have been taken to
the contrary further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the
debtor has assets.

Pursuant to Article 21 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency officeholder appointed by the court
of the main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of the Member State in which the
main proceedings are located in another Member State as long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in
such other Member State or any preservation measure to the contrary has been taken there further to a request to
open insolvency proceedings in such other Member State. He may, in particular, subject to the preservation of
third parties’ right in rem pursuant to Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation and to the preservation of the
sellers’ rights based on a reservation of title pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, remove
assets of the company from that other Member State.

However, under Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main
insolvency proceedings may attempt to avoid the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another
Member State by giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which
secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened that the distribution of those assets or of the proceeds
received as a result of their realization, will comply with the distribution and priority rights that would apply
under the relevant national law if secondary insolvency proceedings were opened in such other Member State.
Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a qualified majority of known local
creditors, determined in accordance with the local law of such other Member State. If approved, the undertaking
is binding on the insolvency estate and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it shall,
at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceedings
if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors.

Additionally, under Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual
enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and its
creditors, the court, at the request of the company or of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency
proceedings, may stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding three months,
provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local creditors.

324


-----

Under Article 46 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court that opened the secondary insolvency
proceedings will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part upon receipt of a request from
the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a period of up to three months, unless such a
request is manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency proceedings. Such stay may be
continued or renewed for similar periods. Where the court stays the process of realization of the assets, the court
may require the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure to
guarantee the interests of the creditors in the secondary insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of
creditors.

**_EU Directive on preventive restructuring frameworks_**

The EU directive 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and the Council of June 20, 2019 on preventive
restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency
of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU)
2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency) (the “EU Restructuring Directive”) was published on
June 26, 2019.

The objectives of the EU Restructuring Directive are to ensure that (i) viable enterprises and entrepreneurs
that are in financial difficulties have access to effective national preventive restructuring frameworks that enable
them to continue operating, (ii) honest insolvent or over-indebted entrepreneurs (i.e. individuals) can benefit
from a full discharge of debt after a reasonable period of time, thereby affording them a second chance and
(iii) the effectiveness of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt is improved, in
particular with a view to shortening their length.

The Restructuring Directive aims to achieve a higher degree of harmonization in the field of restructuring,
insolvency, discharge of debt and disqualifications by establishing substantive minimum standards for preventive
restructuring procedures as well as for procedures leading to a discharge of debt for entrepreneurs in order to
promote a culture that encourages early preventive restructuring to address financial difficulties at an early stage,
when it appears likely that insolvency can be prevented and the viability of the business can be ensured. Most
notably, the Restructuring Directive provides for a framework pursuant to which (a) a stay of individual
enforcement actions by creditors against debtors must be introduced by Member States national legislation,
(b) all creditor claims shall be grouped into separate classes each of which shall reflect a commonality of
interests (at a minimum, creditors of secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in separate classes), (c)
creditor claims may be restructured in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not more than 75%
of the amount of the claims in each class and, where the Member State so requires, a majority in number of
affected parties in each class and (d) a cross-class cram-down is introduced whereby a restructuring plan may,
under certain conditions, be adopted and bind dissenting creditors even if the creditors of one or more classes do
not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority. In order to be adopted the plan will have to be
confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority that will in particular ensure the protection of each type of
creditors’ rights and compliance with the priority rules governing the adoption of the plan. The transposition of
the Restructuring Directive into national legislation shall protect new financing and interim financing and may
also provide priority ranking to new or interim financing granted in the context of the restructuring.

The EU Restructuring Directive shall be transposed into national laws or regulations by Member States by
July 17, 2021 (with the exception of the provisions relating to the use of electronic means of communication for
which the time period for the transposition expires in certain respects on July 17, 2024 or, in others, on July 17,
2026), subject to a maximum 1 year extension of the transposition period for Member States encountering
particular difficulties in implementing the EU Restructuring Directive.

In the event that any one of the Issuer or Guarantors experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to
predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be
commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable laws may affect the enforceability of the
obligations and the security of the Issuer or Guarantors. The insolvency, administration and other laws of the
jurisdictions in which the respective companies are organized or operate may be materially different from, or
conflict with, each other and there is no assurance as to how the insolvency laws of the potentially involved
jurisdictions will be applied in relation to one another.

**Finland**

**_Applicable Insolvency Law_**

The Issuer and certain of the Issuer’s subsidiaries are incorporated and have their centre of main interests in
Finland. In the event of insolvency of a Finnish company, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Finland.
Such proceedings would be governed by Finnish law. In case of insolvency proceedings connected to another EU
member state within the meaning of regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council on
Insolvency Proceedings, and provided that said regulation is applied to such EU member state, the regulation
shall apply.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Finnish insolvency law.

The provisions of the Finnish Bankruptcy Act (Konkurssilaki, 120/2004, as amended) (the “Finnish
Bankruptcy Act”), the Finnish Restructuring Act (Laki yrityksen saneerauksesta, 47/1993, as amended) (the
“Finnish Restructuring Act”) and the Finnish Act on the Recovery of Assets to the Bankruptcy Estate (the
“Recovery Act”) (Laki takaisinsaannista konkurssipesään, 758/1991, as amended) are particularly relevant to
this discussion.

Under Finnish law, if a company is insolvent or is at risk of becoming insolvent, the company may be the
subject of two alternative types of proceedings: company restructuring (Finnish: yrityssaneeraus) and bankruptcy
(Finnish: konkurssi). Liquidation proceedings (Finnish: selvitystila) under the Companies Act (Osakeyhtiölaki,
624/2006, as amended) generally concern only solvent companies as there is an obligation to conclude
liquidation proceedings and file for bankruptcy if the full settlement of all of the company’s debts is not possible
in liquidation.

**_Company Restructuring_**

If a company is insolvent or is at risk of becoming insolvent, and it is probable that company restructuring
proceedings would remedy the insolvency or prevent its recurrence otherwise than temporarily, an application for
company restructuring can be submitted to a court by the debtor or by one or more creditors in accordance with
the Finnish Restructuring Act. Further, the initiation of company restructuring proceedings is possible—in
theory, irrespective of the company’s solvency situation—when at least two creditors whose total claims
represent at least one fifth of the debtor’s known debts and who are not related to the debtor file a joint
application with the debtor or declare that they support the debtor’s application for company restructuring.

If there are no specific barriers to restructuring under the Finnish Restructuring Act and, consequently, the
court approves the application and opens restructuring proceedings, the court will simultaneously appoint a
restructuring administrator (Finnish: selvittäjä). The purpose of a company restructuring is to investigate whether
the business has a reasonable chance to continue and, if so, to rehabilitate the company’s viable business, ensure
its continued viability and make debt arrangements with creditors and execute other measures. The Board of
Directors and the Managing Director continue to act on behalf of the company during the restructuring
proceedings. The restructuring administrator is entitled to review the company’s books and business documents
and obtain any information on the company’s business activities, as well as to participate in meetings of the
debtor’s corporate bodies. The restructuring administrator’s consent is required to certain legal acts of a
significant nature of the debtor company specified in the Finnish Restructuring Act.

The commencement of restructuring proceedings, as a general rule, has no effect on the debtor’s existing
contracts. However, there are some exceptions set forth in the Finnish Restructuring Act regarding premature
termination of certain contracts, such as lease agreements, unfulfilled contracts not deemed to be a regular part of
the activities of the debtor and employment relationships.

_Moratorium_

Subject to certain exceptions, all existing claims against the company that have arisen before the filing of
the restructuring application are suspended as of the commencement of the company restructuring. The
suspension prohibits the enforcement and placing of security, the repayment and enforcement of the restructuring
debts (although debts arising after the filing of the restructuring application must be repaid and can be enforced),
and the seizure of assets. The court may order, on the request of the applicant or the debtor, that such prohibitions
are in effect on an interim basis as of a date even prior to the commencement of restructuring proceedings (i.e.,
shortly after the filing of the application for the restructuring proceedings). The suspensions are in force until the
restructuring program has been verified by the district court or the proceedings have been, for reasons specified
in the Finnish Restructuring Act, dismissed or interrupted.

326


-----

Debts arising after the filing of the application must be repaid as they become due. The same applies to fees,
charges and other running expenses (e.g., lease payments) based on a continuous contractual relationship or on a
continuous contract on use or possession, to the extent as these relate to the period subsequent to the filing of the
application.

_Debt Arrangements_

Creditors with equal ranking have an equal status in the arrangements of the restructuring debts (i.e., debts
that have arisen before the filing of the application) within the restructuring program.

Subject to certain restrictions set forth in the Finnish Restructuring Act, the following measures may be
taken with respect to unsecured debts in the restructuring program: (i) changing the repayment schedule;
(ii) ordering that debt payments be considered as payments against principal first, and as payments of interest and
other credit costs only second; (iii) reducing the obligation to pay interest and other credit costs with respect to
the remaining term of a debt; and (iv) reducing the outstanding principal balance of unpaid debt. The
restructuring program may also include the full or partial refinancing of debt, either as a lump sum funded by the
issuance of new debt or with payments in lieu of performance that are considered reasonable having regard to the
creditor’s position and field of business.

Secured debt means restructuring debt where the creditor holds an effective (against third parties) security
interest to property that belongs to or is in the possession of the debtor, in so far as the value of the security at the
commencement of the proceedings would have been enough to cover the amount of the creditor’s claim after the
deduction of liquidation costs and claims with a higher priority. The part of the claim that is not covered by the
value of the security is regarded as unsecured debt for the purposes of the restructuring proceedings. Regarding
business mortgages, only 50% of the value of the mortgaged property will be considered as secured debt. The
value of the property will be determined by the restructuring program.

The following debt arrangements may be applied to secured debt: (i) changing the repayment schedule;
(ii) ordering that debt payments be applied as payments against principal first and as payments of interest and
other credit costs second; or (iii) reducing the obligation to pay interest and other credit costs with respect to the
remaining term of the debt. The restructuring program may also include the full or partial refinancing of secured
debt as a lump sum payment funded by the issuance of new debt.

Even if the debt arrangement does not affect the existence or content of a creditor’s security right, the
security arrangements relating to the debt may be altered by replacing the security with other fully adequate
security.

Payments on a secured debt shall be set so that at least the present value of the secured debt will be repaid
within a reasonable period, not to materially exceed the remainder of the credit period without the consent of the
creditor or, if the debt has become due in full, not to materially exceed half of the original credit period. As for
reducing interest and other credit costs, the length of the remaining credit period should be taken into
consideration in the restructuring program, so that the longer the remaining credit period, the smaller the
reduction in interest and credit costs.

_Approval of the Restructuring Program_

The draft of the restructuring program will be drawn up by the restructuring administrator, and the court will
ratify it subject to the approval of all the creditors or with the acceptance of the majority in the groups of
creditors. However, there are some specific limitations under the Finnish Restructuring Act which apply even if
the restructuring program is approved by all creditors or the majority in all groups of creditors. Furthermore,
even if the majority does not exist in one or several groups of creditors, the restructuring program may
nonetheless be approved at the request of the person who has prepared the draft, the administrator or the debtor,
subject to the terms specified in the Finnish Restructuring Act. In such a case the restructuring claims of the
creditors in favor of the program must represent at minimum one fifth of all restructuring claims of the debtor
company taken into consideration in the voting procedure in accordance with the Finnish Restructuring Act and
at least one group of creditors must have voted for approval of the program by majority. The debtor may also
submit a proposal to the court with respect to the restructuring program, which the court may consider in its
discretion.

**_Bankruptcy_**

A debtor or a qualifying creditor may apply for bankruptcy from a court of competent jurisdiction when the
debtor is unable to pay its debts and the inability to pay is not temporary, i.e. considered to be insolvent. If the

327


-----

application is approved, an estate administrator (or several estate administrators) (Finnish: pesänhoitaja) will be
appointed by the court.

A bankruptcy covers all the liabilities of the debtor, and its objective is to liquidate the assets of the debtor
and use the proceeds received in payment of the creditors’ claims. The bankruptcy estate may (in exceptional
situations) continue the company’s business operations and the disposal of property should be realized as soon as
it is reasonably possible. The debtor’s assets are, from the beginning of the bankruptcy, subject to the authority of
the estate administrator. The creditors are represented through the meeting of creditors. The estate administrator
must act for the common benefit of all creditors and shall comply with the decisions and guidelines of the
creditors in matters falling within the decision making powers of the creditors.

_Notice to the Bankruptcy Estate with regard to Claims_

As a main rule, in order to be entitled to a disbursement, a creditor must file a claim in bankruptcy in writing
with the estate administrator, by a deadline set by the estate administrator. Information concerning the deadline is
sent to all known creditors and published in local newspaper as well as in the official gazette of Finland (Finnish:
_Virallinen lehti). The obligation to notify the bankruptcy estate of a claim is binding even on a creditor with a_
secured claim. A creditor who holds assets belonging to the debtor as security for the debt of a third party must,
at the request of, and within a time limit set by, the estate administrator, provide the same information on the
receivables and collateral as should be provided in a claim letter. A creditor who holds a business mortgage over
the assets of the debtor, as referred to in the Finnish Business Mortgages Act (Yrityskiinnityslaki, 634/1984, as
amended), as security for a claim shall file the claim as provided in the Finnish Bankruptcy Act. If a claim is
denominated in a currency other than euro, the value in euro for the purposes of the bankruptcy proceedings is
determined using the exchange rate of the date of commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings.

A creditor who wishes to use his or her claim for set off against a debt owed to the debtor must, when giving
notice of the set off, provide the estate administrator with the same information that would be provided in a claim
letter.

_Disbursements_

The estate administrator draws up a list of how the proceeds of the estate are to be divided among the
creditors (“draft disbursement list”). The court verifies that the estate administrator’s disbursement list meets the
statutory requirements and that the procedural provisions relating to the draft disbursement list have been
observed.

The entitlement of creditors to payment out of the proceeds of the bankruptcy estate is proportionate to the
amount of their claims, unless otherwise provided by law. However, according to the Finnish Act on Order of
Payment of the Creditors (Laki velkojien maksusaantijärjestyksestä, 1572/1992, as amended), the following
creditors have priority over unsecured creditors in the following order: (i) creditors of secured claims (excluding
claims secured by business mortgage) and holders of retention rights, with priority over the proceeds from the
respective security asset; (ii) the administrative expenses of the bankruptcy estate, claims on the basis of
contracts that the bankruptcy estate (rather than the debtor) has entered into, any liabilities for which the
bankruptcy estate is responsible by operation of law and a debt that has arisen between the commencement and
discontinuation of restructuring proceedings; (iii) if the company has undergone restructuring proceedings before
the bankruptcy, (A) fees and expenses of the restructuring administrator with penal interest incurred until the
time of payment of the fees and expenses and (B) after satisfaction of payments in paragraph (A) above, creditors
of a debt that has arisen between the commencement and discontinuation of restructuring proceedings and
(iv) claims that are secured by a business mortgage will receive prior to other unsecured claims 50% of the value
of the mortgaged assets.

Under Finnish law, certain claims are settled after all other claims. In practice, the most significant of such
claims are the interest accruing on the claim during the period subsequent to the commencement of the
bankruptcy and a loan or a bond which pursuant to its terms is subordinated to ordinary debt. The Finnish state
has no preferential rights regarding taxes and other fiscal charges.

The assets of the bankruptcy estate are to be disposed of in the most advantageous manner so as to
maximize the aggregate net proceeds, including by way of auctions, through advertising and direct solicitation of
potential buyers. However, creditors that have an interest in collateral may exercise their right of liquidation of
collateral regardless of the bankruptcy proceedings. The bankruptcy estate may at its own discretion prohibit the
sale of pledged property for a maximum of two months. The bankruptcy estate may sell collateral belonging to

328


-----

the estate only if the creditor protected by the collateral consents to the same or if the court grants a specific
permission. At the request of the bankruptcy estate, assets of the bankruptcy estate may also be sold in
accordance with the provisions of the Finnish Enforcement Code (Ulosottokaari, 705/2007, as amended) (the
“Finnish Enforcement Code”) if the bailiff consents to the same.

**_Recovery of Assets_**

Pursuant to the Recovery Act certain acts carried out by a debtor can be revoked if the rights of creditors
have been prejudiced by those acts. According to the Finnish Restructuring Act and the Finnish Enforcement
Code, the grounds for recovery set forth in the Recovery Act are also to be applied in company reorganization
and enforcement proceedings.

The bankruptcy estate administrator, the administrator in the company restructuring and certain creditors
may seek to recover assets of the debtor in connection with bankruptcy, company restructuring or enforcement
proceedings. The administrator or the creditors may, within a specified time, either file an action for recovery
against the debtor’s counterparty in a separate court proceeding or file an objection. In bankruptcy, this period to
file an action is one year from the commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings or three months from the
moment that the bankruptcy estate has discovered or should have discovered grounds for recovery. In the case of
a company restructuring program, the administrator must file an action within six months from the
commencement of the restructuring proceedings or within three months from the moment that the administrator
has discovered or should have discovered grounds for recovery.

Certain general rules for recovery apply to all transactions between an insolvent debtor (including a debtor
who becomes insolvent partially due to the transaction) and the counterparty of the debtor. A transaction
concluded within five years prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, company restructuring or
enforcement is filed with the court or relevant authority (as well as transactions performed after such date) may
be recovered if: (i) the transaction, either by itself or together with other transactions, improperly (a) favors a
creditor at the expense of other creditors, (b) places property beyond the reach of creditors, or (c) increases debts
to the detriment of the creditors; (ii) the debtor, at the time of the transaction, was, or partly due to the transaction
became, insolvent or, in case of a transaction considered to be a gift or a contract with the characteristics of a gift,
over indebted; (iii) the counterparty knew or should have known of the insolvency or over indebtedness, or the
relevance of the transaction to the debtor’s economic situation; and (iv) the counterparty knew or should have
known the facts mentioned above in clause (i), on the basis of which the transaction is considered improper. The
grounds for recovery under Section 5 of the Recovery Act (as set out above), which covers all transactions
concluded between the debtor and a counterparty, are thus applicable only if the counterparty had qualified or
should have had qualified knowledge of the issues described above in (i) and (ii). Transactions between the
debtor and certain (natural or legal) persons within the debtor’s sphere of interest (as defined in the Recovery
Act) may be recovered regardless of the date of the transaction.

Pursuant to the Recovery Act, certain transactions can, in certain circumstances, be recovered regardless of
the good faith of the counterparty and regardless of the solvency of the debtor at the time of the transaction. Such
transactions include, among other things: (i) payments received through enforcement; (ii) the payment of debts;
and (iii) the granting of security. Any debt paid later than three months prior to the date when the petition for
bankruptcy, company restructuring or enforcement is filed with the court or relevant authority (or, in the event
that the beneficiary is a person within the debtor’s sphere of interest, within two years) may be recovered if:
(i) unusual means of payment have been used; (ii) the payment was premature; or (iii) the amount of payment
was considerable in comparison to the assets of the debtor. However, a payment may not be recovered if it, when
all circumstances are taken into consideration, may be held as customary. Security given later than three months
prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, company restructuring or enforcement is filed with the court or
the relevant authority (or, in the event that the beneficiary is a person within the debtor’s sphere of interest,
within two years) may be recovered if: (i) the parties had not agreed upon the security in connection with the
granting of the credit; or (ii) the possession of the security had not been transferred, or any similar act perfecting
the security had not been taken without unjustified delay after the granting of the credit.

When a transaction is recovered, the property that has been received from the debtor is returned to the
debtor bankruptcy estate if the debtor is in bankruptcy. The bankruptcy estate or the debtor also returns the
compensation that had been paid for the property. If the compensation has been placed beyond the reach of the
creditors and the party that paid the compensation knew or should have known that this was the intention of the
debtor, there is no obligation to return the compensation. If the property to be returned no longer exists, or is
otherwise not returnable, compensation for the value of the property must be made. In addition, should the return

329


-----

of certain property cause inconvenience to the party under such obligation, a court may entitle such party to pay
compensation equal to the value of the property instead of returning the property. The Recovery Act also sets
forth an obligation to compensate for any decrease in value of the returnable property.

**_Limitations on enforcement of guarantees_**

The guarantee in respect of the Notes granted by any future Guarantor incorporated in Finland (each a
“Finnish Guarantor”) will be limited by a general limitation that limits the scope of the guarantee to the extent
the grant of such guarantee would be contrary to certain mandatory provisions of the Finnish Companies Act
(Osakeyhtiölaki, 624/2006, as amended) (the “Finnish Companies Act”). Pursuant to such limitation, the
beneficiaries of the guarantee agree to enforce the guarantee against any Finnish Guarantor only to the extent that
such enforcement does not result in a breach of the mandatory regulation of the Finnish Companies Act by that
Finnish Guarantor. Certain significant limitations to a company’s ability to grant guarantees are included in
sections 1 and 10 of chapter 13 of the Finnish Companies Act regulating the unlawful distribution of funds and
prohibited financial assistance. Pursuant to the Finnish Companies Act, a Finnish limited liability company, is
prohibited from providing loans, guarantees, assets or security for the purpose of a third party acquiring shares in
such company or its parent companies. While the matter is not entirely clear under Finnish law, the prevailing
view among Finnish scholars seems to be that the financing of an acquisition of shares in a foreign direct or
indirect holding company would fall outside the scope of the before mentioned prohibition provided that such
foreign parent company is not a member of a group of companies controlled by a qualifying Finnish legal entity
but the prohibition of financial assistance may well apply fully to all direct and indirect parent companies of a
Finnish Guarantor, including foreign companies. Further, under Finnish law if a company undertakes a
transaction with or for the benefit of a direct or indirect parent company or another related party on terms that
deviate to the detriment of the company from arms’ length terms, then this may be construed as unlawful profit
distribution. The Finnish Companies Act provides that no guarantee or security may be granted (or any other
transaction entered into) by a Finnish limited liability company without commercial grounds, i.e., unless doing so
is in the company’s own commercial interest. In assessing the existence and scope of corporate benefit to the
company, all relevant circumstances, benefits and risks to the company (on a stand alone basis, and any group
benefit being taken into account only if and to the extent it directly or indirectly benefits the company itself) are
to be taken into account. In the context of the guarantee, among other things, other guarantees and security
granted or to be granted by a Finnish Guarantor for the other financing arrangements of the group companies in
connection with the issue of the Notes are to be taken into consideration. The actual scope of the guarantee by a
Finnish Guarantor may therefore be substantially less than the aggregate amount of liabilities expressed to be
guaranteed and, in fact, it is possible that owing to the application of mandatory Finnish law relating to unlawful
profit distribution, as applied to the guarantee, no liabilities or obligations will under Finnish law, be held to be
effectively guaranteed.

For the abovementioned reasons, it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees
and security documents to include language pursuant to which the scope of guarantees and security granted by
limited liability companies incorporated in Finland is contractually limited so as to not be in conflict with the
relevant statutory limitations. In line with this practice, the Intercreditor Agreement, the relevant Transaction
Security Documents and any Note Guarantee granted by Finnish Guarantor will contain such limitation language
and thus be so limited. By operation of such limitation, the beneficiaries of the guarantee agree to enforce the
guarantee against any Finnish guarantor only to the extent that such enforcement does not result in a breach of
the mandatory regulation of the Finnish Companies Act by that Finnish guarantor.

The limitations referred to above also apply to security granted by a company incorporated in Finland and
the scope of such security would be similarly limited.

**_Creation of a valid security interest_**

Other than in respect of the creation of registered mortgages over assets belonging to certain specific asset
classes (such as real estate, qualifying vehicles and intellectual property rights) capable of being the subject of
registered security, the creation of a valid and enforceable security interest under Finnish law is achieved by
pledging the security assets and perfecting such pledge, typically, in respect of movable assets (including shares,
in case share certificates evidencing such shares have been issued), by transferring such security assets into the
exclusive physical possession of the pledgee or, in respect of receivables (and shares, in case share certificates
have not been issued in respect of such shares), by notifying the person from whom the receivable is owed, or the
company whose shares have been pledged, of the creation of the pledge over the relevant receivables or shares.
In order for the perfection to be effective, the pledgor must be effectively deprived of its right to control, deal

330


-----

with or dispose of the security assets. If the pledgor remains in possession of, retains exclusive or shared control
over, or remains entitled to operate or collect, invest and dispose of any income from such assets, the relevant
security interest will not be deemed to have been effectively created until it is duly perfected, typically after the
occurrence of the agreed trigger event. Perfection cannot be achieved once insolvency proceedings have been
commenced and can be deemed susceptible and be set aside in insolvency proceedings if perfected within a
certain critical time period before the commencement of insolvency proceedings.

**_Enforcement of security_**

The pledge of most movable assets (such as shares) may be enforced without a court judgment or the
involvement of an enforcement official or, should the pledgee deem it necessary, through official enforcement. A
pledge of shares is typically enforced by private sale and a pledge of receivables either by selling the receivable
or by the secured creditor collecting payment of the receivable. Typically collection of receivables directly from
the debtors of the pledgor results in more expedient and profitable outcome than a sale of the receivables, both of
which are forms of self-enforcement. In case the debtor does not pay the debts in the due time, the pledgee has
the possibility to file a claim to the District Court in order to obtain a summary judgment, which can be used as
grounds for official enforcement.

The Finnish Commercial Code (3/1734, as amended, Kauppakaari) stipulates a default process in respect of
an enforcement of pledge of movable assets. The parties may, as a rule, contract out most parts of the default
process. The parties’ discretion with regard to the enforcement methods is, however, limited (a) by the statutory
invalidity of a contractual provision providing that title to the pledged asset shall, upon default, automatically
transfer to the pledgee (however, the debtor and creditor may, after the pledgee has become entitled to enforce
the security, effectively agree that an obligation is discharged partly or in full by the pledgee assuming ownership
of the pledged asset), and (b) by the pledgee always having a duty to ascertain that the interests of the pledgor
and other creditors of the pledgor are not unduly jeopardized due to the actions taken by the pledgee.

**France**

**_Insolvency_**

Some of the Guarantors are incorporated in France (the “French Guarantors”) and part of our business
activity is in France and, to the extent that the registered office of any of the Guarantors is deemed to be in
France, they could be subject to French insolvency proceedings affecting creditors including court-assisted
pre-insolvency proceedings (mandat _ad_ _hoc_ proceedings or _conciliation_ proceedings (procédure _de_
_conciliation)), and court-controlled insolvency proceedings which would qualify as main insolvency proceedings_
under the EU Insolvency Regulation (to the extent that their respective COMI or, in cases where the EU
Insolvency Regulation does not apply, their main center of interests within the meaning of Article R. 600-1 of the
French Commercial Code, is deemed to be in France in accordance with the EU Insolvency Regulation), i.e.,
either safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde), accelerated safeguard proceedings (procédure de
_sauvegarde accélérée) or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde financière_
_accélérée), judicial reorganization proceedings (redressement judiciaire) or judicial liquidation proceedings_
(liquidation judiciaire).

In general, French insolvency legislation favors the continuation of a business and protection of
employment over the payment of creditors and could limit the ability of holders of the Notes to enforce their
rights under the Notes. The following is a general discussion of insolvency proceedings governed by French law
for informational purposes only and does not address all the French legal considerations that may be relevant to
holders of the Notes and/or the Note Guarantees granted by the French Guarantors and corresponding security
interests in the Collateral.

Specialized courts exist for (i) insolvency proceedings (and for conciliation as the case may be) with respect
to debtors that meet or exceed the following thresholds (on a stand-alone basis or together with companies under
their control): (y) €20 million in turnover and 250 employees or (z) €40 million in turnover; (ii) (x) main
insolvency proceedings commenced with respect to a debtor which has an establishment located in another
Member State within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation,(y) secondary or territorial insolvency
proceedings within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation and (z) specific matters in the case where
secondary insolvency proceedings would not have been commenced but main insolvency proceedings have been
commenced in another Member State; or (iii) insolvency proceedings, in cases where the EU Insolvency
Regulation does not apply, with respect to debtors having their centre of main interests (COMI) (centre principal
des intérêts) within the jurisdiction of such specialized courts.

331


-----

Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation lists safeguard, accelerated safeguard, accelerated financial
safeguard, judicial reorganization and judicial liquidation proceedings as insolvency proceedings within the
meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation. Any company of the Group having its COMI in France would be
subject to French main insolvency proceedings within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation and any
company of the Group having an establishment in France and its COMI in another Member State (other than
Denmark) could be subject to French secondary insolvency proceedings. within the meaning of the EU
Insolvency Regulation.

In addition, the French court that commences insolvency proceedings with respect to the member of a
corporate group has jurisdiction over all the other members of the group (subject to specific detention/control
thresholds and French courts having international jurisdiction with respect to such entities, in accordance with the
rules outlined above); accordingly, a court can supervise the insolvency proceedings of the whole group and may,
for this purpose, appoint the same administrator and creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) for all
proceedings in respect of members of the group.

The following is a general discussion of preventive and insolvency proceedings governed by French law for
informational purposes only and does not address all the French legal considerations that may be relevant to
holders of the Notes. When the EU Restructuring Directive is implemented under French law, with respect to
which French law n° 2019-486 dated May 22, 2019 grants the French government twenty-four months to enact
appropriate measures through ordinances for the implementation of the EU Restructuring Directive, some of the
below rules may be substantially amended, including without limitation those applying to creditors’ consultation
process.

**_Temporary measures in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic_**

Within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the French government implemented Ordinance
n° 2020-341 of March 27, 2020, Ordinance n° 2020-596, Ordinance n° 2020-1443 and Law n°2020-1525 dated
December 7, 2020, in force as from December 8, 2020. Such Ordinances and Law provide for specific provisions
applicable for a limited period of time to pre-insolvency and insolvency situation under French law.

In particular, until December 31, 2021, pursuant to Article 1 of Ordinance n°2020-1443 dated November 25,
2020, in force as from November 26, 2020, at the request of the conciliator, the duration of conciliation
proceedings may be extended one or more times, by a reasoned decision of the president of the court, up to a
maximum of ten months (see “—Conciliation Proceedings” below).

In addition, Article 124 of Law n°2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020, in force as from December 8, 2020
extends until December 31, 2021 the following measures that were initially adopted by Ordinance n°2020-596
dated May 20, 2020, in force as from May 21, 2020 that were due to expire on December 31, 2020:

   - additional specific measures aimed at protecting debtors and an adaptation of the provisions governing
grace periods in the context of conciliation proceedings (see “—Conciliation Proceedings” and
“—Grace Periods” below);

   - the loosening of the conditions for eligibility to Accelerated Safeguard Proceedings and Accelerated
Financial Safeguard Proceedings (see “—Accelerated Safeguard and Accelerated Financial Safeguard
_Proceedings” below);_

   - the supervising judge’s right, at the request of the court-appointed administrator or the creditors’
representative, to reduce from 30 to 15 days of receipt of the debt settlement proposal the deadline
during which creditors can respond to a debt settlement proposal in the context of a standard
consultation for the approval of a safeguard or reorganization plan;

   - the possible up to two-year extension of the duration of the safeguard or reorganization plan, as a result
of which such a plan can now last up to 12 years; and

   - the grant of a special privilege for creditors that make new cash contributions to the debtor during the
observation period in order to ensure the continuation of the company’s business and its survival and
for those who undertake to make such contribution for the execution of the safeguard or reorganization
plan ordered or modified by the court (the “S/R Lien”).

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, these rules may be further adapted and additional measures may be put in
place within the following weeks or months, which may have an impact on French insolvency law.

332


-----

**_Grace Periods_**

In addition, and independently from the specific provisions of insolvency laws discussed below, you could,
like any other creditors, could also be subject to Article 1343-5 et seq. of the French Civil Code (Code civil).

Pursuant to the provisions of this Article, French courts may, in any civil or commercial proceedings
involving the debtor, whether initiated by the debtor or the creditor, taking into account the debtor’s financial
position and the creditor’s needs, defer or otherwise reschedule over a maximum period of two years the payment
dates of payment obligations and decide that any amounts, the payment date of which is thus deferred or
rescheduled, will bear interest at a rate that is lower than the contractual rate (but not lower than the prevailing
legal rate, as published twice a year by administrative decree of the Ministry of Economy) or that payments made
shall first be allocated to repayment of principal. A court order made under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil
Code will suspend any pending enforcement measures, and any contractual default interest or penalty for late
payment will not accrue or be due during the grace periods ordered by the relevant court.

If the debtor is engaged in conciliation proceedings or has reached a conciliation agreement that is in the
course of being executed, special rules apply to the grant of grace periods (see “—Court-Assisted Pre-Insolvency
_Proceedings” below). In particular, pursuant to Article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code, the debtor put_
on notice or sued by its creditors retains the right to petition the judge having commenced conciliation
proceedings for a grace period and, pursuant to Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, the judge
having commenced conciliation proceedings may, during the execution period of a conciliation agreement,
impose grace periods on creditors having participated in the conciliation proceedings (other than the tax and
social security administrations) for their claims that were not dealt with in the conciliation agreement.

**_Insolvency Test (Cessation des Paiements) under French law_**

Under French law, a company is deemed in a state of cessation des paiements when it is unable to pay its
debts which are due (which do not include debts in respect of which the relevant creditors have granted a
moratorium) with its available assets taking into account credit lines available to it.

The date of insolvency (cessation des paiements) is generally deemed to be the date of the court order
commencing judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier date, which may
be carried back up to 18 months before the date of the court order. Except for fraud, the date of insolvency may
not be fixed at an earlier date than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement (homologation)
in the context of conciliation proceedings. The date of insolvency marks the beginning of the hardening period
(see “—The “Hardening Period” (période suspecte) in Judicial Reorganization and Liquidation Proceedings”).

**_Court-Assisted Pre-Insolvency Proceedings_**

Pre-insolvency proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor company itself, in its sole discretion;
provided that it experiences or anticipates legal, economic or financial difficulties:

(a) while not being in a state of cessation des paiements in case of mandat ad hoc or conciliation
proceedings, or

(b) while not being in a state of cessation des paiements for more than 45 days in case of conciliation
proceedings only.

_Mandat ad hoc and conciliation proceedings are informal and confidential (subject to the details below as_
regards conciliation proceedings) proceedings carried out under the supervision of the President of the court. The
President of the competent court will appoint a trustee (as the case may be, a mandataire ad hoc or a
_conciliateur) in order to help the debtor company, reach an agreement with its main creditors and stakeholders, in_
particular by reducing or rescheduling its indebtedness. The debtor may propose, in the filing for the
commencement of the proceedings, the appointment of a particular person as trustee. Such proceedings are
non-binding since the court-appointed trustee has no power to force the parties to accept an agreement and the
dissenting creditors will not be bound by the arrangement, if any. Creditors are not barred from taking legal
action against the company to recover their claims, but, in practice, they generally abstain from doing so, to try
and negotiate a consensual restructuring. Should creditors decide to take legal action, the seized court can, at any
time, granted the debtor a grace period that can last up to 24 months.

_Mandat ad hoc and conciliation proceedings may also be used at the request of the debtor and after the_
opinion of the participating creditors has been sought to prepare the sale of all or part of the business of the
debtor with a view to implement such asset sale plan (plan de cession) in subsequent court-administered

333


-----

proceedings. Provided that they comply with certain requirements, any offers received in this context by the
_mandataire ad hoc or the conciliateur may be directly considered by the court in the context of safeguard,_
reorganization or liquidation proceedings after consultation of the public prosecutor.

Contractual provisions modifying the terms of an outstanding contract, by diminishing the rights or
increasing the obligations of the debtor solely by reason of the appointment of a mandataire ad hoc or the
opening of conciliation proceedings, or any request made to this end are deemed null and void.

Equally, contractual provisions that would, as the sole result of the opening of a mandat ad hoc proceeding
or the opening of conciliation proceedings, make the debtor bear the fees of the creditor’s counsel relating to
such proceedings for the portion that would exceed three quarters of the total fee of the relevant counsel are null
and void.

**_Mandat Ad Hoc Proceedings_**

French law does not provide for any detailed rules in respect of mandat ad hoc proceedings. In practice,
_mandat ad hoc proceedings are used by debtors that are facing difficulties of an economic or financial nature but_
are not insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements). There is no time limit for the duration of the mandat ad
_hoc proceedings. The agreement reached by the parties (if any) with the help of the court-appointed officer_
(mandataire ad hoc, whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself and whose duties are determined by the
court appointing him, usually to facilitate negotiations with creditors) can be reported to the President of the
court but, unlike in conciliation proceedings, French law does not provide for any approval by the Court or
recognition by the President of the court with the related specific consequences. This restructuring agreement
between the debtor and its main creditors will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those
creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the arrangement. The mandataire ad hoc is appointed in
order to facilitate negotiations with creditors but cannot coerce the latter into accepting any proposal. Such
proceedings are confidential (save for their disclosure for statutory auditors, if any). In any event, the debtor
retains the right to petition the court for a grace period under Article 1343-5 et seq. of the French Civil Code (see
“—Grace Periods” above).

**_Conciliation proceedings_**

Conciliation proceedings are available to French debtors that face current or foreseeable difficulties of a
legal, economic or financial nature but which have not been cash-flow insolvent for more than 45 calendar days.
The debtor petitions the President of the relevant court for the appointment of a “conciliator” (whose name the
debtor can suggest) in charge of assisting the debtor in negotiating with all or part of its creditors and/or trade
partners an agreement, that puts an end to its difficulties, providing e.g. for the restructuring of its indebtedness.
Conciliation proceedings may last up to four months (with the conciliator being able to request an extension up to
five months). Ordinance n°2020-1443 provides that, for proceedings initiated up to and including December 31,
2021, the maximum duration of conciliation proceedings may be extended at the request of the conciliator, once
or several times, for up to ten months. Such proceedings are confidential (save for their disclosure for statutory
auditors, if any). During the proceedings, (i) no general stay is imposed on creditors which may continue to sue
individually for payment of their claims but they usually in practice restrain themselves from doing so, in order
to negotiate a consensual restructuring and (ii) creditors may not request the opening of insolvency proceedings
(redressement judiciaire or liquidation judiciaire) against the debtor.

In addition, if a creditor seeks payment (subject to the COVID-19 related provisions described below),
pursuant to Article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code, the judge having opened the conciliation
proceedings has jurisdiction to grant a grace period to the debtor, in accordance with Article 1343-5 et seq. of the
French Civil Code, provided that the debtor has received a formal notice requesting payment or faces
enforcement measures, in which case the decision would be taken after having heard the conciliator and the judge
may limit the duration of the measures it orders to the conclusion of an agreement in the framework of
conciliation proceedings.

Due to the COVID-19 epidemic and state of health emergency that was imposed by the French government,
Ordinance n° 2020-341 of March 27, 2020, Ordinance n° 2020-596 of May 20, 2020 and Ordinance n° 20201443 of November 25, 2020 and Law n° 2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020 have modified conciliation
proceedings to provide that, until December 31, 2021:

(1) the duration of conciliation proceedings can be extended upon request of the conciliator, thereby
increasing the maximum duration of conciliation proceedings to 10 months (instead of 5 months
previously);

334


-----

(2) if a creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request made by the conciliator to
defer payment of his claim for the duration of the conciliation proceedings, the debtor may request
from the President of the Commercial Court in ex-parte proceedings, for the duration of the
conciliation proceedings:

(a) the stay or prohibition of any legal action for payment or for termination of a contract for a
payment default;

(b) the stay or prohibition of any judicial enforcement measure against the debtor’s movable or
immovable property as well as any judicial procedure relating to the distribution of the debtor’s
assets that would not have already transferred ownership away from the debtor; or

(c) the deferral or rescheduling of the creditor’s claim;

(3) the debtor may petition the judge that commenced conciliation proceedings for a grace period in
accordance with Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see “—Grace periods” above) even before
the creditor sends any notice to pay or initiates any suit for payment if a creditor does not accept, by the
deadline set by the conciliator, a request made by the conciliator to suspend payment of his claim for
the duration of the conciliation.

Additionally, pursuant to Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, the judge having commenced
conciliation proceedings may, during the execution period of a conciliation agreement (whether it is
acknowledged or approved as described below), impose grace periods on creditors who were asked to participate
in the conciliation proceedings (other than the tax and social security administrations) and have formally put the
debtor on notice to pay or are suing for payment of claims that were not dealt with in the conciliation agreement,
such decision being taken after hearing the conciliator if he/she has been appointed to monitor the
implementation of the agreement.

The conciliation agreement reached between the parties may be acknowledged (constaté) by the president of
the Commercial Court at the request of the parties, which makes the agreement binding upon them (in particular,
performance of the conciliation agreement prevents any action by the creditors party thereto against the debtor to
obtain payment of claims governed by the conciliation agreement) and enforceable without further recourse to a
judge (force exécutoire), but the conciliation proceedings remain confidential.

Alternatively, the conciliation agreement may be approved (homologué) by the Commercial Court at the
request of the debtor following a hearing held for that purpose which will have to be attended by the works
council or employee representatives, as the case may be, if (i) the debtor is not insolvent (en état de cessation des
_paiements) or the conciliation agreement has the effect of putting an end to the debtor’s insolvency, (ii) the_
conciliation agreement effectively ensures that the company will survive as a going concern and (iii) the
conciliation agreement does not impair the rights of the non-signatory creditors. Such approval will have the
same effect as its acknowledgement (constatation) as described above, except that in addition:

   - the decision of approval by the relevant court, which should only disclose the amount of any New
Money Lien (see below) and the guarantees and security interests granted to secure the same, will be
public but the agreement itself should otherwise remain confidential except vis-à-vis the works council
or employee representatives that are informed of the content of the conciliation agreement and may
have access to the full conciliation agreement at the clerk’s office (greffe) of the Court;

   - creditors who, as part of the approved agreement or during the course of the conciliation proceedings,
provide new money, goods or services designed to ensure the continuation of the business of the
distressed company (other than shareholders providing new equity) will benefit from a specific
protection (the so-called “New Money Lien”)and as such will enjoy a priority of payment over all
pre-petition and post-petition claims (except with respect to certain pre-petition employment claims
and post-petition procedural costs), in the event of subsequent insolvency proceedings;

   - in the event of subsequent safeguard, accelerated safeguard, accelerated financial safeguard
proceedings or judicial reorganization proceedings, the payment date of the claims benefiting from the
New Money Lien may not be rescheduled nor written-off without their holders’ consent, not even in
the framework of the creditors’ committees or of the bondholders’ general meeting (although a doubt
may arise as to the application of such provision within the bondholders’ general meeting);

   - when the debtor is submitted to statutory auditing, the conciliation agreement is communicated to its
statutory auditors; and

335


-----

   - in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings, the
date of cessation des paiements (and therefore the starting date of the hardening period (as defined
below, see “—The “Hardening Period” (période suspecte) in Judicial Reorganization and Liquidation
_Proceedings”), cannot be determined by the court to be at a date earlier than the date of the approval of_
the agreement by the court except in case of fraud).

Whether the conciliation agreement is acknowledged or approved, the court may, at the request of the
debtor, appoint the conciliateur to monitor the implementation of the agreement (mandataire à l’exécution de
_l’accord) during its execution and, while the agreement is in force:_

   - interest accruing on the claims that are the subject to the conciliation agreement may not be
compounded;

   - the debtor retains the right to petition the judge that commenced the conciliation proceedings for a
grace period in accordance with Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code as explained
above; and

   - a joint-debtor and a third party which had previously granted credit support (a guarantee or security
interest) with respect to the debtor’s obligations may benefit from the provisions of the conciliation
agreement as well as from grace periods granted to the debtor in the context of conciliation
proceedings.

If the debtor breaches the agreement, whether approved or acknowledged, any party thereto can petition the
court for its rescission. If such rescission is granted, grace periods granted in relation to the conciliation
proceedings may be revoked. Conversely, provided that the conciliation agreement’s terms are complied with,
any individual proceedings by any creditor for the payment of claims covered by the conciliation agreement are
suspended and/or prohibited. The commencement of subsequent insolvency proceedings will automatically put
an end to the conciliation agreement, in which case the creditors will recover their claims (decreased by the
payments already received) and pre-existing security interests or guarantees.

Conciliation proceedings in which a draft plan is supported by a large majority of creditors which is likely to
meet the threshold requirements for creditors’ consent in safeguard, is a mandatory preliminary step of
accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, as described below.

At the request of the debtor and after the creditors taking part in the conciliation proceedings have been
consulted on the matter, mandat ad hoc and conciliation proceedings may also be used to organize the partial or
total sale of the debtor, particularly through an “asset sale plan” (plan de cession) which could be implemented in
the context of subsequent safeguard, judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings. Provided that they
comply with certain requirements, any offers received in this context by the mandataire ad hoc or the conciliator
may be directly considered by the court in the context of safeguard, judicial reorganization or liquidation
proceedings after consultation with the public prosecutor.

As a matter of law, any contractual provision that (i) modifies the conditions for the continuation of an
ongoing contract by reducing the debtors’ rights or increasing its obligations simply by reason of the designation
of a mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings or of a request submitted to this end
or (ii) requires the debtor to bear, by reason only of the appointment of a mandataire ad hoc or of the
commencement of conciliation proceedings, more than three-quarters of the fees of the professional advisors
retained by creditors in connection with these proceedings, is deemed null and void.

Where the maximum time period allotted to court-assisted proceedings expires without an agreement being
reached, the proceedings will end. The termination of such proceedings does not, in and of itself entail any
specific legal consequences for the debtor, in particular it does not result in the automatic commencement of
insolvency proceedings. New conciliation proceedings cannot be commenced before three months have elapsed
as from the end of the previous ones.

**_Court-Controlled Insolvency Proceedings_**

The following French insolvency proceedings may be initiated by or against a company in France:

(a) safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde), accelerated safeguard proceedings (procédure de
_sauvegarde accélérée) or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde_
_financière accélérée), upon petition by the debtor only if, while not being in a state of cessation des_
paiements (or for accelerated safeguard proceedings and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, if

336


-----

in cessation des paiements for less than 45 days when it initially requested the opening of conciliation
proceedings), it is facing difficulties which it cannot overcome. Absent any difficulties it cannot
overcome, the court will invite the debtor to file for conciliation proceedings. It will then rule on the
safeguard petition only.

The conditions for the opening of accelerated safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée)
or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde financière accélérée) are described
below.

(b) judicial reorganization proceedings (redressement judiciaire) or judicial liquidation proceedings
(liquidation judiciaire) upon petition by the debtor, any creditor or the public prosecutor if such
company is in cessation des paiements. Judicial reorganization proceedings are available to companies
whose recovery prospects are possible while judicial liquidation proceedings are available to
companies whose recovery is manifestly impossible.

(c) Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings and the court,
after having heard the debtor, considers that judicial liquidation proceedings would be more
appropriate, it may order the commencement of the proceedings which it determines to be most
appropriate. The same would apply if the debtor requested the commencement of judicial liquidation
proceedings and the court considered that judicial reorganization proceedings would be more
appropriate. As soon as safeguard, judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings are initiated, any
unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable.

While a company may file for safeguard proceedings at any time it is facing insurmountable difficulties, it is
required to petition for the opening of judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings within 45 days
of becoming in a state of cessation des paiements. Alternatively, the debtor may request the opening of
conciliation proceedings within the same timeframe. If it does not, directors and, as the case may be, de facto
managers of the company, may be subject to civil liability.

**_Court-Administered Proceedings—Safeguard_**

A debtor that experiences difficulties which it is not able to overcome may, in its sole discretion, initiate
safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde) with respect to itself, provided that it is not insolvent (see
“—Insolvency Test (Cessation des Paiements) under French law” above). Creditors of the debtor are not notified
of, or invited to attend the hearing before the court at which the commencement of safeguard proceedings is
requested. Following the commencement of safeguard proceedings, a court-appointed administrator
(administrateur judiciaire) is appointed (except for small companies, for which the court considers that such
appointment is not necessary) to investigate the business of the debtor during an “observation period” (being the
period starting on the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings and ending on the date on which
the court takes a decision on the outcome of the proceedings), which may last up to 18 months. The role of the
court-appointed administrator is also to assist the debtor in preparing a draft safeguard plan (projet de plan de
_sauvegarde) that it will circulate among its creditors. Creditors do not have effective control over the_
proceedings, which remain in the hands of the debtor assisted by the court-appointed administrator. The courtappointed administrator will, in accordance with the terms of the judgment appointing him or her, exercise ex
post facto control over decisions made by the debtor (mission de surveillance) or assist the debtor to make all or
some of the management decisions (mission d’assistance), all under the supervision of the court.

If, after commencement of the proceedings, it appears that the debtor was insolvent (en état de cessation des
_paiements) before their commencement, at the request of the debtor, the administrator, the creditors’_
representative or the public prosecutor but, in any event, after having heard the debtor, the court may convert the
safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings.

In addition, the court may convert such safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings,
i) after commencement of the proceedings, at the request of the debtor, the administrator, the creditors’
representative or the public prosecutor, if it appears that the debtor was insolvent (en état de cessation des
_paiements) before commencement of the proceedings, (ii) at any time during the observation period upon its own_
initiative or upon request of the debtor, the judicial administrator, the creditors representative or the public
prosecutor in the case where the debtor is insolvent or (iii) upon request of the debtor, the administrator, the
creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor in case no plan has been adopted by the relevant creditors’
committee and, if any, the bondholders’ general meeting (as described below), if the approval of a safeguard plan
is manifestly impossible and if the company would shortly become insolvent should safeguard proceedings end.

337


-----

At any time during the observation period, the court may also convert such proceedings into liquidation
proceedings if the debtor is insolvent and its recovery is manifestly impossible. In all such cases:

(i) the court may decide at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’
representative or the public prosecutor and in all such cases with the exception of (i) above, the court
may act upon its own initiative; and

(ii) the court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the
creditors’ representative, the public prosecutor, the controllers and the workers’ representatives (if
any).

As soon as safeguard proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor
becomes immediately due and payable.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the state of health emergency that was imposed by the French
government, Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 and Law n°2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020
modified safeguard proceedings to provide that:

   - As an incentive for new financings granted to debtors in the context of safeguard or reorganization
proceedings, a new safeguard or reorganization privilege is created (the “S/R Lien”), applicable
exclusively to proceedings commenced between May 22, 2020 and December 31, 2021. The S/R Lien
is distinct from the existing statutory preference enjoyed by financing granted with the approval of the
bankruptcy judge, after commencement of the proceedings for the needs of the proceedings or of the
observation period;

   - The S/R Lien applies to all new cash contributions made, with the exception of those made through a
share capital increase, by any person:

(a) during the observation period, in order to ensure the continuity of debtor’s business and its
sustainability, in which case such cash contributions must be authorized by the bankruptcy judge,
or

(b) for the implementation of the safeguard or reorganization plan, i.e. within the plan as approved or
modified by the court, and for the purposes of its execution, it being specified that the judgment
must mention all claims benefiting from the privilege, as well as the relevant amounts.

   - Claims benefiting from the S/R Lien enjoy a priority of payment over pre-commencement and postcommencement claims except with respect to employees’ super-privilege claims, procedural costs and
the New Money Lien in the event of on-going or subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial
reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings;

   - Such claims may not termed-out or written-off without the consent of the relevant creditors.

During the safeguard proceedings, payment by the debtor of any debts incurred (i) prior to the
commencement of the proceedings or (ii) after the commencement of the proceedings if not incurred for the
purposes of the proceedings or the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to
the debtor, is prohibited, subject to very limited exceptions. For example, the court can authorize payments for
prior debts in order to discharge a lien on property needed for the continued operation of the debtor’s business or
to recover goods or rights transferred as collateral in a fiduciary estate (patrimoine fiduciaire).

Creditors must be consulted on the manner in which the debtor’s liabilities will be settled under the
safeguard plan (debt write-offs, payment terms or debt-for-equity swaps) prior to the plan being approved by the
court. The rules governing consultation will vary depending on the size of the business.

Standard consultation: This applies to debtors whose accounts are not certified by a statutory auditor or
prepared by a chartered accountant; or, if they are, who have 150 employees or less or a turnover of €20 million
or less, unless upon their or the administrator’s request and with the consent of the court, they are subject to the
committee-based consultation (see below).

In such cases, the administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts to the court-appointed
creditors’ representative, who seeks the agreement of each creditor who filed a claim, regarding the debt writeoffs and payment schedules proposed. Creditors are consulted individually or collectively.

French law does not state whether the debt settlement proposals can vary according to the creditor and
whether the principle of equal treatment of creditors is applicable at this consultation stage. According to legal
commentaries and established practice, differing treatment as between creditors is possible, provided that it is

338


-----

justified by the difference in the situation of the creditors and approved by the court-appointed creditors’
representative. In practice, it is also possible at the consultation stage to make a proposal for a partial payment of
claims over a shorter time period instead of a full payment of such claims over the length of the plan (ten years
maximum except for agricultural business where the maximum is fifteen years).

Pursuant to Article 5 of Ordinance No. 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 adopted in the context of the
COVID-19 pandemic, in force from May 21, 2021 and Law n° 2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020 until
December 31, 2021, the maximum length of a plan can be extended to 12 years, or 17 years for agricultural
businesses.

Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as soon as the
plan is approved are not required to be consulted.

Creditors that do not respond within 30 days of their receipt of the debt settlement proposal (other than
debt-for-equity swap) made to them are deemed to have accepted it. The creditors’ representative keeps a list of
the responses from creditors, which is notified to the debtor, the court-appointed administrator and the
controllers.

Pursuant to Article 4 of Ordinance No. 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 adopted in the context of the
COVID-19 pandemic, in force from May 21, 2021 and Law n° 2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020, until
December 31, 2021, the abovementioned 30-day delay may be reduced to 15 days, at the request of the courtappointed administrator or the court-appointed creditors’ representative.

Within the framework of a standard consultation, the court that approves the safeguard plan (plan de
sauvegarde) can impose a uniform rescheduling of the claims of creditors having refused the proposals that were
submitted to them (subject to specific regimes such as the one applicable to claims benefiting from the New
Money Lien or the S/R Lien) over a maximum period of ten years (except for agricultural businesses where the
maximum is fifteen years and for claims with maturity dates of more than the deferral period set by the court, in
which case the maturity date shall remain the same), but no write-off of any claim or debt-for-equity swap may
be imposed without the relevant creditor’s individual acceptance.

Following a court-imposed rescheduling, the first payment must be made within a year of the judgment
adopting the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual instalment must be of at least 5%
of the amount of each debt claim (except for agricultural businesses)) or on the first payment date following the
initial maturity of the claim if it is later than the first payment date provided for by the plan, in which case the
amount of such first payment is equal to what the creditor would have received had he or she been paid in
accordance with the uniform payment rescheduling applying to the other creditors.

_Committee-based consultation: This applies to large companies, whose accounts are certified by a statutory_
auditor (commissaire aux comptes) or established by a chartered accountant (expert-comptable) and with more
than 150 employees or a turnover greater than €20 million, or upon the debtor’s or the administrator’s request
and with the consent of the court in the case of debtors that do not exceed the aforementioned thresholds.

The consultation involves the submission of a proposed safeguard plan for consideration by two creditors’
committees which are established by the court-appointed administrator on the basis of the claims that arose prior
to the judgment commencing the proceedings:

   - one for credit institutions or assimilated institutions and entities having granted credit or advances in
favor of the debtor (or their successors), but excluding noteholders (the “credit institutions
_committee”); and_

   - the other one for suppliers having a claim that represents more than 3% of the total amount of the
claims of all the debtor’s suppliers and other suppliers invited to participate in such committee by the
court-appointed administrator (the “main suppliers’ committee”).

If there are any outstanding debt securities in the form of obligations (such as bonds or notes and including
capital market debt instruments such as the Notes), a single general meeting of all holders of such debt securities
will be established (the “bondholders’ general meeting”), in which all such holders are to take part irrespective of
whether or not there are different issuances or of the governing law(s) of those obligations.

As a general matter, only the legal owner of the debt claim will be invited onto the committee or general
meeting. Accordingly, a person holding only an economic interest therein will not itself be a member of the
committee or general meeting.

339


-----

The proposed plan:

   - must “take into account” subordination agreements entered into by the creditors before the
commencement of the proceedings;

   - may treat creditors differently if it is justified by their differences in situation; and

   - may, among other things, include a rescheduling or cancellation of debts (subject to the specific regime
of claims benefiting from the New Money Lien or the S/R Lien), and/or debt-for-equity swaps
(debt-for-equity swaps requiring the relevant shareholder consent).

If the plan provides for a share capital increase, the shareholders may subscribe to such share capital
increase by way of set off against their claims against the debtor (as reduced according to the provisions of the
plan, where applicable).

Creditors that are members of the credit institutions’ committee or of the major suppliers committee may
also prepare alternative safeguard plans in accordance with the above principles that will also be put to the vote
of the committees and of the bondholders’ general meeting, it being specified that approval of any such
alternative plan is subject to the same two-thirds majority vote in each committee and in the bondholders’ general
meeting and gives rise to a report by the court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire). Bondholders
are not permitted to present their own alternative plan.

The committees must approve or reject the safeguard plan within 20 to 30 days of its submission. The period
may be extended or shortened but may never be shorter than 15 days. The plan must be approved by a majority
vote of each committee (two-thirds of the outstanding claims of the creditors casting a vote).

Each member of a creditors committee or of the bondholders’ general meeting must, if applicable, inform
the court-appointed administrator of the existence of any agreement relating to (i) the exercise of its vote or
(ii) the full or partial payment of its claim by a third party as well as of any subordination agreement. The courtappointed administrator shall then submit to such person a proposal for the computation of its voting rights in the
creditors’ committees/bondholders’ general meeting. In the event of disagreement, the matter may be ruled upon
by the President of the Commercial Court in summary proceedings at the request of the creditor or of the courtappointed administrator.

The amounts of claims secured by a trust (fiducie) granted by the debtor do not give rise to voting rights. In
addition, creditors whose repayment schedule is not modified by the plan, or for which the plan provides for a
payment of their claims in cash in full as soon as the plan is adopted or as soon as their claims are admitted, do
not need to be consulted on the plan nor take part in the vote.

Following the approval of the plan by the two creditors’ committees, the plan will be submitted for approval
to the bondholders’ general meeting at the same two-third’s majority vote. Following approval by the creditors’
committees and the bondholders’ general meeting, and determination of the rescheduling of the claims of
creditors that are not members of the committees or bondholders in accordance with the standard consultation
process referred to above, the plan has to be approved (arrêté) by the court. The court must verify that the
interests of all creditors are “sufficiently protected” and that required shareholder consent (if applicable) has been
obtained. Once so approved by the relevant court, the safeguard plan will be binding on all the members of the
committees and all bondholders (including those who did not vote or voted against the adoption of the plan).

If the debtor’s proposed plan is not approved by both committees and the bondholders’ general meeting
within the first six months of the observation period (either because they do not vote on the plan or because they
reject it), this six-month period may be extended by the court at the request of the court-appointed administrator
for a period not exceeding the duration of the observation period, in order for the plan to be approved through the
committee-based consultation process. Absent such extension, the court can still adopt a safeguard plan within
the time remaining until the end of the observation period. In such a case, the rules are the same as the ones
applicable for the standard consultation process described above.

If the draft plan provides for a modification of the share capital or the by-laws, the court may decide that the
shareholders general meeting and, as the case may be, the general meetings of the holders of securities giving
access to the share capital of the company shall vote, the first time the relevant meeting is convened, at a simple
majority of the votes of the shareholders attending, or represented at, the meeting, provided that they hold at least
half of the shares with voting rights. The second time the meeting is convened, the usual provisions relating to
quorum and majority shall apply.

If the court adopts a safeguard plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be
essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent.

340


-----

If no proposed safeguard plan whatsoever is adopted by the committees and, if applicable, the bondholders’
general meeting, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ mandataire
_judiciaire or the public prosecutor, the court may convert the safeguard proceeding into judicial reorganization_
proceeding if it appears that the adoption of a safeguard plan is impossible and if the end of the safeguard
proceeding would certainly lead to the debtor shortly becoming insolvent.

_Specific case—Creditors that are public institutions: Public creditors (financial administrations, social_
security and unemployment insurance organizations) may agree to grant debt write-offs under conditions that are
similar to those that would be granted under normal market conditions by a private economic operator placed in a
similar position. Public creditors may also decide to enter into subordination agreements for liens or mortgages,
or relinquish these security interests. Public creditors examine possible write-offs within the framework of a local
administrative committee (Commission des Chefs de Services Financiers). Tax administrations may grant relief
from all direct taxes. As for indirect taxes, relief may only be granted from default interest, adjustments, penalties
or fines.

**_Court-Administered Proceedings—Accelerated Safeguard and Accelerated Financial Safeguard Proceedings_**

A debtor that is engaged in conciliation proceedings may request the commencement of accelerated
safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée) or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings
(procédure de sauvegarde financière accélérée).

The accelerated safeguard proceedings and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings have been designed
to “fast-track” difficulties faced by large companies, i.e., those:

   - that publish consolidated accounts in accordance with Article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial
Code; or

   - whose accounts are certified by a statutory auditor or established by a certified public accountant and
have (i) more than 20 employees, (ii) a turnover greater than €3 million (excluding VAT) or (iii) whose
total balance sheet exceeds €1.5 million.

However, Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 and Law n°2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020
provide that these thresholds will no longer be required for proceedings commenced between May 22, 2020 and
December 31, 2021.

If the debtor does not meet the conditions provided for to constitute creditors’ committee (see above), the
court shall authorize such constitution in the opening decision.

To be eligible to accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the
debtor must fulfil the following conditions:

   - the debtor must not have been insolvent for more than 45 days when it initially applies for
commencement of conciliation proceedings;

   - the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the commencement
of the proceedings;

   - as is the case for regular safeguard proceedings, the debtor must face difficulties which it is not in a
position to overcome; and

   - the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of its business as a
going concern which is supported by enough of its creditors involved in the proceedings to render
likely its adoption by the relevant committees (credit institutions’ committee only for financial
accelerated safeguard proceedings) and bondholders general meeting, if any, within a maximum of
three months following the commencement of accelerated safeguard proceedings, or within a month
following the commencement of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (that can be extended by
an additional month).

While accelerated safeguard proceedings apply to all creditors (except employees), accelerated financial
safeguard proceedings apply only to “financial creditors” (i.e., creditors that belong to the credit institutions’
committee and bondholders’ general meeting), the payment of whose debt is suspended until the adoption of a
plan through accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. The debtor will be prohibited from paying, to any
creditor to whom the accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (as the case may be)
apply, any amounts (including interest) relating to debts incurred (i) prior to the commencement of the

341


-----

proceedings or (ii) after the commencement of the proceedings if not incurred for the purposes of the proceedings
or the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to the debtor (postcommencement non-privileged debts). Such amounts may be paid only after the judgment of the court approving
the safeguard plan and in accordance with its terms. Creditors other than financial creditors (such as public
creditors, the tax or social security administration and suppliers) are not directly impacted by accelerated
financial safeguard proceedings. Their debts will continue to be due and payable in the ordinary course of
business according to their contractual or legal terms.

The regime applicable to standard safeguard proceedings is broadly applicable to accelerated safeguard or
accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (for example, creditors will be consulted by way of a committeebased consultation on, as the case may be, a draft accelerated safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde
_accélérée) or a draft accelerated financial safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde financière accélérée) and_
creditors that are members of the credit institutions committee or the major suppliers committee, but not
bondholders, may also prepare alternative draft plans as described above (see “Committee-based consultation”)),
to the extent compatible with the accelerated timing, since the maximum duration of accelerated safeguard
proceedings is three months and the maximum duration of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is two
months (provided the court has decided to extend the initial one month period). However, certain provisions
relating to ongoing contracts and to the recovery of assets by their owners do not apply in accelerated safeguard
or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings.

In particular, the creditors’ committees and the bondholders general meeting are required to vote on the
proposed safeguard plan within a minimum period of 15 days of its being notified to them in the case of
accelerated safeguard proceedings, or within eight days in the case of accelerated financial safeguard
proceedings.

The plan in the context of accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings
is adopted following the same majority rules as in standard safeguard proceedings and may notably provide for
rescheduling, debt cancellation and conversion of debt into equity capital of the debtor (debt-for-equity swaps
requiring relevant shareholder consent). No debt rescheduling or cancellation may be imposed, without their
consent, on creditors that do not belong to one of the committees or are not bondholders.

If a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within the applicable deadline, the court
shall terminate the proceedings. The court cannot reschedule amounts owed to the creditors outside of the
committee process. Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 and Law n°2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020
provide that for proceedings commenced between May 22, 2020 and December 31, 2021, if a plan is not adopted
by the creditors and approved by the court within the applicable deadline the debtor, the judicial administrator,
the creditors representative or the public prosecutor may request, without any delay, that reorganization or
liquidation proceedings (as the case may be) be opened.

The list of claims of creditors party to the conciliation proceedings certified by the statutory auditor shall be
deemed to constitute the filing of such claims for the purpose of accelerated safeguard proceedings or, as
applicable, accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (see below) unless the creditors otherwise elect to make
such a filing (see below).

**_Court-Administered Proceedings—Judicial Reorganization or Liquidation Proceedings_**

Judicial reorganization (redressement judiciaire) or liquidation (liquidation judiciaire) proceedings may be
initiated against, or by, a debtor only if it is insolvent and, in the case of liquidation proceedings only, if the
debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. The debtor is required to petition for judicial reorganization or
liquidation proceedings (or for conciliation proceedings, as discussed above) within 45 days of becoming
insolvent; de jure managers (including directors) and, as the case may be, de facto managers that would have
failed to file such a petition within the deadline are exposed to civil liability.

Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings and the court, after
having heard the debtor, considers that judicial liquidation proceedings would be more appropriate, it may order
the commencement of the proceedings which it determines to be most appropriate.

The same would apply if the debtor requested the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings and the
court considered that judicial reorganization proceedings would be more appropriate. In addition, at any time
during the observation period, upon request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’
representative (mandataire judiciaire), a controller, the public prosecutor or upon its own initiative, the court
may convert the judicial reorganization proceedings into judicial liquidation proceedings or liquidation

342


-----

proceedings if it appears that the debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. The court’s decision is only taken
after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the controllers, the
public prosecutor and the workers’ representatives (if any).

The objectives of judicial reorganization proceedings are the sustainability of the business, the preservation
of employment and the payment of creditors, in that order.

As soon as judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of
share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable.

In the event of judicial reorganization proceedings, an administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is usually
appointed by the court to investigate the business of the debtor during an observation period, which may last up
to 18 months, and make proposals either for the reorganization of the debtor (by helping the debtor to elaborate a
draft judicial reorganization plan, which is similar to a draft safeguard plan), or the sale of the business or the
liquidation of the debtor. The court-appointed administrator will assist the debtor in making management
decisions (mission d’assistance) or may be empowered by the court to take over the management and control of
the debtor (mission d’administration). Judicial reorganization proceedings broadly take place in a manner that is
similar to safeguard proceedings (see above), subject to certain specificities.

In particular, the rules relating to creditor consultation, especially the powers of the court adopting the
judicial reorganization plan (plan de redressement) in the event of rejection by the creditors of proposals made to
them, are the same (see above). At any time during the observation period, the court can, at the request of the
debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the public
prosecutor or at its own initiative, order the partial stop of the activity (cessation partielle de l’activité) or order
the liquidation of the debtor if its recovery is manifestly impossible. At the end of the observation period, the
outcome of the proceedings is decided by the court.

In addition, Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 modified the judicial reorganization proceedings to
provide for the new S/R Lien (as defined and detailed above see “France—Court-administered Proceedings—
Safeguard”). In judicial reorganization proceedings, in case a shareholders’ meeting needs to vote to bring the
shareholders’ equity to a level equal to at least one half of the share capital as required by Article L. 626-3 of the
French Commercial Code, the administrator may appoint a trustee (mandataire de justice) to convene a
shareholders’ meeting and to vote on behalf of the shareholders that refuse to vote in favor of such a resolution if
the draft restructuring plan provides for a modification of the equity to the benefit of (a) third party(ies)
undertaking to comply with the reorganization plan.

If the proposed reorganization plans are manifestly not likely to ensure that the debtor will recover or if no
reorganization plan is proposed, the court, upon the request of the court-appointed administrator, can order the
total or partial transfer of the business in accordance with the process for a sale as described below.

In judicial reorganization proceedings if (i) the company has at least 150 employees, or if it controls (within
the meaning of the French Labor Code) one or more companies having together at least 150 employees, (ii) the
disappearance of the company is likely to cause serious harm to the national or regional economy and to local
employment and (iii) the modification of the company’s share capital appears to be the only credible way to
avoid harm to the national or regional economy and to allow the continued operation of the business as a going
concern, then, at the request of the court-appointed administrator or of the public prosecutor (x) after the review
of the options for a total or partial sale of the business and (y) if at least three months have elapsed as from the
court decision commencing the proceedings, provided that the shareholders’ meetings required to approve the
modification of the company’s share capital required for adoption of the reorganization plan have refused such
modification, the insolvency court may either:

   - appoint a court officer (mandataire) in order to convene the shareholders’ meeting and vote the share
capital increase in lieu of the shareholders having refused to do so, up to the amount provided for in the
reorganization plan; or

   - order, in favor of the persons who have undertaken to perform the reorganization plan, the sale of all or
part of the share capital held by the shareholders having refused the share capital modification and
holding, directly or indirectly a portion of the share capital providing them with a majority of the
voting rights (including as a result of an agreement with other shareholders) or a blocking minority in
the company’s shareholders’ meetings, any consent clause being deemed unwritten; the other
shareholders have the right to withdraw from the company and request that their shares be purchased
simultaneously by the transferees.

343


-----

In the event of a sale ordered by the court, the price of the shares shall, failing agreement between the
parties, be set by an expert designated by the court in summary proceedings.

In either of the above cases, the reorganization plan shall be subject to the undertaking of the new
shareholders to hold their shares for a certain time period set by the court which may not exceed the duration of
the reorganization plan.

If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator, which
is generally the former creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire). There is no observation period in
judicial liquidation proceedings nor does the law limit their duration (except with respect to simplified judicial
liquidation proceedings). The liquidator is vested with the power to represent the debtor and perform the
liquidation operations (mainly to liquidate the assets and settle the liabilities to the extent the proceeds from the
liquidated assets are sufficient, in accordance with the creditors’ priority order of payment). The liquidator will
take over the management and control of the debtor and the managers of the debtor are no longer in charge of its
management.

Concerning the liquidation of the assets of the debtor, there are two possible outcomes:

   - a sale of the business (cession d’entreprise) (in which case a court-appointed administrator
(administrateur judiciaire) will usually be appointed to manage the debtor during a temporary period
of continuation of the business operations ordered by the court (three months, renewable once) and
organize such sale of the business as a going-concern via an asset sale, i.e. an “asset sale plan” (plan de
_cession), any third party (as construed under French insolvency law) being entitled to present a bid on_
all or part of the debtor’s business); or

   - a sale of the individual assets of the debtor, in which case the liquidator may decide to:

   - launch auction sales (vente aux enchères (or adjudication amiable for real estate assets only));

   - sell on an amicable basis (vente de gré à gré) each asset for which spontaneous purchase offers have
been received (the formal authorization of the bankruptcy judge being necessary to conclude the sale
agreement with the bidder); or

   - in practice, request, under the supervision of the bankruptcy judge, all potential interested purchasers to
bid on each asset, as the case may be, by way of a private competitive process whereby the bidders
submit their offers only at the hearing without the proposed prices being disclosed before such hearing
(procédure des plis cachetés). However, the possibility to implement this process is questioned by
certain legal authors and case-law in this respect has varied.

If the court adopts a reorganization or sale plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it
deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent.

The court will end the proceedings when either no due liabilities remain, the liquidator has sufficient funds
to pay off the creditors (extinction du passif), or continuation of the liquidation process becomes impossible due
to insufficiency of assets (insuffisance d’actif).

The court may also terminate the proceedings:

   - when the interest of the continuation of the liquidation process is disproportionate compared to the
difficulty of selling the assets; or

   - in the event where there are insufficient funds to pay off the creditors, by appointing a mandataire in
charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocating the amounts received from these lawsuits
between the remaining creditors.

**_The Observation Period and its Outcome_**

The period from the date of the court decision commencing the insolvency proceedings and until the court
makes a decision on the outcome of the proceedings is called the observation period (période d’observation) and
may last up to twelve months (with six additional months under exceptional circumstances and upon request of
the public prosecutor) under safeguard or judicial reorganization proceedings. During the observation period, the
court-appointed administrator investigates the business of the company.

Under safeguard proceedings, the court-appointed administrator’s mission is limited to either supervising
the debtor’s management or assisting it, and in any case helping it prepare a safeguard plan for the company. In

344


-----

judicial reorganization proceedings, the court-appointed administrator’s mission is usually to assist the
management and to make proposals for the reorganization of the company, which proposals may include a
reorganization or an asset sale plan. In judicial reorganization proceedings, the court may also decide that the
court-appointed administrator will manage the company alone by replacing the debtor’s management.

At the end of the observation period, if it concludes that the company can survive as a going concern, the
court will adopt a safeguard or a reorganization plan, which will essentially provide for a restructuring and/or
rescheduling of debts which may only entail the partial divesture of assets rather than the entire business, to a
third party (a sale of the entire business is not possible under safeguard proceedings). At the end of the
observation period of judicial reorganization proceedings and alternatively to a reorganization plan, the court
may determine that all or part of the business should be sold to purchasers who have submitted bids. In such a
case, the court orders such a (partial or entire) sale in the framework of a so-called “asset sale plan” (plan de
_cession), which consists of transferring assets, contracts and employees cherry-picked by the purchaser thereto,_
for a lump sum, in accordance with the bid submitted by the purchaser during the observation period.

Judicial liquidation proceedings entail the relief of the debtor of the management and there is no observation
period in such proceedings. The outcome of liquidation proceedings, which is decided by the court without a vote
of the creditors, may be a sale of the business and/or isolated sales of the debtor’s assets in order to discharge the
debtor’s liabilities. Where a sale of the business (partial or not) is contemplated, the court may authorize a
temporary continuation of the business for a maximum period of three months (renewable once for a period of
three months at the public prosecutor’s request) whose effects are similar to an observation period.

If the court adopts a safeguard plan, a reorganization plan or an asset sale plan, it can set a time period
during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continued business of the debtor may not be sold
without its consent.

The sales that have been pre-packed in mandat ad hoc or conciliation proceedings and that are deemed
satisfactory will be implemented in the framework of subsequent court-administrated proceedings through an
expeditious and derogatory process. Such sales can only relate to part (but not all) of the business of the debtor in
safeguard proceedings.

**_The “Hardening Period” (période suspecte) in Judicial Reorganization and Liquidation Proceedings_**

The date when the debtor becomes in a state of “cessation des paiements” is deemed to be the date of the
court order commencing the judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, unless the court sets an
earlier date, which may be no earlier than 18 months before the date of such court order. Also, except in the case
of fraud, the insolvency date may not be set at a date earlier than the date of the final court decision that approved
an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings (see above). The insolvency date is
important because it marks the beginning of the hardening period (période suspecte), being the period from the
insolvency date of the debtor to the date of the court decision commencing the judicial reorganization or
liquidation proceedings affecting it.

Certain transactions entered into by the debtor during the hardening period are automatically void or
voidable by the court.

   - Automatically void transactions include transactions or payments entered into during the hardening
period that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of
other creditors. These include transfers of assets for no consideration or for a nominal consideration,
contracts under which the reciprocal obligations of the debtor significantly exceed those of the other
party, payments of debts not due at the time of payment, payments of the debts that are due made in a
manner that is not commonly used in the ordinary course of business, deposits of cash or monetary
instruments ordered by a court decision that has not yet become final to serve as bond or as a
precautionary measure in accordance with Article 2350 of the French Civil Code, and security granted
for debts previously incurred, provisional attachment or seizure measures (mesures conservatoires)
(unless the attachment or seizure predates the date of insolvency), operations relating to stock options,
the transfer of any assets or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie) (unless such transfer is made as
security for a debt simultaneously incurred), any amendment to a trust arrangement (fiducie) that
affects assets or rights already transferred in the trust as security for debt incurred prior to such
amendment, and notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration
_d’insaisissabilité) pursuant to Article L. 526-1 of the French Commercial Code._

345


-----

   - Voidable transactions include payments made on debts that are due, transactions for consideration and
administrative seizure measure (saisie administrative) notices of attachments made to third parties (avis
_à tiers détenteur), seizures (saisie attribution) and oppositions, in each case if such actions are taken_
after the debtor was in cessation des paiements and the court determines that the party dealing with the
debtor knew that the debtor was insolvent at the relevant time. In addition, transactions relating to the
transfer of assets for no consideration and notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure
(déclaration d’insaisissabilité) pursuant to Article L. 526-1 of the French Commercial Code are also
voidable when entered into during the six-month period prior to the beginning of the hardening period.

There is no hardening period prior to the opening of safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated
financial safeguard proceedings, since the condition required to commence such proceedings is that the company
is not insolvent within the meaning of French law.

**_Extension of Insolvency Proceedings_**

French law provides that, upon the petition of the debtor, of the public prosecutor, the court-appointed
administrator, the creditors’ representative, the controllers or the liquidator, the insolvency proceedings of a
company may be extended to another one, so that their respective assets and liabilities will be treated as
belonging to one single insolvency estate, if (i) the debtor is deemed “fictitious,” i.e. a sham, or (ii) the debtor
“commingled its assets and liabilities” with another entity, i.e. either it proves impossible to determine which
assets and liabilities belong to each of them or “abnormal financial relationships” existed between the two
entities (such as transfers of assets or funds without consideration).

**_Status of Creditors during Safeguard, Accelerated Safeguard, Accelerated Financial Safeguard, Judicial_**
**_Reorganization or Judicial Liquidation Proceedings_**

Contractual provisions pursuant to which the commencement of insolvency proceedings triggers the
acceleration of the debt (except with respect to judicial liquidation proceedings in which the court does not order
the continued operation of the business) or the termination or cancellation of an ongoing contract (contrats en
_cours) are not enforceable against the debtor. Nor are “contractual provisions modifying the conditions of_
continuation of an ongoing contract, diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely upon
the opening of judicial reorganization proceedings” (in accordance with a decision of the French Supreme Court
(Cour de Cassation) dated January 14, 2014, n° 12-22.909, which case law is likely to be extended to safeguard,
accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings). However, the court-appointed
administrator can unilaterally decide to terminate ongoing contracts which it believes the debtor will not be able
to continue to perform. Conversely, the court-appointed administrator can require that other parties to a contract
continue to perform their obligations even though the debtor may have been in default, but on the condition that
the debtor fully performs its post-commencement contractual obligations (and provided that, in the case of
judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, absent consent to other terms of payment, the debtor
pays cash on delivery). The commencement of liquidation proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the
maturity of all of a debtor’s obligations unless the court orders the continued operation of the business with a
view to the adoption of an “asset sale plan” (plan de cession) as described above; in such a case, the acceleration
of the obligations will only occur on the date of the court decision adopting the “asset sale plan” (plan de
_cession) or on the date on which the continued operation of the business ends._

During the observation period:

(i) accrual of interest is suspended, except in respect of loans for a term of at least one year, or of contracts
providing for a payment that is deferred by at least one year (however, accrued interest can no longer
be compounded);

(ii) the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings,
subject to specified exceptions (which essentially cover the set off of related (connexes) debts and
payments authorized by the insolvency judge (juge commissaire) to recover assets required by the
continued operation of the business);

(iii) the debtor is prohibited from paying debts having arisen after the commencement of the proceedings
unless they were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period or in
consideration of services rendered or goods provided to the debtor;

(iv) debts duly arising after the commencement of the proceedings and which were incurred for the
purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period, or in consideration of services rendered or

346


-----

goods provided to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if not, will
be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings (with certain
limited exceptions, such as claims secured by a New Money Lien), provided that they are duly brought
to the attention of the court-appointed administrator or, failing one, the mandataire judiciaire or,
should they both have ceased to be in office, the plan commissioner or the judicial liquidator within
one year of the end of the observation period;

(v) creditors (only financial creditors in the case of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings) may not
initiate or pursue any individual legal action against the debtor (or a guarantor of the debtor where such
guarantor is a natural person and the proceedings are safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated
financial safeguard proceedings) with respect to any claim arising prior to the court decision
commencing the proceedings, if the objective of such legal action is: (a) to obtain an order for payment
of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor (however, the creditor may require that a court
determine the amount due in order to file a proof of claim, as described below); (b) to terminate a
contract for non-payment of amounts owed by the creditor; or (c) to enforce the creditor’s rights
against any assets of the debtor except (i) in judicial liquidation proceedings, by way of the applicable
specific process for judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets or (ii) where such
asset, whether tangible or intangible, movable or immovable, is located in another Member State
within the European Union, in which case the rights in rem of creditors thereon would not be affected
by the insolvency proceedings commenced in France, in accordance with the terms of Article 8 of the
EU Insolvency Regulation; and

(vi) in the context of reorganization or liquidation proceedings only, absent consent to other terms of
payment, immediate cash payment for services rendered pursuant to an ongoing contract (contrat en
_cours) will be required._

A natural person that is the guarantor of the debtor may avail itself of the provisions of a safeguard plan
adopted by the court but not the provisions of a judicial reorganization plan.

In accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the above rules only apply to the creditors who fall within
the scope of those proceedings. Debts owed to other creditors, such as suppliers, continue to be payable in the
ordinary course of business.

As a general rule, creditors domiciled in France whose debts arose prior to the commencement of insolvency
proceedings must file a proof of claim (déclaration de créances) with the court-appointed creditors’
representative within two months of the publication of the court decision in the Bulletin Officiel des annonces
_civiles et commerciales (by exception, the deadline starts upon receipt of an individual notification for those_
creditors whose claim arose out of a published contract or who benefit from a published security interest); this
period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled outside France. Where the debtor has informed the
creditors’ representative of the existence of a claim and no proof of a claim has been filed yet, such claim is
deemed filed with the creditors’ representative. Creditors are allowed to confirm a proof of claim made on their
behalf. Creditors who have not submitted their claims during the relevant period, whose claims are not deemed
filed with the creditors’ representative save for a ratification by the creditor of a proof of claim made on its
behalf, are barred, except with respect to very limited exceptions, from receiving distributions made in
accordance with the proceedings. Employees are not subject to such limitations and are preferential creditors
under French law.

At the beginning of the proceedings, the debtor must provide the judicial administrator and the creditors’
representative with the list of all its creditors and all their claims. Where the debtor has informed the creditors’
representative of the existence of a claim, the claim as reported by the debtor is deemed to be a filing of the claim
with the creditors’ representative on behalf of the creditor. Creditors are allowed to ratify or amend a proof of
claim so made on their behalf until the insolvency judge rules on the admissibility of the claim. They may also
file their own proofs of claim within the deadlines described above.

Under accelerated safeguard proceedings and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the claims held
by its creditors that took part in the conciliation proceedings are listed by the debtor and certified by its statutory
auditors (or, in their absence, its accountant) and are thus deemed to have been filed. Although such creditors
may file proofs of claim as part of the regular process, they may also avail themselves of this simplified
alternative and merely adjust if necessary, the amounts of their claims as set forth in the list prepared by the
debtor (within the above two or four months’ time limit). Those creditors who did not take part in the conciliation
proceedings (but who would be members of the creditors’ committees or the bondholders’ general meeting)
would have to file their proofs of claim within the aforementioned deadlines.

347


-----

If the court adopts a safeguard plan, accelerated safeguard plan, accelerated financial safeguard plan or
reorganization plan, claims of creditors included in the plan will be paid according to the terms of the plan.

If the court adopts an asset sale plan (plan de cession) of the debtor in judicial reorganization or judicial
liquidation proceedings (see above), the proceeds of the sale will be allocated towards the repayment of its
creditors according to the ranking of the claims. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor,
the liquidator appointed by the court will be in charge of selling the assets of the company and settling the
relevant debts in accordance with their ranking.

French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including employees,
post-commencement legal costs (essentially, court officials, fees), creditors who benefit from a New Money Lien
or a S/R Lien (see above), post-commencement privileged creditors and the French State (taxes and social
charges). In the event of judicial liquidation proceedings only, certain pre-commencement secured creditors
whose claim is secured by real estate are paid prior to post-commencement privileged creditors. This order of
priority does not apply to all creditors, for example it does not apply to creditors benefiting from a retention right
over assets with respect to their claim related to such asset.

**_Creditors’ Liability_**

Pursuant to Article L. 650-1 of the French Commercial Code (as interpreted by case law), where safeguard,
judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings have been commenced, creditors may only be held
liable for the losses suffered as a result of facilities granted to the debtor on the following grounds (i) fraud,
(ii) clear interference with the management (immixtion caractérisée dans la gestion) of the debtor or (iii) if the
security or guarantees taken to support the facilities are disproportionate to such facilities. In addition, any
security or guarantees taken to support facilities in respect of which a creditor is found liable on any of these
grounds can be cancelled or reduced by the court.

**_Limitations on Guarantees_**

The liabilities and obligations of each French Guarantor are subject to:

   - certain exceptions, including to the extent of any obligations that would constitute prohibited financial
assistance within the meaning of Article L. 225-216 of the French Commercial Code or infringement of
the provisions of Articles L. 241-3, L. 242-6 or L. 244-1 of the French Commercial Code; and

   - French corporate benefit rules.

Under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from guaranteeing indebtedness of another
company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its acquisition.

Pursuant to French corporate benefit rules, French Guarantors must receive an actual and adequate benefit
from the transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee, taken as a whole. A court could declare any
guarantee unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee, require that the
recipient return the payment to the relevant guarantor, if it found that these criteria were not fulfilled. The
existence of a real and adequate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate
with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance.

Accordingly, each of the Note Guarantees granted by the French Guarantors and the amounts recoverable
thereunder will be limited, at any time, to an amount equal to the aggregate of the proceeds of the Notes to the
extent directly or indirectly on-lent by the Issuer, or used to refinance any indebtedness previously directly or
indirectly on-lent, to that French Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries under intercompany loans or similar
arrangements and outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made by such French Guarantor under its
Note Guarantees. Any payment made by such French Guarantor under its Note Guarantees in respect of the
obligations of any other obligor shall reduce pro tanto the outstanding amount of the intercompany loans or
similar arrangements due by such French Guarantor or its subsidiaries under the intercompany loan or similar
arrangements referred to above. By virtue of this limitation, a French Guarantor’s obligation under the Note
Guarantees could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a French Guarantor
may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantees should the portion of the proceeds of the Notes
made available to such French Guarantor directly or indirectly be equal to zero.

In addition, if a French Guarantor receives, in return for issuing the guarantee, an economic return that is
less than the economic benefit such French Guarantor would obtain in a transaction entered into on an
arm’s-length basis, the difference between the actual economic benefit and that in a comparable arm’s-length
transaction could be taxable under certain circumstances.

348


-----

**_Rights in the Collateral May be Adversely Affected by the Failure to Perfect Security Interests in the_**
**_Collateral_**

Under French law, a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected, and its priority
retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the security. The liens on
the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we, or the
Security Agent, fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens. Furthermore, it should
be noted that neither the Trustees nor the Security Agent shall have any obligation to take any steps or action to
perfect any of these liens. In particular, pledges over the securities of French subsidiaries in the form a stock
company (société par actions) that are governed by French law consist of pledges over a securities account
(nantissement de compte de titres financiers) in which the relevant securities are registered. The securities
account pledges will be validly established after execution of a statement of pledge (déclaration de nantissement)
by each security provider in favor of the Security Agent. Each statement of pledge will have to be registered in
the relevant shareholder’s account (compte d’actionnaire) and shares registry (registre de mouvement de titres)
of each French Guarantor. In France, lien searches may only be conducted in respect of security interests that are
subject to public registration, such as on-going business pledges (nantissements de fonds de commerce),
inventory pledges (gages de stock), equipment pledges (nantissements de matériel et d’outillage), pledges
without dispossession (gages sans dépossession), mortgages (hypothèques), certain types of share pledges (e.g.
_nantissements de parts de sociétés civiles) and certain legal privileges. No lien searches are available for other_
types of security interests that are not publicly registered, such as, amongst others, certain types of share pledges
(nantissements de comptes titres), civil law or commercial law assignments (including Dailly law assignments),
receivables pledges or bank account pledges, with the result that no assurance can be given on the priority of a
security interest if it is not publicly registered.

**_Bank Account Pledge_**

A bank account pledge must be evidenced in writing but there are no public registration requirements
applicable for such type of pledge. In accordance with Article 2360 of the French Civil Code, the French
Guarantors’ pledges of their bank accounts would be strictly limited to the balance outstanding of such accounts
as of when such pledges are foreclosed, or insolvency proceedings are commenced against the applicable French
Guarantor.

In addition, the bank would be precluded from paying to the pledgor any proceeds due under the pledged
claim (i.e., the outstanding balance of the accounts) if the bank has received due notice of the pledge in
accordance with Article 2362 of the French Civil Code.

**_Limitations on Enforcement of Security Interests and Cash Amount (soulte)_**

Security interests governed by French law may only secure a creditor up to the secured amount that is due
and unpaid to it. Pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over a securities account or in the form
of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) may generally be enforced at the option of the secured
creditors either (i) by way of a sale of the pledged securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being
paid to the secured creditors) or (ii) by way of judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or contractual
foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged securities to the secured creditors, following which the secured
creditors become the legal owner of the pledged securities.

If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or
contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed
securities. Such value is determined either by the court in the context of a judicial attribution or by a
pre-contractually agreed expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure. If the value of the Collateral exceeds
the amount of secured debt, the secured creditor may be required to pay the pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal
to the difference between the value of the securities as so determined and the amount of the secured debt. This is
true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent
on-sale of the Collateral. The right to defer or subordinate the payment to the security provider of the cash
amount (soulte) has not been tested in French courts.

If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the
relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining amount
owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect.

An enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with
applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible that the sale

349


-----

price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the securities since the latter will not be sold
pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled by the
vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition
of companies or groups of companies.

**_Security Agent_**

Articles 2488-6 to 2488-12 of the French Civil Code allow the creation of security interests and personal
guarantees for the direct benefit of a security agent, which will hold such rights separately from its own estate.
As a result, the rights of secured creditors under security interests and personal guarantees will be ring fenced if
the security agent is the subject of insolvency proceedings (except in cases of fraud or in cases of the exercise of
a right of pursuit (droit de suite) of a creditor). The security agent will remain liable for gross negligence or
willful misconduct in the performance of its duties. The security agent can take all legal actions to protect the
secured creditor’s interests and file a receivable on behalf of one or several creditors in a debtor’s insolvency
proceeding. The security agent must be appointed pursuant to a written agreement specifying its quality, its
duties, the duration of its duties and its powers.

**_Parallel Debt—Trust_**

The Collateral governed by French law that will secure the obligations of the French Guarantors under the
Notes, will not be granted directly to the holder of the Notes, but will be granted only in favor of the Security
Agent under a parallel debt mechanism under the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement, the
Indenture and the Transaction Security Documents will provide that only the Security Agent, as security agent
and parallel debt creditor, has the right to enforce its security interests in the Collateral. As a consequence,
holders will not have direct security interests and in any event will not be entitled to take enforcement action in
respect of the Collateral, except through the Trustees under the Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of
the Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent for the Collateral.

Under French law, the pledgee of a French law security interest and the creditor of the claim secured by
such security interest are required to be the same person. Such security interest cannot be held on behalf of third
parties who do not hold the secured claim, unless they act as fiduciary (fiduciaire) under Article 2011 of the
French Civil Code or as security agent (agent des sûretés) under Articles 2488-6 et seq. of the French Civil Code.

The beneficial holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the Transaction
Security Documents. In order to permit the beneficial holders of the Notes to benefit from a secured claim, they
will be provided for by the creation of “Parallel Debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent mirroring the
obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) to the holders of the Notes under or in
connection with the Indenture (the “Principal Obligations”).

The Parallel Debt will at all times be in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal
Obligations. Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt
and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Pursuant
to the Parallel Debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an
obligor under the Notes. The pledges governed by French law will directly secure the Parallel Debt, and may not
directly secure the obligations under the Notes and the other indebtedness secured by the Collateral. The holders
of the Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through
the Security Agent (even if they are in some instances direct beneficiaries of the security interests in the
Collateral).

None of the Parallel Debt and trust mechanisms as set forth in the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement
have been generally recognized by French courts.

There is one published decision of the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) on Parallel Debt
mechanisms (Cass. com. September 13, 2011 n°10-25533 Belvédère) relating to a bond documentation governed
by New York law. Such a decision recognized the enforceability in France of certain rights (especially the filing
of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt. In particular, the French
Supreme Court upheld the proof of claim of the legal holders of a Parallel Debt claim, considering that it did not
contravene French international public policy (ordre public international) rules. The ruling was made on the
basis that the French debtor was not exposed to double payment or artificial liability as a result of the Parallel
Debt mechanism. Although this court decision is generally viewed by legal practitioners and academics as a
recognition by French courts of Parallel Debt structures in such circumstances, there can be no assurance that

350


-----

such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, it should be noted that the legal issue
addressed by it is limited to the proof of claims. The French court was not asked to generally uphold French
security interests securing a Parallel Debt. It is also fair to say that case law on this matter is scarce and based on
a case-by-case analysis. Such a decision should not be considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in
France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt claim. There is no certainty that the
Parallel Debt construction will eliminate the risk of unenforceability under French law.

To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Security Agent as
Parallel Debt creditor under the Parallel Debt construction are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of
the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests
in the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency
or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.

The Trustees have certain assigned duties and rights under the Indenture that become particularly important
following defaults or events of default, and acts as trustee in a fiduciary capacity in the best interests of the
holders of the Notes.

The concept of “trust” has been recognized by the French Tax Code and the French Supreme Court (Cour de
_cassation), which has held, in the same published decision referred to above (Cass. com. September 13, 2011_
n°10-25533 Belvédère) that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the State of New
York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings commenced in France. However, while
substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of July 1, 1985
on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so that the concept of “trust” has not been generally
recognized under French law.

To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral granted under French law and created to the benefit
of the Security Agent or to the benefit of the Trustees are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the
Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in
the Collateral granted under French law. In addition, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with
the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as beneficiary of the Parallel Debt or of the Trustees.

**_Fraudulent Conveyance_**

French law contains specific action paulienne provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and
outside insolvency proceedings. The action paulienne offers creditors protection against a decrease in their
means of recovery. A legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to
which such debtor guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides
security for any of such debtor’s or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from
existing security or any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside insolvency
proceedings of such debtor by the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the commissioner of the
safeguard or reorganization plan (commissaire à l’exécution du plan) insolvency proceedings of the relevant
debtor or by any of the creditors of such debtor outside the insolvency proceedings or any creditor who was
prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act in or outside insolvency proceedings. Any such
legal act may be declared unenforceable against third parties if: (i) the debtor performed such act without an
obligation to do so; (ii) the relevant creditor or (in the case of the debtor’s insolvency proceedings) any creditor
was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the legal act was
performed, both the debtor and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more
of such debtor’s creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery (where the legal act
was entered into for no consideration (à titre gratuit), no such knowledge of the counterparty is necessary). If a
court found that the issuance of the Notes, the granting of the security interests in the Collateral or the granting of
a Note Guarantee involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under applicable law,
then the issuance of the Notes, the granting of the security interests in the Collateral or the granting of such Note
Guarantee could be declared unenforceable against third parties or declared unenforceable against the creditor
who lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act. As a result of such successful challenges, holders of the
Notes may not enjoy the benefit of the Notes, the Note Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral and
the value of any consideration that holders of the Notes received with respect to the Notes, the security interests
in the Collateral or the Note Guarantees could also be subject to recovery from the holders of the Notes and,
possibly, from subsequent transferees. In addition, under such circumstances, holders of the Notes might be held
liable for any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the Issuer or the Guarantors as a result of the
fraudulent conveyance.

**_Recognition of Intercreditor Arrangements by French Courts_**

There is no law or published decision of the French courts of appeal or of the French Supreme Court (Cour
_de cassation) on the validity or enforceability of the obligations of an agreement such as the Intercreditor_
Agreement, except for Articles L. 626-30-2, L. 626-32 and L. 631-19 of the French Commercial Code pursuant
to which, in the context of safeguard or judicial reorganization proceedings, the safeguard or reorganization plan
that is put to the vote of the creditors’ committee takes into consideration (prend en compte) the provisions of
subordination agreements between creditors that were entered into prior to the commencement of the safeguard,
or judicial reorganization proceedings. As a consequence, except to the extent referred to above (which, as of the
date of this Offering Memorandum, has received no judicial interpretation), we cannot rule out that a French
court would not give effect to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Recognition of Validity of Second- or Lower-Ranking Financial Securities Account Pledges by French Courts_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides for a mechanism allowing the implementation of second- or lowerranking pledges over financial securities accounts.

To our knowledge, French courts have never expressly recognized the concept of second (or lower) ranking
pledge in respect of a financial securities account and, if Article 2340 of the French Civil Code does recognize
the possibility to create multiple pledges in respect of the same tangible asset, this Article is not expressly stated
to apply to pledges over financial securities account. In addition, a pledge over securities accounts is deemed,
under French law, to remove the securities account from the possession of the grantor, thereby preventing such
grantor from granting a second- or lower-ranking pledge thereon. The second- or lower-ranking pledge over the
shares of such a company will therefore provide that the possession of the securities account is transferred to the
custody of an agreed third party as tiers convenu (entiercement), that the first-ranking and second- or lowerranking secured parties have consented to the creation of second- or lower-ranking pledge and that the firstranking secured parties have accepted their appointment as tiers convenu and hold the pledged securities as
custodian for the benefit of both the first-ranking and the second- or lower-ranking secured parties. This structure
has not been tested before the French courts and no assurance can be given that such second- or lower-ranking
pledges would be upheld if tested. Therefore, there is a risk that the second-, or lower-ranking pledge over the
securities account in which the shares of such company are respectively registered may be held void or
unenforceable by a French court, which in turn could materially adversely affect the recovery under the Notes or
the Note Guarantees (as applicable) following an enforcement event.

**_Assumptions as to the Enforceability of Second-Ranking Bank Account Pledges Over the Bank Accounts_**

Certain pledges over bank accounts are governed by French law. In France, no lien searches are available
for security interests that are not publicly registered, such as pledges over bank accounts. As a result, no
assurance can be given on the priority of the pledges over the relevant bank accounts of a company.

Although French law does not expressly prohibit the grantor of a pledge over a bank account from granting
a second-, or lower-ranking pledge over the same bank account, this structure has not been tested before the
French courts and no assurance can be given that such second-, or lower-ranking pledges would be upheld if
tested.

**Italy**

**Limitation on Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees and Security Interests Under Italian Law**

Under Italian law, the entry into of a transaction (including the creation of a security interest or the granting
of a guarantee) by a company incorporated under Italian law must be permitted by the applicable laws and by its
by-laws (statuto sociale) and is subject to compliance with rules on corporate benefits, corporate authorization
and certain other Italian mandatory provisions. If a guarantee or a security interest is being provided in the
context of an acquisition, group reorganization, refinancing or restructuring, financial assistance issues may also
be triggered.

An Italian company (each an “Italian Guarantor”) entering into a transaction (including granting a
guarantee or a security interest) must receive a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the guarantee or the
security interest being provided by such company. Such principle on corporate benefit applies equally to downstream, cross-stream and up-stream guarantees granted by Italian companies. While the existence of a corporate
benefit in relation to a down-stream guarantee is usually self-evident (i.e., a guarantee guaranteeing financial
obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the relevant guarantor), the existence of a corporate benefit in

352


-----

relation to a cross-stream or an up-stream guarantee (i.e., a guarantee guaranteeing financial obligations of direct
or indirect parent companies or sister companies of the relevant guarantor) depends on the existence of a real and
adequate benefit in exchange for the granted security interest or guarantee and may be challenged unless it can be
proved that the guarantor may derive some benefits or advantages from the granting such the guarantee or
security, therefore it should be carefully considered on a case-by-case basis (such as in the case of Guarantors
which are providing the Note Guarantees in connection with the Notes offered hereby).

The concept of “corporate benefit” is not expressly defined under Italian law and it is assessed and
determined on a case-by-case basis, further its existence is purely a business decision of the directors and the
statutory auditors. As a general rule, corporate benefit is assessed at the level of the relevant company on a
standalone basis, although in certain circumstances, and subject to specific rules, the interest of the group to
which such company belongs may also be taken into consideration. In particular, in case of up-stream and crossstream guarantees for the financial obligations of group companies, examples may include financial
consideration in the form of access to cash flows through intercompany loans from other members of the group,
while transactions featuring debt financings of distributions to shareholders are largely untested in Italian courts,
and, therefore, limited guidance is provided as to whether and to what extent such transactions could be
challenged for lack of corporate benefit and conflict of interest. The general rule is that the risk assumed by an
Italian Guarantor must not be disproportionate to the direct or indirect economic benefit to such Italian
Guarantor.

As a general rule, absence of a real and adequate benefit could make the transaction (including granting a
security interest of a guarantee entered into) by an Italian company ultra vires and potentially affected by conflict
of interest and the related corporate resolutions adopted by the shareholders and directors may be subject matter
of challenges and annulment.

As a result, civil liabilities may be imposed on the directors of an Italian Guarantor if a court holds that it
did not act in the best interest of such Italian Guarantor and that the acts they carried out do not fall within the
corporate purpose of the relevant Italian Guarantor or were against mandatory provisions of Italian law. The lack
of corporate benefit could also result in the imposition of civil liabilities on those companies or persons
ultimately exercising control over an Italian Guarantor or having knowingly received an advantage or profit from
such improper control. However, no liability can be attributed where no prejudice or actual damage is suffered by
the Italian Guarantor because of the determination of the controlling shareholder as provided under Article 2497
of the Italian Civil Code having regard to the overall result of the controlling activity. Moreover, the guarantees
or security interest could be declared null and void if the lack of corporate benefit was known or presumed to be
known by the third party involved in the transaction and such third party acted intentionally against the interest of
such Italian Guarantor.

The above principles on corporate benefit apply equally to up-stream, down-stream or cross-stream
guarantees granted by an Italian Guarantor.

As to corporate authorizations prospective, the granting of a guarantee by an Italian company in favor of
third parties or other corporations belonging to the same group of companies of the Italian Guarantor must be
permitted by the by-laws (statuto) of the Italian company providing such guarantee.

In addition, the granting of a guarantee by an Italian company cannot include any liability which would
result in unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article 2358 or 2474, as the case may be, of the
Italian Civil Code pursuant to which, subject to specific exceptions, it is unlawful for a company to give financial
assistance (whether by means of loans, security, guarantees or otherwise) to support the acquisition or
subscription by a third party of its own shares or quotas or those of any entity that (directly or indirectly) controls
the Italian company. Financial assistance for refinancing indebtedness originally incurred for the purchase or
subscription of its own shares or quotas or those of its direct or indirect parent company would also be a violation
of financial assistance provisions. Any loan, guarantee or security given or granted in breach of these provisions
is null and void. In addition, directors may be personally liable for failure to act in the best interests of the
company.

In the event that an Italian guarantor enters into insolvency proceedings, any guarantee granted by it could
also be subject to potential challenges by a court appointed officer or by other creditors of the relevant Italian
guarantor under the claw back provisions of Italian insolvency law. If any such challenge was successful, holders
of the Notes may not be able to recover any amounts under any guarantee provided by such Italian guarantor and
any amount received must be refunded to the insolvent company.

In light of the above, in no event shall the obligations and liabilities of an Italian Guarantor under a
guarantee include the obligation to guarantee financial indebtedness which was incurred, in full or in part, to

353


-----

purchase the shares of such Italian Guarantor (or of any of its direct or indirect holding company) and which
would therefore constitute the provision of financial assistance within the meaning of Article 2358 and/or Article
2474, as the case may be, of the Italian Civil Code and/or any other law or regulation having the same effect, as
interpreted by Italian courts.

If the proceeds of the Notes were to be used for the acquisition of shares (or quotas, as applicable) in the
Guarantors (the entities which, amongst others, provided the Guarantees) incorporated in Italy (or of any of its
direct or indirect holding company), this may be construed as a violation of Article 2474 and/or Article 2358 of
the Italian Civil Code whereas, in the latter case, a whitewhash procedure (involving anauthorization proceeding
in the shareholders’ meeting by way of which the total value of the guarantee cannot exceed the profits and the
distributable reserves as resulting from the approved financial statements) is not implemented. Failing such
whitewash procedure being implemented, any loan, guarantee or security interest given or granted in breach of
these provisions may be considered null and void.

If and to the extent any Italian subsidiary of the Issuer pursuant to article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code is
legally permitted to and does guarantee the Notes in the future, the relevant deed of guarantee may contain
limitations on the relevant Italian guarantor liability to the extent reasonably necessary to recognize certain
defenses generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer,
voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or
defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable Italian law. See
“—Limitations to the Guarantees and Collateral” below for more details.

Upon certain conditions, the granting of guarantees may be considered as a restricted financial activity
within the meaning of Article 106 of the Legislative Decree No. 385 of 1 September 1993 (the “Italian Banking
_Act”), whose exercise is exclusively demanded to banks and authorized financial intermediaries. Non-compliance_
with the provisions of the Italian Banking Act may, inter alia, entail the Guarantees being considered null and
void. Non-compliance with the provisions of the Italian Banking Act may, among other things, entail the relevant
guarantees being considered null and void. In this respect, the Ministerial Decree No. 53 of 2 April 2015,
implementing article 106, paragraph 3 of the Italian Banking Act, states that the issuance of guarantees or
granting of security by a company for the obligations of another company which is part of the same group does
not qualify as a restricted financial activity, whereby “group” includes controlling and controlled companies
within the meaning of Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code as well as companies, which are under the control of
the same entity. As a result of the above-described rules, subject to the Italian Guarantor and the guaranteed
entity being part of the same group of companies, the provision of the guarantees would not amount to a
restricted financial activity.

In addition, under Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a personal guarantee is issued to guarantee
conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum amount. Such maximum amount
should be expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the guarantee deed or by reference
to a separate document, such as the Indenture). In addition, as mentioned above, the guarantees granted by an
Italian Guarantor must be supported by corporate benefit; in other words, the maximum guaranteed amount must
be indicated in the guarantee and shall not exceed the financial capabilities of the relevant Italian guarantor. It
has been held, that such determination must be proportionate to the relevant guarantor’s assets. If such
determination is deemed disproportional to the assets of the Italian Guarantor, there is the risk that the guarantee
could be declared void. It is uncertain, however, whether courts are entitled to debate and to rule over such
determination.

Italian Law No. 108 of 7 March 1996, as amended, implemented or supplemented from time to time (the
“Italian Usury Law”), prevents lenders from applying interests (including other fees and costs) interests higher
than certain rates, as set forth in accordance with the Italian Usury Law (the “Usury Rates”). In addition, even
where the Usury Rates are not exceeded, the interest rate/overall pricing applicable may be held usurious if: (i) it
is considered to be disproportionate to the amount lent (taking into account the specific circumstances of the
transaction and the average rate applicable to similar transactions in the market) and (ii) the debtor is deemed to
have been in financial and economic difficulties at the time the indebtedness was incurred.

In order to comply with (i) the Italian Usury Law and article 1815 of the Italian Civil Code) and (ii) the
mandatory provisions of Italian law in relation to capitalization of interests (including article 1283 of the Italian
Civil Code), the obligations of any Italian guarantor under a guarantee shall not include and shall not extend to
(x) Usury Rates and (y) any interest on overdue amounts compounded in violation of the provisions set forth by
article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code, respectively.

354


-----

In any event, pursuant to article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, a guarantee granted by an Italian guarantor
must be capped to a maximum guaranteed amount.

In addition to the above, the enforcement of guarantees may further be limited by any defenses,
counterclaims and exceptions arising, inter alia, from Italian contract law, public policy principles, mandatory
provisions, procedural limitations and exceptions set forth in the Italian Civil Code, in the Italian Code of Civil
Procedure and in relevant statutory provisions, as well as by the relevant interpretations of Italian courts.

**Certain Limitations on Enforcement**

The enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be complex and time consuming, especially in
a liquidation scenario, given that Italian courts maintain a significant role in the enforcement process in
comparison to other jurisdictions with which the holders of the Notes may be familiar. The two primary goals of
the Italian law are first, to maintain employment, and second, to liquidate the debtor’s assets for the satisfaction
of creditors. These competing goals often have been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and by
ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold.

Under Italian law, in the event that an entity becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, guarantees and
security interests given by it or by way of a trust or parallel debt obligation could be subject to potential
challenges by the appointed bankruptcy receiver or by other creditors under the rules of ineffectiveness or
avoidance or claw-back of Italian Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or
claw-back of transactions made by the debtor during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect period”). For
a more detailed explanation of the terms, conditions and consequences of clawback actions in an insolvency
scenario, see “—Bankruptcy (fallimento)” below.

If challenged successfully, the guarantee or the security interest may become unenforceable and any
amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest or
guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest or guarantee and may not
be able to recover any amounts under the related security documents.

Furthermore, in the event that the limitations on the guarantee issued by any guarantor incorporated under
the laws of Italy apply and/or there are payment obligations under any Notes other than in respect of principal or
interest, the noteholders could have a reduced claim against the relevant guarantor.

According to Italian law, the enforcement of any claims, obligations, security interest and rights in general
may be subject to, inter alia, the following aspects:

(a) the enforcement of obligations may be limited by the insolvency proceedings listed above relating to or
affecting the rights of creditors;

(b) an Italian court will not necessarily grant any specific enforcement or precautionary measures, the
availability of which is subject to the discretion of the Italian court;

(c) with respect to contracts providing for mutual obligations (contratti a prestazioni corrispettive), each
party can refuse to perform its obligation if the other party does not perform or does not offer to
perform its own obligation thereunder, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of Article 1460
of the Italian Civil Code;

(d) claims arising under Italian law governed documents may become barred under the provision of Italian
law concerning prescriptions and limitations by the lapse of time (prescrizioni and decadenze) or may
be or become subject to a claim of set-off (compensazione) or to counterclaim;

(e) pursuant to Article 1241 and following of the Italian Civil Code concerning set-off of reciprocal
obligations (compensazione), persons who have reciprocal debt obligations may set-off such
obligations for the correspondent amount when both such debt obligations have as an object a
pecuniary obligation or fungible assets and are equally liquid and payable;

(f) where any party to any agreement or instrument is vested with discretion or may determine a matter in
its opinion, Italian law may require that such discretion is exercised reasonably or that such opinion is
based on reasonable grounds;

(g) the enforceability in Italy of obligations or contractual provisions governed by a foreign law may be
limited by the application of Italian overriding mandatory provisions (norme di applicazione
_necessaria) and by the fact that the relevant provisions of foreign laws may be deemed contrary to_
Italian public policy principles and there is no case law setting out specific criteria for the application
of such legal concepts under Italian law;

355


-----

(h) there is some possibility that an Italian court could hold that a judgment on a particular agreement or
instrument, whether given in an Italian court or elsewhere, would supersede such agreement or
instrument to all intents and purposes, so that any obligation thereunder which by its terms would
survive such judgment might not be held to do so;

(i) enforcement of obligations may be invalidated by reason of fraud or abuse of the law (abuso del
_diritto);_

(j) the enforceability of an obligation pursuant to the terms set forth in any agreement or instrument may
be subject to the interpretation of an Italian court which may carry out such interpretation pursuant to
the provisions of Articles 1362 and following of the Italian Civil Code;

(k) any question as to whether or not any provision of any agreement or instrument which is illegal,
invalid, not binding, unenforceable or void may be severed from the other provisions thereof in order to
save those other provisions would be determined by an Italian court on the basis of the interpretation of
intention of the parties, taking also into account the conduct of the parties following the execution of
such agreement or instrument (Article 1419 of the Italian Civil Code);

(l) an Italian company, either directly or indirectly, cannot grant loans or provide security interest for the
purchase or subscription of its own shares unless the strict requirements provided for the Italian Civil
Code are satisfied;

(m) an Italian company must have a specific corporate interest in guaranteeing or securing financial
obligations of its parent company or any other companies, whether related or unrelated, such interest
being determined by the relevant company on a case-by-case basis;

(n) in case of bankruptcy, a receiver in bankruptcy is appointed by the court to administer the proceeding
under the supervision of the bankruptcy court and creditors’ committee and creditors cannot start or
continue individual foreclosure actions (including the enforcement of security interests) against the
debtor (automatic stay) unless otherwise provided by law. Furthermore, the sale of the relevant pledged
assets is carried out by such receiver unless the pledgee is expressly authorized by the bankruptcy court
or by law;

(o) the preemption rights (prelazione) granted by a pledge extend to interest accrued in the year in which
the date of the relevant seizure / attachment or adjudication in bankruptcy falls (or, in the absence of
seizure / attachment, at the date of the notification of the payment demand (precetto)) and extend,
moreover, to interest accrued and to accrue thereafter, but only to the extent of legal interest and until
the date of the forced sale occurred in the context of the relevant foreclosure proceeding / bankruptcy
proceedings;

(p) in order to oppose an assignment to any third party, it will be necessary to notify such assignment to
the relevant debtor or make such debtor to accept it by an instrument bearing an undisputable date
(data certa); the priority of such assignment will be determined accordingly. One way of ensuring that
a document has an indisputable date is that of ensuring that the execution of the relevant document by
one of the parties to it is witnessed by a notary who states the date of witnessing on the document;

(q) there could be circumstances in which Italian law would not give effect to provisions concerning
advance waivers or forfeitures;

(r) the effectiveness of terms exculpating a party from liability or duties otherwise owed is prevented by
Italian law in the event of gross negligence (colpa grave), willful misconduct (dolo) or the violation of
mandatory provisions;

(s) penalties and liquidated damages (penali) may be equitably reduced by a court;

(t) Italian courts do not necessarily give full effect to an indemnity for the costs of enforcement or
litigation;

(u) a security interest does not prevent creditors of the relevant debtor other than the pledge from
continuing enforcement or enforcement proceedings on the assets secured by the relevant pledge; and

(v) in case of bankruptcy of the grantor of the pledge over quotas or shares, the assets secured by the
pledge could be freely sold to any third party in the context of the relevant bankruptcy proceeding and,
as a consequence, the proceeds would be set aside for the prior satisfaction of the pledgee but the
pledge would be terminated and, therefore, the latter would lose entitlement to the voting rights on the
pledged quotas / shares.

356


-----

In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business, an action can
be brought by any creditor of a given debtor within five years from the date in which the latter enters into a
guarantee, security, agreement and any other act by which it disposes of any of its assets, in order to seek a
clawback action (azione revocatoria ordinaria) pursuant to Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code (which results
in a declaration of ineffectiveness as to the acting creditor) of the said guarantee, security, agreement and other
act that is purported to be prejudicial to the acting creditor’s right of credit. An Italian court could revoke the said
guarantee, security, agreement and other act only if it, in addition to the ascertainment of the prejudice, was to
make the two following findings:

(a) that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the acting creditor,
or, if such act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the act was fraudulently
designed for the purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit; and

(b) that, in the case of non-gratuitous act, the third party involved was aware of said prejudice and, if the
act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that said third party participated in the
fraudulent design.

Furthermore, under fraudulent conveyance and other provisions of Italian law, a court could void or
invalidate all or a portion of the obligations of a guarantor under the relevant guarantee and, if payment had
already been made under that guarantee, require the recipients of that payment to return the payment to the
relevant guarantor, if the court found that, inter alia:

(a) the relevant guarantor gave such guarantee with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud its current or
future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or when the beneficiary of the
guarantee was aware that the relevant guarantor was insolvent when it gave the relevant guarantee;

(b) the relevant guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for its guarantee
or the relevant guarantor was insolvent at the time the guarantee was given;

(c) the relevant guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the relevant guarantor or not to be in
the best interest or for the corporate benefit of the relevant guarantor; or

(d) the guarantor giving such guarantee was aware, or should have been aware, that the transaction was to
the detriment of the creditors.

If a court decided either that a guarantee was a fraudulent conveyance and voided such guarantee, or held it
unenforceable for any other reason, the beneficiary of the guarantee may cease to have any claim with respect to
the relevant guarantor. The same would also apply to any security interest.

**_Limitations to the Guarantees and Collateral_**

In order to comply with the above corporate law requirements on, inter alia, corporate benefit and financial
assistance (as described above), the maximum amount that any Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Italy
may be required to pay in respect of its obligations as Guarantor (an “Italian Guarantor”) under the Indenture,
the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and any other transaction documents
related thereto, will be subject to limitations. By virtue of these limitations, an Italian Guarantor’s obligations
under its Guarantee will be significantly less than the amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or an Italian
Guarantor the Italian company may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee and security interests
granted by it. As a result of the applicable limitations under Italian law with respect to, amongst others, financial
assistance and corporate benefit, notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the Indenture, the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement:

(i) the Guarantee and security interests granted by the relevant Italian Guarantor will only guarantee and
secure the Issuers’ obligations under Tranche B (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes and
shall not exceed at any time an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of any intercompany
loans or other financial support in any form (such term, for the avoidance of doubt, not including equity
contributions), advanced from time to time to such Italian Guarantor (or any of its direct or indirect
Subsidiaries pursuant to article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code) by the Issuer (whether directly or
indirectly) on or following the Issue Date and outstanding at the time of the enforcement of the relevant
guarantee, in each case net of any proceeds already paid pursuant to the enforcement of its guarantee
under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and/or the Intercreditor Agreement and/or
received upon the enforcement of any security interests granted by the Italian Guarantor, and in any
event subject to the Intercreditor Agreement provided that the Italian Guarantor shall not be liable as a

357


-----

Guarantor in respect of any amounts in excess of the amount that such Italian Guarantor is entitled to
(and actually can) set-off against its claims of recourse or subrogation (regresso or surrogazione)
arising as a result of any payment made by such Italian Guarantor under its Guarantee;

(ii) the maximum amount guaranteed and/or secured by an Italian Guarantor, also in accordance with
article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code (where applicable), will not exceed the lower of (a) 120% of the
outstanding principal amount of the Notes, and (b) the aggregate amount of the original principal
amount of Tranche B (as defined in “Use of proceeds”) under the Notes, reduced, from time to time, by
an amount equal to any repayment, prepayment or redemption of the principal amount of the Notes
multiplied by the ratio of (A) the aggregate amount of the original principal amount of the Tranche B
(as defined in “Use of proceeds”) under the Notes to (B) the original principal amount of the Notes;

(iii) the aggregate amount of interest guaranteed and/or secured by an Italian Guarantor in respect of any
payment obligations under Tranche B under the Notes will be at any time equal to the interest then
outstanding in respect of a principal amount of the Notes equal to the principal amount of Tranche B
under the Notes at that time;

(iv) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Indenture, in order to comply with the mandatory
provisions of Italian law in relation to (a) maximum interest rates (including the Italian Usury Law and
article 1815 of the Italian Civil Code) and (b) capitalization of interests (including article 1283 of the
Italian Civil Code and article 120 of the Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of 1 September 1993), the
obligations of an Italian Guarantor under its Guarantee shall not include and shall not extend to (A) any
interest qualifying as usurious pursuant the Italian Usury Law and (B) any interest on overdue amounts
compounded in violation of the provisions set forth by article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and/or
article 120 of the Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of 1 September 1993, respectively; and

(v) any guarantee, indemnity, obligations and liability granted or assumed pursuant to the relevant Guarantee
and/or security interest by any Italian Guarantor does not (and will not) include and does not (and will
not) extend, directly or indirectly, to any amounts and/or payment obligations other than the amounts and/
or payment obligations under Tranche B (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes.

The abovementioned “virtual tranching” structure in respect of the Notes, which is aimed at identifying the
relevant portion of the Notes’ proceeds which does not constitute “acquisition debt” (or refinancing thereof) in
respect of any Italian Guarantor and, therefore, does not fall within the prohibition under Italian financial
assistance rules (namely, Article 2358 or 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code), is untested in Italian
courts and it cannot be excluded that it might be deemed not sufficient to clearly distinguish and separate the
non-acquisition portion of the Notes’ proceeds from any portion of the Notes’ proceeds to be utilized to support
the acquisition or subscription by the Issuer of the share capital of, respectively, an Italian Guarantor or an entity
directly or indirectly controlling it and/or to repay existing debt originating from previous acquisition schemes
and/or otherwise in contravention of any provisions regulating financial assistance. Should the Guarantee and/or
the security interests and/or indemnities granted and/or assumed by an Italian Guarantor be deemed by a court or
public authority to be contrary to any provisions regulating financial assistance, including Articles 2358 and
2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code, such Guarantee and/or security interests and/or indemnities as well
as any other contract entered in connection therewith could be declared null and void and the Notes documents
will provide that, if and to the extent such Guarantee would result in a breach of any provisions regulating
financial assistance, including Articles 2358 and 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code, applicable to such
Italian Guarantor, such an Italian Guarantor will be deemed to have no liability thereunder and the Guarantee
shall not be in force and effect ab initio.

In addition, the obligations of any Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider that becomes a
Guarantor and/or a security provider will be subject to the Agreed Security Principles and will be subject to the
additional limitations (including those set out in paragraph (i) above) set forth in the relevant supplemental
indenture to the Indenture and/or in the applicable security documents, in order for the applicable Italian
Guarantor and/or Italian security provider to comply with the above corporate law requirements on, among
others, corporate benefit and financial assistance.

In any case, the maximum amount that an Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider, in each case,
may be required to pay in respect of its obligations as Guarantor under the Indenture and/or security grantor
under the relevant security documents upon enforcement of the security interests granted by such Italian
Guarantor will ratably concur and not cumulate with the corresponding amounts due by such Italian Guarantor
and/or Italian security provider to any guaranteed and/or secured creditor pursuant to the Senior Secured Credit

358


-----

Facilities Agreement and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (including any guaranteed and/or secured creditors with
respect to any further pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement) and/or any
security documents, and vice versa. For the avoidance of doubt, by virtue of the abovementioned limitations
applicable to the guarantees and the security interests granted by an Italian Guarantor, the obligations of each
Italian Guarantor as guarantor and/or security provider under the Notes, the Indenture, the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and any agreement regulating future pari passu indebtedness
contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement-the security documents relating to the Collateral and any other
transaction documents related thereto shall not be deemed to be cumulative and shall be considered without
duplication, and the transaction documents will provide that the aggregate amount of the proceeds deriving from
any enforcement of any such guarantee and/or security obligations of the relevant Italian Guarantor shall not
exceed on an aggregate basis the limit of the relevant Italian Guarantor’s credit support as described above.

The proceeds of the enforcement of said guarantees and/or security interests will be distributed amongst the
guaranteed and/or secured creditors (including, without, limitation, the holders of the Notes) in accordance with
the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Accordingly, the holders of the Notes will be able to recover
limited amounts under the relevant Guarantees and security. In particular, considering that the guaranteed
aggregate amount under its Guarantee and related security interests is capped to the amount of the intercompany
loans or other financial support in any form received after the Issue Date by the Italian Guarantor or its
Subsidiaries and subject to the relevant set off rights described above (which are aimed at avoiding duplications
of the exposure between the relevant intercompany loans or other financial support received and the exposure
under the Guarantee), that Guarantee and security interests would have a very limited or no value if no such
intercompany loans or other financial support were to be made available to such entities.

_Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code_

Pursuant to Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a guarantee granted by an Italian Guarantor is issued to
guarantee conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum amount. Such maximum
amount should be expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the guarantee deed or by
reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture). In addition, as mentioned above, the guarantees granted
by an Italian Guarantor must be supported by corporate benefit; in other words, the maximum guaranteed amount
must be indicated in the guarantee and shall not exceed the financial capabilities of the relevant Italian Guarantor.
It has been held that such determination must be proportionate to the relevant Italian Guarantor’s assets. If such
determination is deemed disproportional to the assets of the relevant Italian Guarantor, there is the risk that the
guarantee could be declared void.

_Certain Considerations in Relation to Security Interests_

_Trust and Security Agent_

The Collateral granted by an Italian Guarantor will be created and perfected in favor of the Security Agent
also acting in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Article
2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code. Under such provision (introduced by Italian Law No. 164 of
November 11, 2014), the security interests and guarantees assisting bond issuances can be validly created in
favor of the holders of the notes or in favor of a representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes who
will then be entitled to exercise in the name and on behalf of the holders all their rights (including any rights
before any court and judicial proceedings) relating to the security interests and guarantees. However, there is no
guidance or available case law on the exercise of the rights and enforcement of such security interest and
guarantees by a Rappresentante pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code also in the
name and on behalf the holders of the Notes which are neither directly parties to the Collateral nor are
specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries.

In addition, as the holders of the Notes are not direct parties to the Indenture, there is the risk that the
appointment of the Security Agent in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes
pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code is not upheld by an Italian court and that
therefore an Italian court may determine that the holders of the Notes at the time of enforcement are not secured
by the security under the Transaction Security Documents and/or that the rappresentante cannot exercise the
rights and enforce the Collateral also in the name and on behalf of the holders of the Notes. In addition, the
provisions and the subject matter of paragraph 3 of Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code are
new and, as such, untested by Italian Courts and, therefore, even if the appointment of the rappresentante is
upheld by an Italian Court, it cannot be excluded that an Italian Court may take a different view and

359


-----

interpretation and determine that, where the Collateral is granted in favor of the rappresentante, the holders of the
Notes at the time of enforcement are not secured by the Collateral and/or cannot enforce that Collateral.

Moreover, it is uncertain and untested in the Italian courts whether, under Italian law, a security interest can
be created and perfected: (i) in favor of creditors (such as the holders of the Notes) which are neither directly
parties to the relevant security documents or are not specifically identified therein or in the relevant share
certificates and corporate documents or public registries; and (ii) in favor of a “trustee,” since there is no
established concept of “trust” or “trustee” under Italian law and the precise nature, effect and enforceability of
the duties, rights and powers of a “trustee” as trustee under security interests granted over Italian assets is
uncertain under Italian law and (iii) can effectively be granted in favor of an entity acting as “rappresentante” of
the noteholders pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code in connection with notes
issued by an entity incorporated outside of Italy and absent a resolution by the competent corporate body of the
foreign issuer appointing a notary to carry out any formality required under the laws of Italy for the creation of
security interests.

_Undercapitalization_

Italian corporate law (Articles 2497-quinquies and 2467 of the Italian Civil Code) provides for rules to
protect creditors against “undercapitalized companies” and provides for remedies in respect thereof. In this
respect, in case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or
exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company, or (ii) any entity subject to the
management and coordination powers of the same person, or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a company
incorporated in Italy as a società a responsabilità limitata, such loan will be subordinated to all other creditors of
that borrower and rank senior only to the equity in that borrower, if the loan is made when, taking into account
the kind of business of the borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower’s indebtedness compared
to its net assets or the borrower was already in a financial situation requiring an injection of equity and not a loan
(“undercapitalization”). Any payment made by the borrower with respect to any such loan within one year prior
to a bankruptcy declaration would be required to be returned to the borrower. The above rules apply to
shareholders’ loans “made in any form” and scholars generally conclude that such provisions should be
interpreted broadly and apply to any form of financial support provided to a company by its shareholders, either
directly or indirectly.

As of the date hereof, there are several court precedents interpreting the provisions summarized above.
Some of such precedents have held that Article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also applies to companies
incorporated as società per azioni, hence potentially to the borrowers under the intercompany loans that are
incorporated as società per azioni.

Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, Italian courts
may apply such provisions of the Italian Civil Code to the Issuer’s relationship with Italian subsidiaries under the
relevant intercompany loans. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude that the obligations of any Italian
subsidiary under any intercompany loan are subordinated to all its obligations towards other creditors. Should
any of the obligations of any subsidiary under any intercompany loan or note be deemed subordinated to the
obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior only to the equity, the Issuer may not be able
to recover any amounts under any intercompany loan or note granted to the Italian subsidiaries, which could have
a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to meet its payment obligations under the Notes. Moreover, in
circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loans or notes are
subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover under any Collateral created
over such intercompany loans or notes or any guarantees granted by such Italian subsidiaries may be impaired or
restricted.

_General_

The procedures for the enforcement of Italian law security and the timing for obtaining judicial decisions
(including in relation to security enforcement) in the Republic of Italy are materially complex and timeconsuming, especially given that the Italian courts maintain a significant role in the enforcement process, in
comparison to other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar.

**Certain Italian Insolvency Law Considerations**

The insolvency laws of Italy may not be as favorable to investors’ interests as those of other jurisdictions
with which investors may be familiar. In Italy, courts play a central role in the insolvency process. Moreover,

360


-----

in-court procedures may be materially more complex and the enforcement of security interests by creditors in
Italy can be more time-consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which investors may be
familiar.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy, which does not include
special provisions applying to banks, insurance and other companies authorized to carry out certain reserved
activities (except for the description of certain insolvency proceeding to which they may be subject) nor does it
provide a comprehensive description of insolvency laws applicable to public companies.

Insolvency laws and regulations have recently been comprehensively reviewed and reformed, and
significant amendments are expected in the near future. In particular, on October 19, 2017, the Italian Senate
approved Law No. 155, pursuant to which it has authorized the government to carry out a substantial reform of
Italian insolvency laws, on the basis of several guidelines. The purpose of the 2019 Reform was mostly (i) to
ensure the rationality of the provisions on insolvency, affected over the years by various amendments (especially
in the civil sector) which caused a great degree of legal uncertainty, (ii) to allow early awareness of the financial
distress of a business and (iii) to safeguard the business’ entrepreneurial potential during a crisis (the “2019
_Reform”)._

On January 12, 2019, the Italian government enacted a new bankruptcy code implementing the guidelines
contained in Law No. 155 dated October 19, 2017, which enacts a new comprehensive legal framework in order
to regulate, inter alia, insolvency matters (so-called “Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency,” the “Insolvency
_Code”). The main innovations introduced by the Insolvency Code include: (i) the elimination of the term_
“bankrupt” (fallito) due to its negative connotation and the replacement of bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento)
with a reference to a judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale); (ii) the introduction of a definition of “state of
crisis” (stato di crisi); (iii) the adoption of the same procedural framework in order to ascertain such state of
crisis and to access the different judicial insolvency proceedings provided for by the Insolvency Code; (iv) a new
set of rules concerning group restructurings; (v) restrictions to the use of the pre-bankruptcy composition with
creditors (concordato preventivo) in order to favor going-concern proceedings; (vi) a new preventive alert and
mediation phase to avoid insolvency; (vii) jurisdiction of specialized courts over proceedings involving large
debtors and (viii) amendments to certain provisions of the Italian Civil Code aimed at ensuring the general
effectiveness of the 2019 Reform. Therefore, the practical consequences of its implementation and its potential
impact on the existing insolvency proceedings cannot to date be foreseen and significant amendments are
expected in the near future that may impact the provisions set forth therein. All types of debtors, with the
exception of the State and public entities, will be subject to the procedures set out therein. Indeed, the Insolvency
Code shall apply both to natural persons (consumers, professionals and entrepreneurs) and to legal persons
(including non-profit companies, organizations and groups of companies).

On February 14, 2019, the Insolvency Code has been published in the official journal. Pursuant to the Law
Decree No. 23 of April 8, 2020, entry into force of the Insolvency Code has been set to September 1, 2021). Until
that date, insolvency proceedings will continue to be governed by Italian Royal Decree No. 267 of March 16,
1942 (the “Italian Bankruptcy Law”), as in force before.

Leaving aside the 2019 Reform, the Italian Bankruptcy Law saw many reforms in the near past. In
particular, material innovations regarding pre-bankruptcy composition and debt restructuring agreements under
Article 160 and 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and out of court restructuring plans pursuant to Article 67,
paragraph 3(d), of the Italian Bankruptcy Law were introduced by Law Decree no. 83 of June 22, 2012, as
converted by Law no. 134 of August 3, 2012 (the “Development Decree”). The purpose of this reform was to
boost the restructuring and reorganization of distressed enterprises in order to cope better with the current
financial crisis. To achieve this purpose, the Development Decree has focused mainly on three factors: flexibility
of the process, reliability of the restructuring plan and tax appeal.

Amendments to the Italian Bankruptcy Law were also introduced with regard to the pre-bankruptcy
composition with creditors by Decree no. 69 of June 21, 2013, which sets out urgent measures aimed at boosting
the country’s economy (the “Decreto del Fare”) and includes some important changes to the rules regarding the
application introduced by the Development Decree.

A significant reform was approved by the Italian government on June 23, 2015, through a Law Decree
containing urgent reforms applicable, inter alia, to Italian bankruptcy law (the “Decree No. 83”). The Decree
No. 83 (“Urgent reforms concerning Bankruptcy Law, Civil Law, Civil Procedure Law and Court
_administration”) entered into force in June 2015 and was incorporated into Italian law by Italian Law No. 132 of_
August 6, 2015 (the “Law 132”). Law 132/2015 entered into force on 21 August 2015. Amendments were also

361


-----

implemented by means of the adoption of (a) the Law Decree No. 59 of May 3, 2016, converted into law by
Italian Law No. 119 of June 30, 2016, and (b) Italian Law No. 232 of December 11, 2016.

The two primary aims of the Italian Bankruptcy Law are to liquidate the debtor’s assets and protect the
goodwill of the going concern (if any) for the satisfaction of creditors’ claim as well as, in case of the “Prodi-bis”
procedure or “Marzano” procedure, to maintain employment. This competing aims often have been balanced by
the sale of businesses as going-concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses
being sold. However, the Italian Bankruptcy Law has been recently amended with a view to promoting rescue
procedures rather than liquidation, focusing on the continuity and survival of financially distressed businesses
and enhancing pre-bankruptcy restructuring options.

Under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, bankruptcy (fallimento) must be declared by a court, based on the
insolvency (insolvenza) of a company upon a petition filed by the company itself, the public prosecutor and/or
one or more creditors. Insolvency, as defined under Article 5 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a
debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations as they come due. This must be a permanent, and not a
temporary, status of insolvency, in order for a court to hold that a company is insolvent.

In cases where a company is facing financial difficulties or temporary cash shortfall and, in general,
financial distress, it may be possible for it to enter into out of court arrangements with its creditors, which may
safeguard the existence of the company, but which are susceptible to being reviewed by a court in the event of a
subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions.

The following debt restructuring, and bankruptcy alternatives are available to companies in a state of crisis
and/or facing insolvency under Italian law.

**Restructuring Outside of a Judicial Process (Accordi Stragiudiziali)**

Restructuring generally takes place through a formal judicial process because it is more favorable to the
debtor and because informal out-of-court arrangements put in place as a result of an out-of-court restructuring are
vulnerable to being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as
voidable transactions and may trigger liabilities in the event of a subsequent bankruptcy. However, in cases
where a company is solvent, but facing financial difficulties, it may be possible to enter into an out of court
arrangement with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company.

**Out of court Reorganization Plans (Piani di risanamento) Pursuant to Article 67, paragraph 3, letter (d), of**
**the Italian Bankruptcy Law**

Article 67, third paragraph, lett. (d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for an out of court restructuring
procedure based on a rescue plan (piano di risanamento) and is aimed at restructuring the company’s
indebtedness and ensuring the recovery of its financial condition. An independent expert appointed directly by
the debtor and enrolled in the Register of Auditors and Accounting Experts (Registro dei Revisori Contabili) has
to verify (i) the financial and commercial feasibility of the restructuring plan and (ii) the truthfulness of the
business and accounting data provided by the company and included in the plan. There is no need to obtain court
approval to appoint the expert. The expert must possess certain specific professional requisites and qualifications
and meet the requirements set forth by Article 2399 of the Italian Civil Code. The expert may be liable for
misrepresentation or false certification.

Out-of-court debt restructuring arrangements are not under any form of judicial control or approval and,
therefore, no application is required to be filed with the court or supervising authority. Out-of-court debt
restructuring arrangements are not required to be approved and consented to by a specific majority of all
outstanding claims.

The terms and conditions of the restructuring plans are freely negotiable, provided that they are finalized at
restructuring the debtor’s indebtedness and rebalancing its capital structure. Unlike in composition with creditors
proceedings and debt restructuring agreements, out of court reorganization plans pursuant to Article 67,
Paragraph 3, lett. d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law do not offer the debtor any protection against enforcement
proceedings and/or precautionary actions of third-party creditors. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides that,
should these plans fail and the debtor be declared bankrupt, the payments and/or acts carried out for the
implementation of the reorganization plan, subject to certain conditions: (a) are not subject to claw-back action;
and (b) are exempted from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions. Neither ratification by the court
nor publication in the companies’ register are needed (although, publication in the companies’ register is possible
upon a debtors request and would allow for certain tax benefits) and, therefore, the risk of bad publicity or

362


-----

disvalue judgments are lower than in case of a court-supervised composition with creditors or a debt restructuring
agreement.

In order to grant protection against claw-back actions and potential civil and criminal responsibilities, out of
court reorganization plans pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3, lett. d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law must be
supported by adequate documentation representing the financial and commercial situation of the company.
Moreover, they must be suitable for the purpose of assuring the restructuring of the indebtedness of the debtor
and the rebalancing of its financial position and, in case of its failure and subsequent challenge before an Italian
court, it must not be deemed as unreasonable.

**Court-Supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (concordato preventivo)**

A company, which is insolvent or in a status of crisis (i.e., financial distress which does not yet amount to
insolvency) and that has not been declared insolvent by the court has the option to make a composition proposal
to its creditors, under court supervision, in order to compose its overall indebtedness and/or reorganize its
business, thereby avoiding a declaration of insolvency and the initiation of bankruptcy proceeding (“Composition
_with Creditors,” so-called “concordato preventivo”). Such composition proposal can be made by a commercial_
enterprise which exceeds any of the following thresholds: (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate
amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, (ii) gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an
aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, and (iii) has total
indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million. Only the debtor company can initially file a petition for a concordato
_preventivo with the court based in the location of the company’s main office. The debtor shall submit the petition_
together with, inter alia, a restructuring plan containing an analytical description of manner and timing of the
fulfillment of the proposal and an independent expert report assessing the feasibility of the composition proposal
and the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company. Plans based on business
continuity further require the expert to certify that business continuity would be beneficial for the creditors. The
petition for concordato preventivo is then published by the debtor-in the companies’ register and communicated
to the public prosecutor. From the date of such publication to the date on which the court sanctions the
concordato preventivo, all enforcement actions, precautionary measures and interim relief actions by the
creditors (whose debt became due before the sanctioning of the concordato preventivo by the court) are stayed.
Preexisting creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized by the court), and mortgages registered
within the 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the concordato preventivo is published in the
company’s register are ineffective against such pre-existing creditors.

The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for: (i) the restructuring and
payment of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims (provided that, in any case, it will ensure payment of at
least 20 percent. of the unsecured receivables, except for the case of Composition with Creditors with continuity
of the going-concern (concordato con continuità aziendale) pursuant to Article 186-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy
Law, including through extraordinary transactions such as the granting to creditors and their subsidiaries or
affiliated companies of shares, bonds (also convertible into shares), or other financial instruments and debt
securities); (ii) the transfer to a receiver (assuntore) of the operations of the debtor company making the
composition proposal; (iii) the division of creditors into different classes, provided that each class is composed of
creditors having homogeneous legal positions and economic interests; and (iv) different treatments for creditors
belonging to different classes. The composition proposal may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the
partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.

In order to strengthen the position of the unsecured creditors, Law no. 132 sets forth that a Composition
with Creditors proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) (i.e., a pre-Composition with
Creditors proposal aiming at transferring all the assets to the creditors and having such assets sold in their interest
by the judicial commissioner) must ensure that the unsecured creditors are-paid in a percentage of at least 20% of
their claims. This provision does not apply to Composition with Creditors proposals based on the continuation of
the going-concern (concordato con continuità aziendale).

Under the Composition with Creditors there is no dispossession of the debtor who accordingly retains
management powers under the supervision of a court appointed official (commissario giudiziale) and the
delegated judge. From the date of the publication of the petition to the date on which the court sanctions the
_concordato preventivo, the debtor is entitled to operate in the ordinary course of its business, although_
extraordinary transactions require the prior written approval of the court. During this time, all enforcement
actions, precautionary actions and interim measures sought by the creditors, whose title arose beforehand, are
stayed (“Automatic Stay”). The accrual of interests is suspended for the same timeframe, except for claims

363


-----

secured by pledges, liens or mortgages. Pre-existing creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized
by the court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the
concordato preventivo is published in the companies’ register are ineffective against such pre-existing creditors.
Any act, payment or security executed or created after the filing of the concordato preventivo application and in
accordance with its rules and procedures is exempt from claw-back action. The debtor is also exempt from
certain bankruptcy crimes provided under Articles 216, third paragraph (“preferential bankruptcy”), and 217
(“simple bankruptcy”) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, in relation to acts and payments made in execution of the
Composition with Creditors and/or in relation to finance provided under Article 182-quinquies of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law upon judicial authorization. Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed
company and new super senior indebtedness authorized by the court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of
the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after
the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law
also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2 letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, aimed at
supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business as recently introduced by Article 1 of the
Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132, are treated as super senior (so called prededucibili) pursuant to
Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy.

The filing of the application for the concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary
and simplified petition for a concordato preventivo (so-called concordato in bianco, pursuant to Article 161,
paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, as amended by Law Decree No. 69 of June 21, 2013, as converted
into Italian Law No. 98 of August 9, 2013). The debtor company may file such petition along with (i) its financial
statements of the last three financial years and (ii) the list of creditors with the reference to the amount of their
respective receivables, reserving the right to submit the underlying plan, the proposal and all relevant
documentation within a period assigned by the court between 60 and 120 days from the date of the filing of the
preliminary petition, subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60-days, where there are reasonable
grounds for such extension (giustificati motivi). In advance of such deadline, the debtor may also file a petition
for the approval of a debt restructuring agreement (pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). If
the court accepts such preliminary petition, it (i) a may appoint a judicial commissioner (commissario giudiziale)
to overview the company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried out one of the activities under article 173
of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (e.g., concealment of part of assets, omission to report one or more claims,
declaration of non-existent liabilities or commission of other fraudulent acts), shall report it to the court, which,
upon further verification, may reject the petition at court for a concordato preventivo and (ii) sets forth reporting
and information duties of the company during the above-mentioned period.

The debtor company may not file such pre-application where it had already done so in the previous
two-years without the admission to the concordato preventivo having followed. The decree setting the term for
the presentation of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (relating also to the
financial management of the company and to the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of the
application and the restructuring plan) that the company has to fulfil, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse
of the term established by the court. The debtor company will file, on a monthly basis, the company’s financial
position, which is published, the following day, in the companies’ register. Noncompliance with these
requirements results in the application for the composition with creditors being declared inadmissible and, upon
request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the relevant requirements are verified, in the
adjudication of the distressed Company into bankruptcy. If the activities carried out by the debtor company
appear to be clearly inappropriate to the preparation of the application and the restructuring plan, the court may,
ex officio, after hearing the debtor and, if appointed, the judicial commissioner, reduce the time for the filing of
additional documents.

Following the filing of the preliminary petition for concordato in bianco or the full petition and until the
decree of admission to the composition with creditors, the distressed company may (i) carry out acts pertaining to
its ordinary activity and (ii) seek the court’s authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its non-recurring
activity, to the extent they are urgent. Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company
have super-priority (prededucibilità) in case of subsequent bankruptcy.

Pursuant to the new Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the court, pending the sanctioning
(omologazione) of the agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1, or after the filing of the moratorium
application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a petition pursuant to
Article 161, Paragraph 6, (in relation to the court supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors
(concordato preventivo) described below) may authorize the debtor, if so expressly requested, to (i) incur new
super senior (prededucibile) indebtedness subject to authorization by the court, (ii) secure such indebtedness via

364


-----

in rem security (“garanzie reali”), or by assigning claims, provided that the expert appointed by the debtor,
having verified the overall financial needs of the company until the sanctioning (omologazione), declares that the
new financial indebtedness aims to achieve a better satisfaction of the creditors and (iii) pay pre-existing debts
deriving from the supply of services or goods, already payable and due, provided that, the expert declares that
such payment is essential for the keeping of the company’s activities and to ensure the best satisfaction for all
creditors. In addition, according to the provisions of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132, the
aforementioned authorization may be given also before the filing of the additional documentation required
pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.Pursuant to Article 186-bis of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law, a concordato preventivo is based on business continuity (concordato con continuità aziendale)
if the proposal provides for: (i) the continuation of the business by the debtor; (ii) the sale of the business as a
going-concern; (iii) or the contribution-in-kind of the business as a going-concern to one or more companies
(even if newly incorporated). In these cases, the petition for the concordato preventivo should fully describe the
costs and revenue that are expected as a consequence of the continuation of the business as a going-concern, as
well as the financial resources and support which will be necessary. The report of the independent expert will
also certify that the continuation of the business is conducive to the satisfaction of creditors’ claims to a greater
extent than if such composition proposal was not implemented. The plan may provide a moratorium of up to
one-year from the granting of approval for the payment of creditors secured by pledges, mortgages and liens in
relation to pre-existing debts, unless the plan provides for the liquidation of assets secured by pre-emption rights.
Existing contracts, even if entered with governmental bodies, are not be terminated by admission to procedure.

Furthermore, the going-concern based arrangements with creditors can provide for, inter alia, the
winding-up of those assets that are not functional to the business allowed. The composition agreement may also
contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.

Under Article 182-quinquies, paragraph 5, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, a debtor who files for a
_concordato preventivo based on business continuity may request the court to be authorized to pay pre-filing_
claims relating to the purchase of goods or services if an independent expert certifies that they are essential for
business continuity and to ensure the best satisfaction of creditors.

If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice delegato) to
supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali) and calls a creditors’
meeting. During the implementation of the proposal, the company generally continues to be managed by its
corporate bodies, usually its board of directors, but is supervised by the appointed judicial officers and judge,
who shall authorize all transactions that exceed the ordinary course of business. The debtor is allowed to carry
out urgent extraordinary transactions only upon the prior court’s authorization, while ordinary transactions may
be carried out without authorization. Third-party claims, related to the interim acts legally carried out by the
debtor, are super-senior (so called prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

Article 163-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree No. 83, as amended by Law 132,
provides that, if the Composition with Creditors plan, pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law, includes an offer for the sale of the debtor’s assets or the sale of a going-concern of the debtor
to an identified third party, the court shall open a competitive bidding process by decree establishing the terms of
participation for the bidders. A bidder’s offer is irrevocable. If there is more than one improving offer, the Judge
shall open a new competitive bidding process between bidders. The debtor must reform concordato preventivo
proposal and plan in accordance with results of competitive bidding process.

If the plan filed by the debtor does not ensure the repayment of unsecured claims in an amount at least equal
to 40% of their nominal value (if based on liquidation) or 30% (if based on business continuity pursuant to
Article 186 bis), creditors holding claims representing at least 10% of the aggregate debt (even if the claims have
been assigned to the creditors after the filing of the concordato preventivo petition) may submit (within 30-days
prior to the scheduled hearing) a competing Composition with Creditors proposal (proposta concorrente),
alternative to the one provided by the debtor. These creditors are entitled to vote on the proposta concorrente
only if they are located in an independent class. The proposta concorrente setting out several classes of creditors
shall be submitted to the bankruptcy court in order to verify the accuracy of the criteria used in creating different
classes.

The concordato preventivo proposal is voted on at a creditors’ meeting and must be approved with the
favorable vote of (a) the creditors representing the majority of the receivables admitted to vote and, also in the
event that the plan provides for more classes of creditors, and (b) the majority of the classes. The Composition
with Creditors is approved only if the required majorities of creditors expressly voted in favor of the proposal.
Law 132 abrogated the implied consent rule under which those creditors who, being entitled to vote, did not do

365


-----

so and those who did not express their dissent within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of the creditors’
meeting are deemed as consenting to the composition with creditors. Under the current regime, creditors who did
not exercise their voting rights in the creditors’ meeting can do so (even via email) within 20 days of the closure
of the minutes of the creditors’ meeting and, after such term, creditors who did not exercise their voting right will
be deemed not to approve the concordato preventivo proposal. Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the
proposal of concordato preventivo unless and to the extent they waive their security, or the concordato
_preventivo provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets_
(such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of
their debt affected by the proposal. The court may also approve the concordato preventivo (notwithstanding the
circumstance that one or more classes objected to it) if (i) the majority of the classes has approved the concordato
preventivo and (ii) the court deems that the interests of the dissenting creditors would be adequately safeguarded
through the concordato preventivo compared to other solutions. If an objection to the implementation of the
_concordato preventivo is filed by at least 20 percent. or, in case there are different classes of creditors, by a_
creditor belonging to a dissenting class, entitled to vote, the court nevertheless may sanction the concordato
_preventivo if it deems that the relevant creditors’ claims are likely to be satisfied to a greater extent as a result of_
the concordato preventivo than would be otherwise be the case.

After the approval of the concordato preventivo proposal, dissenting creditors (or creditors belonging to a
dissenting class) representing 20 percent or more of the liabilities may file an opposition (opposizione),
challenging the economic convenience of the plan. In such case, the court has the authority to “cram-down”
dissenting creditors, compelling their acceptance of the plan, if it deems that the proposed treatment of their
claims is equivalent to what they would recover in a Bankruptcy scenario. After the creditors’ approval, the
bankruptcy court approves the Composition with Creditors and appoints one or more liquidators in order to
execute the approved plan, if it has to be realized by way of a transfer of assets. The court may grant special
powers to the judicial commissioner to implement the plan if the debtor does not cooperate, including by taking
all corporate actions required.

If the creditors participating at the meeting do not approve the concordato preventivo, the court may, upon
request of the public prosecutor or a creditor and after having ascertained the condition for declaration of
bankruptcy, declare the company bankrupt.

The terms and the performance of outstanding contracts are not automatically affected by concordato
_preventivo. However, pursuant to article 169-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the debtor may request the_
competent court to be authorized to terminate outstanding agreements (contratti ancora ineseguiti o non
_compiutamente eseguiti), except for certain agreements which are excluded from the scope of the above_
provision (e.g., employment agreements (rapporti di lavoro subordinato), preliminary sale agreements (contratti
_preliminari di vendita) and real estate lease agreements (contratti di locazione di immobili)). The request may be_
filed with the competent court at the time of the filing of the application for the concordato preventivo or to the
judge (giudice delegato), if the application is made after admission to the procedure. Upon the debtor’s request,
the pending agreements can also be suspended for a period of time not exceeding 60-days, renewable just once.
In such circumstances, the other party has the right to receive an indemnification equivalent to the damages
suffered for the non-fulfillment of the agreement. Such indemnification would be treated as an unsecured claim.

In the event of a breach of the Composition with Creditors plan or fraud, bankruptcy may follow, at the
behest of the bankruptcy court. If the Composition with Creditors is implemented, the debts are discharged and
the debtor may return to its usual operations (if the assets of the company are still in his possession). Claims
(including claims for repayment of loans) arising in the course of the implementation of the plan (whether before
or after approval, conditional upon the bankruptcy court confirming such priority in the decree of admission), are
granted the highest priority and must be paid in full.

_Concordato preventivo is compulsory for all creditors prior to the publication of the application in the_
companies’ register. However, creditors retain without prejudice their rights against co-debtors, guarantors of the
debtor and other joint and severally liable debtors.

**Debt Restructuring Agreements with Creditors Pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law**
**(Accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti)**

Under article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, a company that is in financial distress (i.e., facing
financial distress which does not yet amount to insolvency) or is insolvent may file before the bankruptcy court
an application for the validation (omologazione) of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di
_ristrutturazione dei debiti) (“DRA”) representing at least 60% of its aggregate outstanding debts, pursuing the_
rebalancing of its financial situation.

366


-----

An independent expert, directly appointed by the debtor, must assess the truthfulness of the debtor’s
business and accounting data provided by the company and declare that the agreement is feasible and, in
particular, that it ensures that the debts of the non-participating creditors can be fully satisfied within a 120 day
term from: (i) the date of sanctioning (omologazione) of the agreement by the court, in the case of debts which
are due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the sanctioning (“omologazione”) of the
debt restructuring agreement by the court; and (ii) the date on which the relevant debts fall due, in case of debts
which are not yet due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the sanctioning
(omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court.

The DRA must be published in the Italian companies’ register to become effective in respect of third parties.
Creditors and other interested parties may oppose the agreement within 30-days from such publication. The court
will, after having settled the oppositions (if any), validate the agreement by issuing a decree, which may be
appealed within 15 days of its publication.

The Italian Bankruptcy Law does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of the
DRA. The plan can therefore provide, inter alia, either for the prosecution of the business by the debtor or by a
third party, or the sale of the business to a third party and may contain, refinancing agreements, moratoria, writeoffs and/or postponements of claims. The DRA may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or
deferred payment of certain taxes.

**_The Key Features of a DRA_**

A by-law 60-days moratorium (automatic stay) applies starting from the date of publication of the DRA.
During the standstill period creditors cannot start or continue any interim proceedings or enforcement actions
over the assets of the debtor. Creditors cannot obtain any security interest (unless it is agreed in the DRA) in
relation to the pre-existing debts. The moratorium can be requested, pursuant to Article 182-bis, paragraph 6, of
the Italian Bankruptcy Law, by the debtor to the court pending negotiations with creditors (prior to the DRA’s
above-mentioned publication of the agreement) subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions. Such moratorium
request must be published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the date of publication.

The court, having verified the completeness of the documentation, sets the date for the hearing within
30-days from the publication and orders the debtor to supply to the creditors the relevant documentation in
relation to the moratorium. In such hearing, creditors and other interested parties may file an opposition to the
DRA and the court assesses whether the conditions for granting the moratorium have been met and, if the court
so determines, orders, that no interim relief or enforcement action may be started or continued, nor can security
interests (unless agreed) be acquired over the assets of the debtor, and sets a deadline (not exceeding 60-days)
within which the DRA has to be filed. The court’s order may be challenged within 15 days of its publication.
Within the same time deadline of 60-days, an application for the concordato preventivo (as described below)
may be filed, without prejudice to the effect of the moratorium.

No dispossession of debtor occurs in respect of a DRA. It is a court-supervised procedure, which can take
from a few months up to more than a year (the duration of the proceedings are generally influenced by
challenges). Creditors entering into the DRA are not required to receive the same treatment (i.e., they are free to
reject the proposal and to protect their interests otherwise) and no cram-down is applicable to third-party
non-adhering creditors, who shall be fully re-paid within the abovementioned terms.

The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015 modified the basis for calculation of the 60 percent of
the outstanding debtor’s debt threshold required for courts’ sanctioning of debt restructuring agreements (accordi
_di ristrutturazione dei debiti), easing the requirements with respect to financial creditors._

Pursuant to the new Article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as
amended by Law 132/2015, debtors whose financial indebtedness (i.e. debts with banks or other financial
intermediaries) is at least 50% of their total indebtedness are entitled to enter into debt restructuring agreements
obtaining the approval of financial creditors representing at least 75% of the aggregate financial claims of the
relevant category and ask the court to declare such agreement binding on the dissenting financial creditors
belonging to the same category (so-called “cram-down”), if they (a) hold claims not exceeding 25% of the
aggregate value of claims included in a consenting class, (b) have been duly informed of the negotiations relating
to the DRA and have been granted the opportunity to participate in good faith, (c) have received complete and
updated information on the economic and financial performance of the debtor and (d) are-paid an amount at least
equal to what would be recoverable according to feasible alternative scenarios. If the abovementioned conditions
are met, then the remaining 25% of non-participating financial creditors belonging to the same class of creditors

367


-----

are crammed down; however, crammed down creditors can challenge the deal and refuse to be forced into it, on
the basis of the lack of homogeneity of the classes of creditors. Similarly, a standstill agreement (convenzione di
_moratoria) entered into between a debtor and financial creditors representing 75% of that debtor’s aggregate_
financial indebtedness would also bind the non-participating financial creditors, provided that (i) they have been
informed of the ongoing negotiations and have been allowed to participate in such negotiations in good faith; and
(ii) an expert meeting the requirements provided under Article 67, Paragraph 3, lett. d) of the Italian Bankruptcy
Law certifies that the non-consenting banks and financial intermediaries have legal status and economic interests
similar to those of the banks and financial intermediaries which have agreed to the moratorium arrangement. The
banks and financial intermediaries which have not agreed to the moratorium arrangement may challenge it
(opposizione) within 30-days after having been notified of the moratorium arrangement.

Such debt restructuring agreements and standstill agreements will not affect the rights of non-financial
creditors (e.g., trade creditors) who cannot be crammed down and must be paid within 120 days if not
participating to a scheme.

In no case the debt restructuring agreement provided under article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law
or the moratorium arrangement may impose on the non-adhering creditors the performance of new obligations,
the granting of new over-draft facilities, the maintenance of the possibility to utilize existing facilities or the
utilization of new facilities.

Pursuant to Article 182-quater of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, financing granted to the debtor pursuant to
the approved debt restructuring agreement (or a Court Supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors
(concordato preventivo)) (finanza in esecuzione) enjoy priority status in cases of subsequent bankruptcy (such
status also applies to financing granted by shareholders, but only up to 80% of such financing). Financing granted
“in view of” (i.e., before) presentation of a petition for the sanctioning (omologazione) of a debt restructuring
agreement or a court supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (finanza ponte) may be granted
such priority status provided that it is envisaged by the relevant plan or agreement and that such priority status is
expressly provided for by the court in the context of the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring
agreement or the approval of the concordato preventivo. Same provisions apply to financings granted by
shareholders up to 80% of their amount.

Pursuant to the new Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the court, pending the sanctioning
(omologazione) of the DRA, or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis,
paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or of a petition pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law (concordato in bianco, described below) may authorize the debtor, if so expressly requested, to:
(i) incur new super senior (prededucibile) indebtedness subject to authorization by the court, (ii) secure such
indebtedness via in rem security (“garanzie reali”), or by assigning claims,, provided that an independent expert
appointed by the debtor, having verified the overall financial needs of the company until the sanctioning
(omologazione), declares that such new financings are aimed at greater creditors’ satisfaction (finanziamenti
_interinali); and (iii) pay pre-existing debts deriving from the supply of services or goods, already payable and_
due, provided that, the expert declares that such payment is essential for the keeping of the company’s activities
and to ensure the best satisfaction for all creditors. In addition, according to the provisions of the Decree
83/2015, as amended by Law 132, the aforementioned authorization may be given also before the filing of the
additional documentation required pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

Furthermore, according to the Article 182-quinquies, third paragraph of Italian Bankruptcy Law, pending
the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 of
the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis,
Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2,
letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the court may also authorize the debtor to incur in new super senior (so
call prededucibile) indebtedness, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business
(finanza d’urgenza). The company, while filing such request of authorization, is required to specify (i) the
purpose of the financing, (ii) that it is unable to otherwise obtain the required funds and (iii) that the absence of
such financing will entail an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the company. Such indebtedness is treated as
super-senior (credito prededucibile) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

The provision of Article 182-quinques of the Italian Bankruptcy Law applies to both DRA and to the
compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo) outlined below.

All the acts, payments and guarantees over assets of the distressed company executed and/or performed
according to a validated (omologato) DRA are exempt from claw-back actions (revocatoria fallimentare) in the
event of subsequent Bankruptcy.

368


-----

The exemptions from certain bankruptcy crimes provided under Articles 216, third paragraph (preferential
bankruptcy), and 217 (simple bankruptcy) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law apply, in relation to acts and payments
made in accordance with the validated DRA and/or in relation to finance provided under Article 182-quinquies
upon judicial authorization (in respect of concordato preventivo, see below). Such exemption would not apply in
relation to the financings obtained “in view” of a DRA (i.e., in order to file the DRA—so-called “finanza
_ponte”), provided under Article 182-quarter of the Italian Bankruptcy Law._

**Bankruptcy (fallimento)**

Bankruptcy (fallimento) is a court-supervised procedure for the liquidation of an insolvent company’s assets
and for the distribution of the proceeds. It results in the company’s dissolution.

A company is declared bankrupt when insolvent. Insolvency, as defined under the Italian Bankruptcy Law,
occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations with ordinary means as they come due. A
request to declare a debtor company bankrupt and to commence bankruptcy proceedings and the judicial
liquidation of the debtor company’s assets can be filed by (i) the debtor company itself, (ii) any of its creditors,
provided that the debts which become overdue during the pre-bankruptcy evidential phase of the procedure
amount to no less than €30,000, and (iii) in certain cases, by the public prosecutor.

The bankruptcy is declared by the competent bankruptcy court. The Italian Bankruptcy Law is applicable
only to commercial enterprises (imprenditori commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are met: the
company (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the
three preceding fiscal years; (ii) has had gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding
€0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million.

Upon the commencement of a bankruptcy proceeding, amongst other things:

   - the debtor is dispossessed and the administration of the debtor company and the management of its
assets pass from the debtor company to the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare), who manages
and disposes of the assets under the direction of the delegated judge. The debtor may no longer validly
act in-court as claimant or defendant in relation to the assets (Article 43 of the Italian Bankruptcy
Law). The bankruptcy receiver is vested with such powers upon the authorization of the delegated
judge. However, all pending proceedings in which the debtor is involved are automatically stayed from
the date the adjudication is issued and need to be re-initiated by or against the bankruptcy receiver;

   - the payments of all debts and liabilities of the debtor and all the acts, transactions, payments made or
received by the insolvent debtor and issuance of guarantees are immediately suspended and formalities
with third parties that have been carried out after the declaration of bankruptcy are not effective as
regards the creditors of the debtor (Article 45 of Italian Bankruptcy Law);

   - subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors are stayed and creditors must file claims within a
defined period. In particular, under certain circumstances, secured creditors may enforce against the
secured property as soon as their claims are admitted as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out
of the proceeds of liquidation of the secured assets, together with applicable interest and subject to any
relevant expenses. In case the sale price is not high enough to determine a full satisfaction of their
credits, any outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the
bankrupt’s other unsecured debt. The secured creditor may sell the secured asset only with the court
authorization. After hearing the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare) and the creditors’
committee, the court decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth the relevant timing in his or
her decision;

   - certain payments made, securities given or transactions entered into by the debtor-in a certain period
before the debtor’s submission to a bankruptcy procedure (varying from six-months to two-years) can
be set aside and clawed-back if certain conditions are met (Article 67 of Italian Bankruptcy Law);

   - as a general rule, the beginning of bankruptcy involves the cessation of all the activities of the company
with a view to a sale of all assets. However, the bankruptcy court may order that business operations be
continued whenever cessation could cause greater damage to the company, provided that the
continuation does not adversely affect the creditors of the bankrupt debtor. If the bankruptcy court
authorizes the continuation of the business (esercizio provvisorio dell’impresa del fallito), the
management of the business is entrusted to the bankruptcy receiver (who may in turn avail himself of
qualified third parties for this purpose); and

369


-----

   - the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the bankruptcy
declaration are suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over. Although the general
rule is that the bankruptcy receiver is allowed to either continue or terminate contracts where some or
all of the obligations have not been performed by both parties, certain contracts are governed by
specific rules provided for by Italian Bankruptcy Law.

The bankruptcy proceeding is carried out and supervised by a court appointed bankruptcy receiver, a deputy
judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee (comitato dei creditori). The bankruptcy receiver is not a
representative of any one of the creditors, but is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor for the
satisfaction of the creditors as a whole. The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with
statutory priority rights. The liquidation of a debtor can take a considerable amount of time, particularly in cases
where the debtor’s assets include real property. In this respect, Law no. 132 amended the relevant provision of
the Italian Bankruptcy Law which sets forth the requirements applicable to the liquidation procedure and as a
consequence the timing for the liquidation of a debtor is shortened. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for
priority of payment to certain preferential creditors, including administrative costs associated with the bankruptcy
proceeding and related to the receiver’s running of the company, Italian tax and national social security
contributions and employee arrear of wages or salary. Such priority of payment is provided under mandatory
provisions of Italian law (and, as a consequence, it is untested and it is unlikely that priority of payments such as
those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements would be recognized by an Italian
bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by applicable law). Unsecured
creditors are satisfied after payment of preferential and secured creditors, out of available funds and assets (if
any) as below indicated.

The following features of bankruptcy proceedings also merit mention:

   - Bankruptcy composition proposal with creditors (concordato fallimentare). A bankruptcy proceeding
can terminate prior to liquidation through a bankruptcy composition proposal with creditors. The
procedure is aimed at speeding up bankruptcy proceedings and is an alternative to a receiver
conducting the liquidation proceedings. Over time it has proved to be more efficient in terms of costs
and timing. The relevant petition can be filed by one or more creditors or third parties starting from the
declaration of bankruptcy. By contrast, the debtor or its subsidiaries are only permitted to file such a
proposal only after one-year following such declaration but within two-years following the decree
giving effectiveness to the liabilities account (stato passivo). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote
on the proposal of concordato fallimentare, unless and to the extent they waive their security or the
_concordato fallimentare provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of_
their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote
only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The petition may provide that secured
claims are paid only in part. If the proposal is approved, the delegated judge orders the bankruptcy
receiver to immediately notify the advocate of the approval in order to allow him to seek approval of
the plan and furthermore to notify the debtor and any dissenting creditors. In the event that opposition
is filed, the Bankruptcy Court, after having verified the regularity of the procedure and the outcome of
the vote, approves the in bankruptcy composition proposal by means of a decree which is final and not
subject to appeal.

   - The Italian Bankruptcy Law does not provide any guidance with respect to the content of a concordato
fallimentare; thus, it may encompass any kind of transaction to effect the liquidation of the assets of the
debtor (e.g., debt-equity swap, sale of assets, business assignments, etc.).

   - The proposal may provide for the division of creditors into classes (thereby proposing different
treatment among the classes), the restructuring of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any
manner. The concordato fallimentare proposal must be approved by the creditors’ committee and the
creditors holding the majority (by value) of claims (and, if classes are formed, also by a majority (by
value) of the claims in a majority of the classes). Final court ratification is also required.

   - Once approved, the concordato fallimentare is binding against all non-accepting creditors (cram-down).

   - Statutory priorities. The statutory priority assigned to creditors under the Italian Bankruptcy Law may
be different from the priorities in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other European
Union jurisdictions. Under Italian law, the proceeds from the sale of the bankrupt’s estate and
distributed according to legal rules of priority. Neither the debtor nor the court can deviate from the
rules of statutory priority by proposing their own priorities of claims or by subordinating one claim to

370


-----

another based on equitable subordination principles (as a consequence it must be noted that priority of
payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements may not be
enforceable against an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities
provided by law). The rules of statutory priority apply irrespective of whether the proceeds are derived
from the sale of the entire bankrupt’s estate or part thereof, or from a single asset.

- Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law establishes that proceeds of liquidation shall be allocated
according to the following order:

(a) for payments of “claims with super-priority” (crediti prededucibili). In general, claims are
considered to have super-priority when they are so qualified by a specific provision of law or
when they arise as part of the bankruptcy (i.e., claims originated in the insolvency proceedings,
such as costs related to the procedure). These claims are-paid-for the entire amount and before
other claims (secured, preferred, unsecured and subordinated). Examples of these claims are
bankruptcy receiver’s fees and costs; the costs of the sale of the assets; the rent for the debtor’s
offices after adjudication; employees’ salaries and social security payments relating to the period
after adjudication; attorney’s and other advisors’ fees. Such claims are satisfied in full (including
costs and interests) and before other claims (secured, preferred, unsecured and subordinated) with
the proceeds of the liquidation of movable and immovable debtor’s assets, according to their rank
(preferred, secured, unsecured), with the exclusion of the proceeds of the sale of assets subject to
other creditors’ security interests (mortgages and pledges), which are directed to payment of
secured creditors;

(b) for payment of claims that benefit from preferential treatment (crediti privilegiati in senso ampio
_or crediti prelatizi), which include creditors who hold a security interest (creditori ipotecari o_
_pignoratizi) and creditors who have a preference under law (creditori privilegiati in senso stretto),_
such as the claims of the Italian tax authorities and social security administrators and claims for
employee wages. As a general principle, creditors holding a security interest are satisfied from the
relevant assets to the exclusion of all other creditors, including secured creditors having a lower
rank (e.g., first mortgage over second mortgage). However, the Italian Civil Code contains very
detailed rules (Article 2745) regulating priority conflicts between secured and preferred creditors.
A mortgagee and a pledgee are entitled to satisfy their claims from the proceeds of the sale of the
encumbered assets. Any excess is available for distribution to other creditors (i.e., second
mortgages, preferred creditors and unsecured creditors). Where the relevant asset is insufficient to
satisfy its claim against the debtor, a creditor will rank as an unsecured creditor for the remainder;

(c) for the payment of unsecured creditors’ claims (crediti chirografari). Unsecured creditors have no
preference or security and will therefore be paid only if and to the extent any proceeds of the
estate remain after all other claims have been satisfied. Unsecured creditors rank pari passu among
themselves in the estate, in proportion to the size of their claims;

(d) for the payment of subordinated creditors’ claims (creditori postergati e subordinati).
Subordinated creditors have no preference or security and are subordinated by law or contractual
provisions. They shall be paid only if and when all the creditors with a higher rank have been paid
in full.

- Avoidance powers in insolvency. A fundamental principle of the Italian Bankruptcy Law is the equal
treatment of all creditors (“par condicio creditorum”), according to which, absent statutory priorities or
security right, no creditor may be paid a higher percentage of his claim than other creditors. A
consequence of this principle is not only that the payment of debts by the bankruptcy receiver are
strictly regulated, but also that all transactions effected by the debtor over the previous year (or, in
certain cases, over the previous six-months) are scrutinized and potentially unwound as preferential.

- Under Italian law, there are “claw-back” or avoidance provisions that lead to, inter alia, the revocation
of payments made or security interests granted by the debtor prior to the declaration of bankruptcy. The
key avoidance provisions include, but are not limited to, transactions made below market value,
preferential transaction, transactions made with a view to defrauding creditors or to advantage one
creditor. Claw-back rules under Italian law are normally considered to be particularly favorable to the
receiver in bankruptcy compared to the rules applicable in other jurisdictions.

- In a bankruptcy proceeding, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a claw-back period of up to either
one-year or six-months in certain circumstances (please note that in the context of extraordinary

371


-----

administration procedures—see below—in relation to certain transactions, the claw back period can be
extended to five and three years, respectively) and a two-year ineffectiveness period for certain other
transactions.

- The Italian Bankruptcy Law distinguishes between acts or transactions, which are ineffective by
operation of law and acts or transactions which are voidable at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/
court commissioner, as detailed below.

- Acts ineffective by operation of law. (i) under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject to
certain limited exceptions, all transactions entered into for no consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis
creditors if entered into by the bankrupt entity-in the two-year period prior to the insolvency
declaration. Any asset subject to a transaction which is ineffective pursuant to Article 64 of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law becomes part of the bankruptcy estate by operation of law upon registration
(trascrizione) of the declaration of bankruptcy, without need to wait until the ineffectiveness of the
transaction is sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may challenge the registration before the
delegated judge for violation of law, and (ii) under article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments
of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are deemed ineffective
_vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the bankrupt entity within the two-year period prior to the insolvency_
declaration.

- Acts and transactions that could be avoided at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/court
commissioner.

(a) The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below, may be
clawed-back (revocati) vis-à-vis the bankruptcy as provided for by Article 67 of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law and be declared ineffective unless the non insolvent party proves that it had no
actual or constructive knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered
into:

- onerous transactions entered into in the year preceding the insolvency declaration, where the value of
the debt or of the obligations undertaken by the bankrupt entity exceeds 25% of the value of the
consideration received by and/or promised to the debtor;

- payments of debts, due and payable, made by the debtor, which were not paid in cash or by other
customary means of payment in the year preceding the insolvency declaration;

- pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the year preceding the insolvency declaration
in order to secure preexisting debts which have not yet fallen due at the time the new security was
granted; and

- pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt in the six-months preceding the insolvency declaration
in order to secure which had fallen due.

(b) The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the vulnerability period or such other
period specified below, may be clawed-back (revocati) and declared ineffective if the bankruptcy
receiver proves that the other party knew that the bankrupt entity was insolvent at the time of the
act or transaction:

- the payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous transactions entered into
or made within six-months prior to the insolvency declaration; and

- the granting of a security interest for debts incurred within six-months prior to the insolvency
declaration.

(c) The following transactions are exempt from claw-back actions:

- a payment for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business according to market practice;

- a remittance on a bank account, provided that it does not materially and permanently reduce the
bankrupt entity’s debt towards the bank;

- a sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645 bis of the Italian Civil Code,
in force as at the date of this Offering Memorandum, made for a fair value and concerning a residential
property that is intended as the main residence of the purchaser or the purchaser’s family (within three
degrees of kinship) or a non-residential property that is intended as the main seat of the enterprise of
the purchaser, on the condition that, as of the date of the insolvency declaration, such activity is
actually exercised or the investments for the start of such activity have been carried out;

372


-----

   - transactions entered into, payments made and guarantees and security granted with respect to the
bankrupt entity’s goods, provided that they concern the implementation of a piano di risanamento (see
“Out of court Reorganisation Plans pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law (piano di risanamento)” above);

   - a transaction entered into, payment made or guarantee or security interest granted to implement a
concordato preventivo (see “—Court-Supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors
(concordato preventivo)” above) or an accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti (see “—Debt Restructuring
Agreements with Creditors Pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (Accordi di
ristrutturazione dei debiti)” above) and transactions entered into, payments made and security interests
granted after the filing of the application for a concordato preventivo (see above);

   - remuneration payments to the bankrupt entity’s employees and consultants; and

   - payment of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date, with respect to services
necessary for access to concordato preventivo procedure.

The limitation period for initiating claw-back action is three years from the declaration of bankruptcy or, if
earlier, five years from the act or transaction to be clawed-back.

In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the bankrupt
entity be declared without effect vis-à-vis the acting creditors within the Italian Civil Code ordinary claw-back
period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria). Under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor may demand
that transactions through which the bankrupt entity disposed of its assets to the detriment of such creditor’s rights
be declared ineffective with respect to such creditor, provided that the bankrupt entity was aware of such
detriment (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, that such
transaction was fraudulently entered into by the debtor-in order to cause detriment of such creditor’s rights) and
that, in the case of a transaction entered into for consideration with a third person, the third person was aware of
such detriment (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, such
third party participated in the fraudulent scheme). Burden of proof is entirely with the receiver.

Law 132/2015 also introduced new Article 2929 bis to the Italian Civil Code, providing for a “simplified”
claw-back action for the creditor with respect to certain types of transactions put in place by the debtor with the
aim to subtract (registered) assets from the attachment by its creditors. In particular, the creditor can now start
enforcement proceedings over the relevant assets without previously obtaining a Court decision clawing back/
nullifying the relevant (fraudulent) transaction, to the extent that such transaction had been carried out without
consideration (e.g., gratuitous transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so-called fondo
patrimoniale i.e.“family trust”). In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action can also be carried out by
the creditor against the third-party purchaser.

Finally, the EU Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the various national
rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the European Union.

**Extraordinary Administration for Large Insolvent Companies (Amministrazione Straordinaria delle Grandi**
**_Imprese in Stato di Insolvenza)_**

An extraordinary administration procedure applies under Italian law for large industrial and commercial
enterprises (the “Prodi-bis Procedure” or “Extraordinary Administration”). Prodi-bis Procedure, which is
regulated by Legislative Decree no. 270 of July 8, 1999 (“Prodi-bis Decree”), replaces the previous special
administration for large companies in a state of crisis (amministrazione straordinaria delle grandi Imprese in
_crisi), introduced by Law no. 95 of April 3, 1979 (“Prodi Decree”)._

To be eligible, the relevant company must be insolvent, but demonstrating serious recovery prospects. To
qualify for this procedure, the company must have employed at least 200 employees in the year preceding the
commencement of the procedure. In addition, it must have debts equal to at least two-thirds of its assets as shown
in its financial statements and two-thirds of its income from sales and services during its last financial year. Any
of the creditors, the debtor, a court or the public prosecutor may make a petition to commence an extraordinary
administration procedure. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts
and creditors’ claims largely apply to Extraordinary Administration. Preferential payment is granted to those
credits (even unsecured) accrued to allow the conduct of the company’s business activity.

The procedure is divided into two main phases: a “judicial phase” and an “administrative phase.”

   - Judicial phase. In the judicial phase, the court determines whether the company meets the admission
criteria and whether it is insolvent. It then issues a decision to that effect and appoints up to three

373


-----

(commissario giudiziale) to investigate whether there are serious prospects for recovery via a business
sale or reorganization. The judicial receiver files a report with the court within 30-days, and within ten
days from such filing, the Italian Ministry of Economic Development shall file an opinion on the
admission of the company to the extraordinary administration procedure. The court then decides
(within 30-days from the filing of the report) whether to admit the company to the procedure or to
place it into bankruptcy.

   - Administrative phase. Assuming that the company is admitted to the extraordinary administration
procedure, the administrative phase begins and an extraordinary commissioner(s) is appointed by the
Italian Ministry of Economic Development. The extraordinary commissioner(s) prepare(s) a plan
which can provide for either the sale of the business as a going-concern within one-year (unless
extended by the Ministry) (the “Disposal Plan”) or a reorganization leading to the company’s economic
and financial recovery within two-years (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Recovery Plan”). It
may also include an arrangement with creditors (concordato). The plan must be approved by the
Ministry of Economic Development within 30-days from submission by the extraordinary
commissioner(s). In addition, the extraordinary commissioner draws up a report every six-months on
the financial condition and interim management of the company and sends it to the Ministry.

The declaration of the state of insolvency produces certain immediate effects, such as the automatic stay of
all legal actions by creditors against the debtor’s assets and the freezing of the accrual of interest.

The effects of the admission to the Prodi-bis Procedure (administrative phase) are that the stay of actions
continues and claw-back actions become possible. Debts incurred in the continuation of the business generally
will have super-priority over any other secured and unsecured claim (prededuzione) pursuant to Article 111 of
the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

The unsecured creditors are exclusively represented by one or two members of the surveillance committee,
which has consulting duties. Creditors can file their proofs of claim and have a right to the distribution of
proceeds. Creditors can also oppose the declaration of the state of insolvency as well as the admission to the
second phase. Under Article 53 of Prodi-bis Decree, the rules established by the Italian Bankruptcy Law
regarding the creditors’ proofs of claim also apply to the Prodi-bis Procedure.

The Prodi-bis Procedure can at any time be converted into bankruptcy upon request by the extraordinary
commissioner, or even ex officio, if the procedure cannot be positively continued. At the end of the procedure,
upon request of the extraordinary commissioner or even ex officio, the bankruptcy court will declare the
conversion of the procedure into bankruptcy when either the sale of the assets has been not performed within the
term stipulated in the program, or the business has not recovered its ability to regularly perform its obligations.

Bankruptcy rules concerning criminal bankruptcy law and bankruptcy claw-back law applies to the
Prodi-bis Procedure. The claw-back “avoidance period” is extended up to three to five years for Intra-Group
transactions.

**Industrial Restructuring of Large Insolvent Companies Pursuant to Marzano Law (Amministrazione**
**_Straordinaria delle Grandi Imprese in Crisi)_**

Introduced in 2003, the industrial restructuring of large insolvent companies is also known as the “Marzano
_procedure.” It is complementary to the Prodi-bis procedure and, except as otherwise provided, the same_
provisions apply. The Marzano procedure is intended to be faster than the Prodi-bis procedure and is aimed at
saving and turning around large insolvent companies in order to preserve their value. For example, although a
company must be insolvent, the application to the Ministry of Economic Development can be made before the
court commences the administrative phase.

The Marzano procedure only applies to large insolvent companies that, on a consolidated basis, have at least
500 employees in the year before the procedure is commenced and at least €300 million of debt (including those
from outstanding guarantees). The decision of whether to open a Marzano procedure is taken by the Ministry of
Economic Development following the debtor’s request (who must also file an application for the declaration of
insolvency). The Ministry assesses whether the relevant requirements are met and then appoints the extraordinary
commissioner(s) who will manage the company. The court also decides on the company’s insolvency.

This procedure restructures the company’s debts and sells those assets that are not strategic or do not form
part of the company’s core business.

The debtor must apply to the Minister of Economic Development for immediate admission to the procedure,
while at the same time filing a petition with the bankruptcy court in order to confirm its insolvency status. It is

374


-----

the Minister, rather than the bankruptcy court, that has primary responsibility for supervising the procedure; the
bankruptcy court is requested only to confirm the company’s insolvency status and verify the lawfulness of the
proceeding with respect to the verification of claims. If the debtor is admitted to the procedure, other insolvent
companies in the same corporate group may also participate, even if they do not satisfy the relevant
requirements.

The extraordinary commissioner(s) has/have 180 days (or 270 days if the Ministry of Economic
Development so agrees) to submit a Disposal Plan or Recovery Plan. The restructuring through the Disposal Plan
or the Recovery Plan must be completed within, respectively, one-year (extendable to two-years) and two-years.
If no Disposal or Recovery Plan is approved by the Ministry of Economic Development, the court will declare
the company bankrupt and open bankruptcy proceedings. The Recovery Plan can provide for the satisfaction of
creditors’ claims through a composition, which must specify any conditions of its implementation and describe
any offered guarantees.

The extraordinary commissioner may bring claw-back actions for the benefit of creditors during the
implementation of a recovery plan. Bankruptcy rules concerning criminal bankruptcy law and bankruptcy clawback law applies to Marzano procedure. The claw-back “avoidance period” is extended up to three to five years
for intragroup transactions.

**Compulsory Administrative Winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa)**

A compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa) is only available for certain
companies, including, inter alia, public interest entities such as state-controlled companies, insurance companies,
credit institutions and other financial institutions, none of which can be made pursuant to bankruptcy
proceedings. It is irrelevant whether these companies belong to the public or the private sector. A compulsory
administrative winding-up is a special sort of insolvency proceeding in which the entity is liquidated not by the
bankruptcy court, but by the relevant administrative authority that oversees the industry in which the entity is
active. The procedure may be triggered not only by the insolvency of the relevant entity, but also on other
grounds expressly provided for by the relevant legal provisions (e.g., in respect of Italian banks, serious
irregularities concerning the management of the bank or serious violations of the applicable legal, administrative
or statutory provisions). The effect of this procedure is that the entity loses control over its assets and a liquidator
(commissario liquidatore) is appointed to wind up the company by the relevant governmental authority (e.g.,
Bank of Italy, Ministry of the Economic Development).

The debtor, the directors of an insolvent company, or one or more creditor(s) may apply to the bankruptcy
court. The bankruptcy court must seek the advice of the government agency responsible for supervising the debtor’s
business. The judge may initiate proceedings by declaring the debtor-insolvent. All legal actions by creditors against
the debtor are then stayed, with the exception of those aiming to ascertain the amount of any claim.

The liquidator’s acts as a public officer and his actions are monitored by a steering committee (comitato di
_sorveglianza). The powers assigned to the designated judge and the bankruptcy court under the other insolvency_
proceedings are assumed by the relevant administrative authority under this procedure. Unlike other procedures,
there is no delegated judge, as the procedure is mainly administrative in nature. The liquidator must review
claims and consider whether a composition is feasible. If so, he will prepare with the debtor a plan of repayment,
to be submitted to the creditors.

The effect on creditors of the forced administrative winding-up is largely the same as under bankruptcy
proceedings and includes, for example, a ban on enforcement measures. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy
proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to extraordinary administration
proceedings.

If a composition does not appear feasible, arrangements are made for the disposal of the debtor’s assets and
the distribution of proceeds among the creditors in the same order of priority as in bankruptcy.

**Interim Financing**

The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, introduced the possibility for debtors which have filed
a Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (concordato preventivo) (even pursuant to Article 161,
paragraph 6, of Italian Bankruptcy Law) or a debt restructuring agreement pursuant to article 182-bis of Italian
Bankruptcy Law (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) to also obtain judicial authorization to receive:

   - new and urgent interim financing with priority status (prededucibilità) in case of subsequent bankruptcy if
an independent expert certifies that such financings are aimed at greater creditors’ satisfaction
(finanziamenti interinali) (Article 182-quinquies, first paragraph, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law);

375


-----

   - urgent finance which is necessary for their business needs (finanza d’urgenza) without having to file a
certification issued by an independent expert. The relevant claims shall take precedence over the other
creditors’ claims in case of bankruptcy (crediti prededucibili). The debtor must specify the purpose of
the requested finance and declare that it is urgently needed and that the inability to access such finance
would cause imminent and irreparable damage. The Court shall decide on this request within 10 days
of the filing of the application after consultation with the judicial commissioner and, if deemed
necessary, the principal creditors. The debtor also has the possibility to obtain authorization to continue
to use existing trade receivables credit lines (linee di credito autoliquidanti) (Article 182-quinquies,
second paragraph, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law).

Before the entry into force of the Decree 83, debtors could be granted financing with priority status
(prededucibilità) before a court’s approval of a Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (concordato
_preventivo) or the entry into a debt restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) if: (i) an_
expert certified that such financing is functional to the overall restructuring process; or (ii) such financing is
provided for by the plan or the agreement, provided in each case that the court approved such priority status.

Super-priority rights granted pursuant to the above do not jeopardize or overcome the rights in rem (e.g.,
mortgages) of secured creditors.

**Hardening Period / Claw-back and Fraudulent Transfer**

In a bankruptcy proceeding, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a claw-back period of up to one year
(six months in certain circumstances). In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that
certain transactions of the debtor are declared ineffective within the Italian Civil Code ordinary claw-back period
of five years (“revocatoria ordinaria”).

Under Italian law, in the event that the relevant guarantor and/or security provider enters into insolvency
proceedings, the security interests created under the documents entered into to secure the Collateral and any
future security interests or guarantees could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or
by other creditors of such guarantor and/or security provider under the rules of avoidance or claw-back of Italian
Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or claw-back of transactions by the
debtor made during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect period”). The avoidance may relate to

(i) transactions made by the debtor within a suspect period of one year prior to the declaration of the insolvency at
below market value (i.e., to the extent the asset or obligation given or undertaken exceeds by one quarter the value of
the consideration received by the debtor), or involving unusual means of payment (e.g., payment in kind) or new
security granted with respect to pre-existing debts not yet due at the time the security is entered into after the creation
of the secured obligations, unless the non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency
at the time the transaction was entered into, (ii) security granted within six months prior to the declaration of
insolvency with respect to pre-existing debts due and payable, unless the non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no
knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into, and (iii) payments of due and
payable obligations, transactions at arm’s length or security taken simultaneously to the creation of the secured
obligations during the suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, if the bankruptcy receiver
proves that the creditor was aware of the insolvency of the debtor.

The transactions potentially subject to avoidance also include those contemplated by a Guarantee or the
granting of security interests under the Security Documents by a guarantor and/or security provider. If they are
challenged successfully, the rights granted under the Guarantees or in connection with security interests under the
relevant Security Documents may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the
insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the
benefit of the security interest and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related Security Documents.

It should be noted that (i) under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject to certain limited
exceptions, all transactions carried out by the insolvent debtor for no consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis
creditors if entered into by the debtor in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration and (ii) under
Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency
declaration or thereafter are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period
prior to insolvency.

In addition, as noted above, the EU Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the
various national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the European
Union.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) dated on
or about the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Issuer has agreed to sell to each EUR Initial Purchaser and
each such EUR Initial Purchaser has agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase all of the EUR Notes from the
Issuer, and the Issuer has agreed to sell to each USD Initial Purchaser and each such USD Initial Purchaser has
agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase all of the USD Notes from the Issuer. In the event that an Initial
Purchaser fails or refuses to purchase the Notes which it has agreed to purchase, the Purchase Agreement
provides that the purchase commitments of the other Initial Purchasers may be increased or that the Purchase
Agreement may be terminated.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept
delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they propose to offer the Notes initially at the offering price
listed on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum. After the initial offering, the Initial Purchasers may
change the offering price and any other selling terms of the Notes at any time without notice. The Initial
Purchasers may offer and sell the Notes through certain of their affiliates or through registered broker dealers,
including in respect of sales into the United States. To the extent that any Initial Purchaser that is not a U.S.
registered broker dealer intends to effect any sales of Notes in the United States, it will do so through one or
more U.S. registered broker dealer affiliates as permitted by guidelines promulgated by the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. Nordea Bank Abp’s ability to engage in U.S. securities dealings is limited under the U.S.
Bank Holding Company Act and it may not underwrite, offer or sell securities that are offered or sold in the
United States. Nordea Bank Abp will only underwrite, offer and sell the securities that are part of its allotment
solely to non-U.S. persons outside the United States. As OP Corporate Bank plc is not registered with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as a U.S. registered broker-dealer, it will effect offers and sales of the
Notes solely outside of the United States to non-U.S. persons. The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to
withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors and to reject orders in whole or in part.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other
charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price set
forth on the cover page hereof.

The Issuer has agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for their services in connection
with this Offering and to reimburse them for certain out-of-pocket expenses. The Issuer has also agreed to
indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the
Securities Act, or to contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect of
those liabilities.

The Sponsors or their respective affiliates may place a purchase order for and be allocated the Notes at a
purchase price per Note equal to the issue price set forth on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum,
subject to a pass through of the Initial Purchasers’ discount (ignoring any credit) in respect of the Notes
purchased by such persons.

Investment funds advised by entities affiliated with the Sponsors may purchase Notes in the Offering at a
purchase price per Note equal to the issue price set forth on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, and in
the case of investment funds registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940
Act”), subject to the 1940 Act. The Purchase Agreement between the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers will not
restrict the ability of the funds and the affiliates of the Sponsors to buy or sell the Notes in the future and, as a
result, these investment funds and affiliates of the Sponsors may buy or sell Notes in open market transactions at
any time following the consummation of the Offering.

We have agreed not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except as provided under the
Purchase Agreement, any debt securities of, or guaranteed by, the Issuer or any of the Guarantors that are
substantially similar to the Notes and having a tenor of more than one year during the period from the date of the
Purchase Agreement through and including the date falling 45 days after the closing of the Offering.

**New Issue of Notes**

Application will be made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange; however, there can be no
assurance that such listing will be obtained or, if obtained, maintained.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they presently intend to make a market in the Notes after
completion of this Offering as permitted by applicable law. However, the Initial Purchasers are under no

377


-----

obligation to do so and may discontinue any market making activities at any time without notice. In addition, any
such market making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.
Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, or that it will be liquid if it does
develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you,
if at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure—There may not be an active trading
_market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes will be limited.”_

**Price Stabilization and Short Positions**

In connection with this Offering, the Stabilizing Manager (or persons acting on its behalf) may purchase and
sell Notes in the open market. These transactions may include over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, syndicate
covering transactions and penalty bids. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates
a short position for the Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the Notes in the open
market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. Syndicate covering transactions
involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover
short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker/dealer
when the Notes originally sold by such broker/dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to
cover short positions. These transactions may be effected in the over the counter market or otherwise.

These activities may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the Notes. As a result, the
price of the Notes may be higher than the prices that otherwise might exist in the open market. Neither we nor the
Initial Purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the
transactions described above may have on the price of the Notes. In addition, there is no obligation on the
Stabilizing Manager to engage in such transactions and neither we nor the Initial Purchasers make any
representation that the Stabilizing Manager will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once
commenced, will not be discontinued without notice. Any stabilization action may begin on or after the date on
which adequate public disclosure of the terms of this Offering is made and, if begun, may be discontinued at any
time, but it must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the Issue Date and 60 days after the date of the
allotment of the Notes. Any stabilization action or over allotment must be conducted by the Stabilizing Manager
(or persons acting on its behalf) in accordance with all applicable laws and rules.

**Initial Settlement**

It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or around the date
specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be Business Days following the
date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+ ”). Under Rule 15(c)6-1
under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two Business Days,
unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the
Notes on the date of pricing or the two succeeding Business Day will be required, by virtue of the fact that the
Notes initially will settle in T+, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to
prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing should
consult their own adviser.

**Other Relationships**

The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities,
which may include securities trading, commercial investment banking, financial advising, investment
management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial Purchasers and/or
their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past and may provide in the future investment
banking, financial advisory, operational support and commercial banking services to the Issuer and its
subsidiaries and affiliates in the ordinary course of business for which they have received or may receive
customary fees and commissions. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial
Purchasers and/or their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and
equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own
account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities
and/or instruments of the Issuer (including the Notes), the Guarantors or their respective subsidiaries and/or
affiliates. Depending on market conditions, one or more of the Initial Purchasers may decide to initially purchase
a portion of the Notes for their own accounts, which could affect future trading of the Notes. Such Initial
Purchaser or Initial Purchasers may in the future resell all or a portion of such Notes from time to time.

378


-----

The Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates may, in the future, act as hedge counterparties to the
Issuer and its subsidiaries consistent with their customary risk management policies, and will receive customary
fees for their services in such capacities. Typically, such Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates would hedge
such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the
creation of short positions in securities, including potentially the Notes. Any such short positions could adversely
affect future trading prices of Notes. The Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates may also make investment
recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial
instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such
securities and instruments. The Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates have received, and expect to
receive, customary fees and commissions for these transactions.

The Initial Purchasers and/or certain of their affiliates are lenders under the Bridge Facilities in connection
with the financing for the Transactions and have received customary fees in connection therewith. A portion of
the proceeds from the offering of the Notes will be used to refinance the Bridge Facilities. Certain of the Initial
Purchasers and/or certain of their affiliates are holders of certain existing debt of the Group that will be repaid in
connection with the Transactions, and will therefore receive a portion of the proceeds of the Notes in connection
with the repayment of each such indebtedness as part of the Transactions and/or are, or will be, lenders or holders
of certain local lines, bank loans or other debt of the Group that will remain outstanding. See “Summary—The

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

_You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, sale, resale, pledge or other transfer of_
_any of the Notes and/or the Note Guarantees offered hereby._

The Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof (together, the “Securities”) have not been and will not be
registered under the Securities Act, any U.S. state securities laws, or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction,
and may not be offered or sold in the United States or to U.S. persons unless the Securities are registered under
the Securities Act, or an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and the securities
laws of any applicable jurisdiction is available. Accordingly, the Securities are being offered and sold only (i) to
qualified institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A, “QIBs”) in reliance on Rule 144A and (ii) to non-U.S.
persons outside the United States in an offshore transaction (in each case, as defined in Regulation S) in reliance
on Regulation S. Accordingly, we are offering and selling the Securities to the Initial Purchasers for re-offer and
resale only:

   - in the United States to QIBs in compliance with Rule 144A; and

   - outside the United States in an offshore transaction to non-U.S. persons in accordance with
Regulation S.

We use the terms “U.S. person,” “offshore transaction” and “United States” with the meanings given to
them in Regulation S.

Each purchaser of the Securities hereunder (other than each of the Initial Purchasers) will be deemed to have
acknowledged, represented, warranted and agreed with us and the Initial Purchasers as follows (terms used in this
paragraph that are defined in Rule 144A and Regulation S are used herein as defined therein):

(1) it understands and acknowledges that (i) the Securities have not been registered under the Securities
Act or any other applicable securities laws and that the Securities are being offered for resale in
transactions not requiring registration under the Securities Act or any other securities laws, including
sales pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act; and (ii) the Securities may not be offered, sold or
otherwise transferred except in compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act and
any other applicable securities laws or pursuant to an exemption therefrom and in each case in
compliance with the conditions for transfer set forth in paragraphs (4) and (5) below;

(2) it is either (a) a QIB and is aware that any sale of these Securities to it will be made in reliance on
Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and such acquisition will be for its own account or for the account
of another QIB, or (b) it is a non-U.S. person (and is not purchasing the Securities for the account or
benefit or a U.S. person) and is purchasing the Securities outside the United States in an offshore
transaction in accordance with Regulation S;

(3) it acknowledges that neither the Issuer, the Guarantors nor the Initial Purchasers, nor any person
representing any of the foregoing, has made any representation to it with respect to us or the offer or
sale of any Securities, other than the information contained in or incorporated by reference in this
Offering Memorandum, which Offering Memorandum has been delivered to it and upon which it is
relying in making its investment decision with respect to the Securities. It has had access to such
financial and other information concerning us and the Securities as it has deemed necessary in
connection with its decision to purchase any of the Securities, including an opportunity to ask questions
of, and request information from, us and the Initial Purchasers. It acknowledges that neither the Initial
Purchasers nor any person representing the Initial Purchasers make any representation or warranty as to
the accuracy or completeness of this Offering Memorandum or the information incorporated by
reference herein;

(4) it is purchasing the Securities for its own account, or for an account with respect to which it exercises
sole investment discretion and for which it is acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment,
and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of
the Securities Act or any state or other securities laws, subject to any requirement of law that the
disposition of its property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its
or their control and subject to its or their ability to resell such Securities to a QIB pursuant to
Rule 144A, to a non-U.S. person outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S or any other
exemption from registration available under the Securities Act, or in any transaction not subject to the
Securities Act;

(5) it understands and agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which it is
purchasing the Securities, and each subsequent holder of the Securities by its acceptance thereof will be
deemed to agree, that if in the future it decides to resell, pledge or otherwise transfer any Securities or
any beneficial interests in any Securities, it will do so prior to the date which is, in the case of
Securities offered to QIBs pursuant to Rule 144A, one year after the later of the original issue date of
such Securities, the original issue date of the issuance of any additional securities and the last date on
which the issuer or any affiliate of the issuer was the owner of such Security (or any predecessor of
such Security) only (a) to the Issuer, the Guarantors or any subsidiary thereof, (b) pursuant to a
registration statement which has been declared effective under the Securities Act, (c) for so long as
such Security is eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A, to a person it reasonably believes is a QIB
that purchases for its own account or for the account of a QIB to whom notice is given that the transfer
is being made in reliance on Rule 144A, (d) pursuant to offers and sales that occur outside the United
States to a non-U.S. person outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S or (e) pursuant
to any other available exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, subject in
each of the foregoing cases to compliance with any applicable state securities laws and any applicable
local laws and regulations, and further subject to the Issuer’s and the Trustee’s right prior to any such
offer, sale or transfer pursuant to clause (e) to require that a certificate of transfer in the form appearing
on the reverse of the Security is completed and delivered by the transferor to the Trustee.

##### Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s business and basis of preparation

**1 INFORMATION ABOUT AHLSTROM-MUNKSJÖ**

**General**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö is a global leader in fiber-based materials, supplying innovative and sustainable
solutions to customers worldwide. Our offerings include filter materials, release liners, food and beverage
processing materials, decor papers, abrasive and tape backings, electro technical paper, glass fiber materials,
medical fiber materials and solutions for diagnostics as well as a range of specialty papers for industrial and
consumer end-uses.

Ahlstrom-Munksjö Oyj, a Finnish public limited liability company with a corporate identity number,
2480661-5, is the parent company (“parent company”, “Ahlstrom-Munksjö Oyj”) of the Ahlstrom-Munksjö
Group (the “Group”, “Ahlstrom-Munksjö”). Ahlstrom-Munksjö is registered in Helsinki, Finland. AhlstromMunksjö’s registered address is Alvar Aallon katu 3 C, 00101 Helsinki, Finland. Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s shares are
listed on Nasdaq Helsinki and Nasdaq Stockholm.

**2 BASIS OF PREPARATION**

**Basis of preparation and accounting policies in our audited financial statements**

**Basis of preparation**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and
the interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee as approved by the Commission of the
European Communities (EU) for application in the European Union.

The following general principles have been applied to our financial statements:

   - The parent company’s functional and presentation currency is the euro (“EUR”) and financial
statements are presented in millions of euros (“EUR million”), unless otherwise indicated.

   - Financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments,
unlisted shares and interests and defined benefit pension plan assets, which are measured at fair value.

   - Non-current assets and non-current liabilities consist of amounts that are expected to be recovered or
paid more than 12 months after the reporting period. Current assets and current liabilities consist of
amounts that are expected to be recovered or paid within 12 months of the end of the reporting period.

   - All financial data in the financial statements have been rounded and consequently the sum of individual
figures can deviate from the total sum. Percentages are subject to possible rounding differences.

   - The accounting policies outlined in these financial statements have been applied consistently
throughout the Group and comparative information has been reclassified and restated where required to
ensure consistency.

**_Foreign currency translation_**

Figures representing the financial result and position of each subsidiary in the Group are measured using the
currency of the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates (the functional currency).

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates
prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies are
translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.

Foreign exchange differences arising from the currency translation are recognized in the income statement.
Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from operating business transactions are included in operating profit,
and those arising from financial transactions are included as a gross amount in financial income and expenses.
The foreign exchange gains and losses arising from the qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying hedges of a
net investment in foreign operations are recorded in the statement of other comprehensive income and
accumulated currency differences are recognized in equity.

F-10


-----

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2 BASIS OF PREPARATION (Continued)**

The balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries are translated into euros at the exchange rates prevailing at the
balance sheet date while the income statements are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
Translating the result of the period using different exchange rates on the balance sheet and income statement
causes a translation difference to be recognized in equity and its change is recorded in the statement of other
comprehensive income.

Translation differences arising from the elimination of the acquisition price of foreign subsidiaries and from
the translation differences in equity items since the acquisition date as well as the effective portion of hedging
instruments that hedge the currency exposures on net investments are recognized in the statement of other
comprehensive income. When a subsidiary is disposed or sold wholly or partially, translation differences arising
from the net investment and related hedges are recognized in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on
sale.

**_New reporting structure and the presentation of income statement_**

The Group has changed the presentation format for the Income statement based on function of expenses as
of January 1, 2020 to align with internal reporting. The comparative income statement information for the year
2019 has been restated and accordingly is unaudited. Previously the Group presented its Income statement based
on the nature of expenses. The Group made also certain minor reclassifications of the income statement items in
connection with adoption of the functional presentation. Certain items previously reported within Net sales were
classified to other income statement lines, such as operative exchange gains and losses as well as operative
foreign exchange derivative results. In addition, certain accounting policy alignments were made between Net
sales and Other operating income relating to the past acquisitions and the income from the sale of emission and
other environmental rights previously presented in Other operating expenses was reclassified to Other operating
income. As a result of these reclassifications, Net sales for the year 2019 decreased by EUR 1.0 million and
Other operating income for the year 2019 increased by EUR 8.6 million. The reclassifications have no impact on
Group’s operating result or net result for the year 2019. In the 2020 financial statements certain income statement
line items were renamed, such as net profit to net result and profit before tax to result before tax.

Ahlstrom-Munksjö implemented a new business and reporting structure as of January 1, 2020. The new
business areas are Filtration & Performance Solutions, Advanced Solutions, Industrial Solutions, Food
Packaging & Technical Solutions and Decor Solutions which form Group’s operating segments. In these
financial statements, the comparative segment information for the year 2019 has been restated accordingly and is
unaudited. More information is disclosed in note 4. In addition, the Group has reallocated goodwill to affected
cash-generating units, see note 12 for more information.

**_Expenses by function_**

Cost of goods sold includes costs of producing inventories that have been sold to third parties, delivery
expenses, impairment of inventories, repair and maintenance, operative exchange gains/losses including the
impact of the foreign exchange derivatives and general overhead expenses of Group’s Production and supply
function which are expensed as incurred.

Sales and marketing expenses include costs of selling products, customer service, marketing and
promotional expenses.

R&D expenses include the expenses of Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s R&D facilities and expenses related to
innovation and product development resources.

Administrative expenses include expenses of General Management, Finance, Corporate Strategy and
Development, Legal, Communications and Investor Relations, Human Resources and Information Systems
functions.

**_Tender offer for all Ahlstrom-Munksjö shares_**

On September 24, 2020, a consortium consisting of Ahlstrom Capital, funds managed or advised by Bain
Capital as well as Viknum and Belgrano Inversiones made a public recommended cash tender offer for all shares
in Ahlstrom-Munksjö.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2 BASIS OF PREPARATION (Continued)**

of EUR 0.13 per each outstanding share. In accordance with the announcement of the tender offer, the offer price
per share was reduced on a euro-for-euro basis as a result. Following the adjustment of the offer price, the price
offered for each share in the tender offer was EUR 17.97, subject to any further adjustments.

On October 16, 2020, the Board of Directors of Ahlstrom-Munksjö, represented by a quorum of
non-conflicted members, issued a statement regarding the tender offer, unanimously recommending that the
shareholders of Ahlstrom-Munksjö to accept the tender offer.

On October 22, 2020, at 9:30 a.m. (Finnish time) the offer period for the tender offer commenced, and it
was announced to expire on December 30, 2020, at 4:00 p.m. (Finnish time).

On December 8, 2020, the offeror decided to extend the offer period to expire on January 14, 2021, at 4:00
p.m. (Finnish time), unless the offer period was extended further or any extended offer period was discontinued
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the tender offer.

On December 17, 2020, the Board of Directors of Ahlstrom-Munksjö resolved on a dividend in the amount
of EUR 0.13 per each outstanding share. In accordance with the announcement of the tender offer, the offer price
per share was further reduced on a euro-for-euro basis as a result. Following the adjustment of the offer price, the
price offered was EUR 17.84, subject to any further adjustments.

For information about final result and completion of the public tender offer see note 24.

**_Impact of Covid-19_**

Due to continuing uncertainty around the Covid-19 pandemic, Ahlstrom-Munksjö has continued to assess
the impact on its business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. For Ahlstrom-Munksjö the
financial implications of the pandemic have been relatively limited so far. Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s 45 plants and
converting sites in 14 countries have remained operational during 2020, except for a few temporary shutdowns
caused by government lockdowns or employee absences related to quarantine or infections. Production has not
been interrupted to any significant extent due to raw material supply issues.

Within Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s broad range of advanced fiber-based solutions, the impact of the pandemic on
customer activity has varied. The pandemic has also created an exceptional situation globally and a strong
demand for healthcare goods in general, and particularly for protective medical products made from AhlstromMunksjö’s fabrics. Additional credit risk assessment has been implemented for customer receivables to evaluate
the potential implications of the Covid-19 pandemic. Based on the assessment, the Group has not identified any
significant increase in the amount of bad debt, and there has currently not been any significant change in
payment delays related to Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s customer receivables.

The pandemic has increased the risk of financiers becoming more cautious and reducing banks’ willingness
to provide financing. This may have an impact on refinancing and increase financing costs. Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s
liquidity continues to be good, and during the second quarter, the company has signed additional financing
facilities to further strengthen its liquidity position. There are no major short-term refinancing needs. The
company also proactively increased its financial flexibility by renegotiating its other financial covenant, net debt
to EBITDA. Please see more information in notes 17 and 19.

Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic, it is
difficult to predict how significant the impact of Covid-19, including any responses to it, will be on the global
economy and the business of the Group or for how long any disruptions are likely to continue. This has increased
uncertainty and management judgement related to cash flow projections. Ahlstrom-Munksjö assesses
continuously indications for impairment and carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities.

**_Adopted IFRS standards, amendments and improvements_**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö has applied the following standards and amendments for the first time for their annual
reporting period commencing January 1, 2020:

   - Amendments to References to Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards

   - Definition of a Business—Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations

   - Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions—Amendment to IFRS 16 Leases

The amendments and improvements listed above did not have material impact on the amounts recognised in
prior periods and are not expected to significantly affect the current or future periods.

The financial statements were authorised for issue by Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s Board of Directors on
February 9, 2021 and are expected to be adopted by the Annual General Meeting.

**Accounting estimates and judgements**

Due to the uncertainty around the Covid-19 pandemic, Ahlstrom-Munksjö has reviewed its estimates and
judgements used in the preparation of financial statements. The possible impact of the situation due to the
Covid-19 on the relevant factors in each estimate have been taken into consideration. The impact of the pandemic
on estimates in the financial reporting rely on managements best judgement under the current circumstances but
the end result will depend heavily on the duration and severity of the pandemic.

**_Notes disclosures_**

Notes to the financial statements include information required under IFRS to understand the financial
statements and is material and relevant to Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s operations, financial position and performance.
Information is considered material and relevant if, for example:

   - The amounts are significant because of size or nature;

accounting policies that relate to the financial statements as a whole, are disclosed above. New IFRS standards
and amendments or interpretations that will be adopted post-balance sheet date are described in note 23.

The fair values of acquired identifiable intangible assets at the date of acquisition were EUR 2.8 million
comprising of customer relationships.

The goodwill of EUR 5.2 million arising from the acquisition of converting operations is mainly attributable
to synergies. Acquired goodwill has been allocated to Advances Solutions business area. For more information
about goodwill allocation and our annual goodwill impairment tests, see note 12.

Acquisition related costs of EUR 0.3 million are included in other operating expenses in income statement
and in net cash from operating activities in cash flow statement.

The consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019, as though the acquisition date had been as
of January 1, 2019 were EUR 2,922.9 million.

**Accounting policies**

**Business acquisitions**

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the acquisition is
measured at the fair value of consideration transferred comprising of the following:

   - fair values of the assets transferred

   - liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquired business

   - equity interests issued as purchase consideration

   - fair value of any contingent consideration arrangement, and

   - fair value of any pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary, if applicable.

Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are,
with limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair values and any non-controlling interest in the acquired
entity on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**3 BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSALS (Continued)**

share of the acquired entity’s net identifiable assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and
presented as administrative expenses in the income statement with the exception of costs directly attributable to
the issuance of equity instruments that are deducted from equity, net of tax. Any excess of the consideration
transferred over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.

**Business disposals**

Gains or losses arising from the sale of business are recognized as other operating income or other operating
expenses. Intangible and tangible assets with definite useful lives are tested for impairment if there are indicators
of impairment, see more information on triggering events in note 12.

**Accounting estimates and judgements**

The application of the acquisition method requires certain estimates and assumptions to be made, especially
concerning the fair values of the acquired intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and the liabilities
assumed at the acquisition date, and the useful lives of the acquired intangible assets and property, plant and
equipment.

Measurement is based to a large extent on anticipated cash flows. If actual cash flows vary from those used
in calculating fair values, this may materially affect the Group’s future results of operations. In particular, the
estimation of discounted cash flows for e.g. customer relationships, technology based assets as well as
trademarks and tradename are based on assumptions concerning, for example:

   - Assumptions related to long-term sales projections and margin development

   - Determination of appropriate discount rates

   - Estimates related to customer retention rates

   - Estimates related to appropriate market based royalty rates

For significant acquisitions, the fair valuation exercise on the acquired assets and assumed liabilities is
carried out with assistance from independent third-party valuation specialists. The valuations are based on the
information available at the acquisition date taking into account the provisional adjustment period allowed under
IFRS of 12 months.

**Accounting policies**

**Business areas**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s CEO assisted by the Executive Management Team is the Group’s chief operating
decision maker (“CODM”) and operating segments are determined on the basis of information reviewed by the
CEO for the purposes of allocating resources and assessing the business area’s performance. The business area’s
performance is assessed internally based on net sales and comparable EBITDA. Comparable EBITDA is defined
for internal management reporting purposes as operating result before depreciation, amortization and
impairments and excluding items affecting comparability. Ahlstrom-Munksjö defines items affecting
comparability being material items outside ordinary course of business, such as gains and losses on business
disposals, direct transaction costs related to business acquisitions, costs for closure of business operations and
restructuring including redundancy payments, one-off items arising from purchase price allocation such as
inventory fair value adjustments, compensation related to environmental damages arising from unexpected or
rare events and other items including fines (such as VAT tax audit fines) or other similar stipulated payments and
litigations.

In addition to comparable EBITDA, the CODM also follows the business areas’ net asset position based on
the operating working capital which is defined as inventories plus operative receivables before factoring less
operating payables.

Sales between the business areas are invoiced at market prices. None of Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s individual
customers accounts for more than 10 per cent of the Group’s revenues.

**Revenue recognition**

IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers standard defines a five-step model to recognize revenue
arising from contracts with customers. The core principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity should recognize revenue
to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers an amount that reflects the consideration to
which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Under IFRS 15, an entity
recognizes revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied, i.e. when ‘control’ of the good or service
underlying the particular performance obligation is transferred to the customer.

The Group is delivering goods to the customers where each good provided to the customer is distinct from
the other goods provided to the customer. A typical good consist of a packed sheet of paper, a roll of paper or a
cube of pulp, which each represent a distinct performance obligation. The Group does not provide significant
amount of services. Sale of goods is the revenue stream of the Company that consists of the following business
areas: Filtration & Performance Solutions, Advanced Solutions, Industrial Solutions, Food Packaging &
Technical Solutions and Decor Solutions.

A typical contract with customer consists of purchase order and order confirmation, including the general
terms and conditions of the arrangement.

The Group provides standard assurance-type warranties only and consequently the customer contracts do
not include any service-type warranties that should be accounted for as a separate performance obligation.

The transaction price may include variable consideration components, including volume and cash discounts
and refunds. Revenue from these sales is recognised based on the price specified in the contract, net of the
estimated discounts and refunds. Accumulated experience is used and provide for the discounts and customer
refunds, using the expected value method, and revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is highly probable
that a significant reversal will not occur.

Revenue is recognised at a point in time when control of goods has been transferred to the customer based
on Incoterms.

**Repair and maintenance**

Ordinary repairs and maintenance activities are performed to maintain the plants and equipment in operating
condition. Ordinary repairs usually benefit only the period when such repairs are done and accordingly are
expensed in the period incurred.

**Cost of goods sold**

Cost of goods sold includes costs of producing inventories that have been sold to third parties, delivery
expenses, impairment of inventories, repair and maintenance, operative exchange gains/losses including the
impact of the foreign exchange derivatives and general overhead expenses of Group’s Production and supply
function which are expensed as incurred

**Other operating income**

Other operating income includes gain from disposal of assets, gain on sale of emission rights, sale of scrap
and side products and regular incomes, such as rental and lease income and gain relating to business disposals.
Other operating income includes also grants. Government grants are recognized in the income statement in the
same period as the costs they are intended to compensate. Government grants relating to the purchase of
property, plant and equipment are deducted from the cost of the assets and accordingly reduce the depreciation of
the underlying asset.

**Other operating expense**

Other operating expenses include depreciation and amortization arising from purchase price allocations
(PPA), impairment losses, losses from disposal of assets, bad debt allowances and other costs not directly related
to production, supply and sale of products.

**Related party transaction—the Board of Directors and the Executive Management Team**

There have not been any material transactions between Ahlstrom-Munksjö and its members of the Board of
Directors or the Executive Management Team or persons closely associated with these members or organization
in which these individuals have control or significant influence. There are no loans granted to any members of
the Board of Directors or Executive Management Team at December 31, 2020 nor December 31, 2019.

**Share-based payments**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s CEO, Executive Management Team members and a number of key employees
participate in share-based long-term incentive plans which are established on a recurring basis to align the
interests of the shareholders and management.

**Ahlstrom-Munksjö Long-term Incentive Share-based Plans**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s Board of Directors decided on October 24, 2017 to introduce a rolling long-term sharebased incentive plan for members of the Group’s key personnel with the aim of aligning the objectives of the
owners and key personnel to increase the Group’s value and to commit the key personnel to the Group. At the
end of December 2020, there are three ongoing performance periods.

In March 2019 the Board of Directors decided, in addition to the rolling long-term share-based incentive
plan on the establishment of a fixed matching share plan as well as on the establishment of a new restricted share
plan as a complementary share-based incentive structure for specific situations.

In February 2020 the Board of Directors decided to introduce a rolling Fixed Matching Share plan. and
establish a new earning period in the restricted share plan that was announced

**Rolling long-term share based incentive programme**

The rolling long-term share based incentive plan consists of a rolling structure of individual plans, each with
a three-year performance period. Below the list of the open performance periods at the end of December 2020.

   - Performance period 2018-2020 (“LTI 2018-2020”) was decided by the Board in February, 2018. The
performance conditions described below were not met and thus no reward will be paid out in 2021.

   - Performance period 2019-2021 (“LTI 2019-2021”) was decided by the Board in March, 2019. The
possible reward will be paid out in 2022 in the form of shares, provided that the below mentioned
performance and service conditions are met.

F-26

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**7 EMPLOYEE AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS REMUNERATION (Continued)**

   - Performance period 2020-2022 (“LTI 2020-2022”) was decided by the Board in February, 2020. The
possible reward will be paid out in 2023 in the form of shares, provided that the below mentioned
performance and service conditions are met.

**_Performance conditions_**

In order for the rewards to qualify for vesting, the following performance conditions will need to be met
over the performance periods.

Common for all the performance periods

   - Total shareholder return (TSR) is a market condition and is based on the share price at the end of the
performance period. This will need to exceed the minimum threshold set by the Board of Directors in
order for the condition to be met. A market condition is taken into account when estimating the grant
date fair value and therefore, the expense is recognised irrespectively of whether this market condition
is satisfied.

Performance periods 2018-2020 and 2019-2021

   - Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s cumulative comparable EBITDA over the performance period will need to exceed
an underlying comparable EBITDA requirement. This is a non-market performance condition. A
performance condition other than market condition is not taken into account when estimating the grant
date fair value. If the condition is not met, then it will result in a true up of the cumulative share-based
payment cost.

Performance period 2020-2022

   - Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s cumulative earnings per share (EPS) over the performance period. This is a
non-market performance condition. A performance condition other than market condition is not taken
into account when estimating the grant date fair value. The cumulative share-based payment cost is
trued up depending on the level of achieving the cumulative earning per share (EPS).

**_Service condition_**

In addition to the performance conditions, in order for the rewards to vest, the participant will need to be
employed by Ahlstrom-Munksjö at the time when the reward is paid.

Service condition as well as the probability of achieving the comparable EBITDA or earnings per share
performance criteria are used to calculate the annual expense and cumulative amount recognized in equity
relating the share-based payment scheme.

**Other long-term incentive share based plans**

**_Matching Share Plan_**

The Matching Share Plan is a one-off plan, which covers the years 2019-2021. A precondition of an eligible
individual’s participation in the plan is the individual’s personal investment in shares of Ahlstrom-Munksjö. In
the Matching Share Plan the participant will receive one matching share for each invested share free of charge
after an approximately three-year restriction period in the year 2022 provided that the participant continues to
own the invested shares and that the employment relationship of the participant with Ahlstrom-Munksjö still
continues.

Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s Board of Directors decided on February 13, 2020 to introduce a rolling Fixed
Matching Share Plan for members of the Group’s key personnel. Its first plan period covers the years 2020-2022.
A precondition of an eligible individual’s participation is a personal investment in Ahlstrom-Munksjö shares. In
the Matching Share Plan 2020 the participant will receive one matching share (gross before the withholding of all
applicable taxes) for each two invested shares free of charge after an approximately three-year restriction period
in the spring 2023. A precondition for the receipt of the share reward is the continued holding of the invested
shares and continued employment with Ahlstrom-Munksjö throughout the plan.

Service condition is used to calculate the annual expense and cumulative amount recognized in equity
relating the share-based payment scheme

**_Restricted Share plan_**

The Restricted Share Plan consists of annually commencing individual restricted share plans, each with a
three-year retention period after which the share rewards granted within the plan will be paid to the participants
in shares of Ahlstrom-Munksjö.

The commencement of each individual plan is subject to a separate Board approval. No individual plans
have been approved by the Board at the end of December 2020.

**Accounting policies**

**Share-based payments**

The long term incentive share based plans are accounted for as share-based payments whereby employees in
exchange for providing services receive Ahlstrom-Munksjö shares. Ahlstrom-Munksjö has classified these
programs as equity-settled as it is the Group’s intention to settle the rewards in the form of shares.

Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s share-based payments include both market and non-market performance conditions.
The Group calculates the grant-date fair value using a probability weighted value model to reflect the probability
of not achieving the TSR (market) conditions. The expense is recognized irrespectively of whether the conditions
are satisfied. The non-market performance condition and the requirement to stay in service are not factored into
the grant date fair value. If the non-marked performance condition or the service condition is not met, the
cumulative share-based payment cost will be trued-up accordingly.

The share-based cost related to equity-settled schemes is recognized by the Group under Employee benefit
expenses in the income statement. The total cost is determined by reference to the fair value at grant-date and is
recognized over the expected vesting period. At each balance sheet date, Ahlstrom-Munksjö revises the
cumulative share-based cost expected to be paid out based on the likelihood of achieving non-market
performance criteria levels and the estimated retention rate of participants at the end of the performance period.

The rewards will be settled by the Group, net of taxes that will be withheld. Net settled schemes are treated
as equity settled.

**Matching share plan**

The share-based cost related to the matching share plan is recognized under Administrative expenses in the
income statement. The total cost is determined by reference to the fair value at grant-date and is recognized over
the expected vesting period. The fair value is determined on the grant date. Expected dividends during the vesting

period have been deducted from the value of the share. The requirement to stay in service is not factored into the
grant date fair value. If the service condition is not met, the cumulative share-based payment cost will be
trued-up accordingly.

**Accounting estimates and judgements**

The long term incentive share based plans have been accounted for as equity settled share-based payments.
This is based on a judgment made by the Group that the plans will be rewarded in the form of shares and not
settled in cash.

The fair value of the long term incentive share based plans have been estimated at the grant-date based on
the probability of TSR reaching specific thresholds at the end of the performance period. In order to calculate the
probabilities, the most important assumptions that have been made in the probability weighted value model
comprise of required rate of return and annual TSR volatility.

The expense recognized in Administrative expenses is based on management’s estimate of the likelihood of
achieving the non-market performance criteria and the estimated number of participants remaining in the scheme
when the vesting period ends.

At the end of each period, management estimates the likelihood of achieving the non-market performance
criteria and the expected retention rate for participants in order to calculate the expense for the current period and
the change in the amount recognised in equity. In order to estimate the likelihood for achieving the non-market
performance criteria management considers the Group’s non-market performance criteria against the target to
date and the forecast for the remainder of the performance period.

Management estimate the number of participants that they expect to remain in the scheme at the end of the
vesting period by reviewing the number of participants remaining at the end of each period, and the expected
number of these participants who will remain at the pay-out date, considering the historic rate of staff retention in
the Group.

**8 DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT**

Intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets (“ROU assets”) are stated in the

**Impairment losses**
In 2020 impairment losses totalled to EUR -9.2 million. Impairment losses recognized relates to an old gas
turbine in Turin, Italy that was replaced (EUR -4.2 million), to property, plant and equipment in Stenay plant in
France that is facing increased competition (EUR -4.0 million) and a right-of-use asset office building in Sweden
that is no longer in use (EUR -1.1 million). In 2019 an impairment loss of EUR -2.4 million was recognized in
relation to the divestment of Mikkeli plant.

**Accounting policies**

Depreciation and amortization is recognized in the income statement on a straight-line basis based on
estimated useful life of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and ROU assets, adjusted in appropriate
cases by impairments. The useful lives are estimated as the period over which the Group will derive a benefit
from the asset.

Goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are considered as non-depreciable assets.
For non-depreciable assets, impairment tests are performed annually, as well as if there are any indications of
impairments during the year, by calculating the assets recovery value. For more information on the impairment of
goodwill and other intangible assets see note 12.

**Accounting policies**

**Current and deferred tax expense**

The income tax expense is comprised of current tax and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income
statement except when underlying transactions are reported in other comprehensive income, or directly in equity,
in which case the associated tax effect is reported in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

Current taxes are based on the results of group companies and are calculated using the local tax laws and tax
rates that are enacted or substantively enacted as of each reporting date. The Group files tax returns in several
jurisdictions and evaluates regularly tax positions taken. Tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions are recognized
when it is considered that certain tax positions will be challenged or have already been challenged by tax
authorities. Deferred tax is calculated using the liability method on temporary differences between the carrying
amounts and taxable values of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is not recognised for temporary differences that
arise on initial recognition of goodwill or the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction other than
a business combination that do not affect either the accounting or taxable profit at the time of the transaction.

Deferred tax is not recognized for temporary differences that arise on investments in subsidiaries where the
reversal is in the Group’s control and not expected in the foreseeable future.

The valuation of deferred tax provided is based on how carrying amounts of assets or liabilities are expected
to be realized or settled. Deferred tax is calculated by applying the tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at
the reporting date.

Deferred tax assets for tax-deductible temporary differences and loss carry forwards are recognized only to
the extent it is likely that they will be utilized.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legal right to offset current tax assets and
liabilities, and when the deferred tax assets and tax liabilities are attributable to taxes charged by the same tax

authority and relate to either the same tax entities or different tax entities, where there is an intention to settle the
balances on a net basis.

**Accounting estimates and judgements**

The utilization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and generation of
future taxable profits. The Group estimates possibilities to use deferred tax assets based on current business
plans. The Group periodically evaluates status of ongoing tax audits and disputes and positions taken in tax
returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It makes a
revaluation of the amounts recorded, where appropriate, on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax
authorities. Because the Group operates in complex international tax environment, significant degree of
judgement is used in identifying outcomes of tax audits and disputes and uncertain tax positions.

**Goodwill**

The carrying value of goodwill amounted to EUR 608.9 million (EUR 642.7 million) as of December 31,
2020.

Ahlstrom-Munksjö is organized into five business areas which are Filtration & Performance Solutions,
Advanced Solutions, Industrial Solutions, Food Packaging & Technical Solutions and Decor Solutions.
Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s business areas are described below. These five business areas form the Group’s operating
and reportable segments. Goodwill is allocated to the business areas reflecting their share of the deemed fair
values of the acquired assembled workforce, expected synergies and other benefits. These five business areas
correspond to the groups of cash-generating units (CGU) and the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for
internal management purposes. See note 4 for business area information.

As a result of implementing a new business and reporting structure as of January 1, 2020 the Group has
reallocated goodwill to affected groups of CGUs. The following table presents the allocation of goodwill to
Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s new business areas (groups of CGUs) and is not comparable to goodwill allocation
presented for comparative year. The reallocation was performed using a relative value approach.

The following tables present the allocation of goodwill to Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s business areas (groups of
CGUs) as of the annual impairment testing date:

**Impairment tests for goodwill**

The recoverable amounts of each group of cash-generating units are determined using a discounted cash
flow model (value-in-use). Key assumptions used in the determination include short-term and long-term growth
rate for net sales, development of EBITDA, annual capital expenditure, changes in operative working capital and
pre-tax discount rate.

The cash flows are based on business plans approved by the Board of Directors covering a period of three
years. The impact of Covid-19 on the future cash flows is insignificant. Cash flows beyond this three-year period
are based on the terminal value and have been extrapolated using an estimated long-term sales growth rate of
2.0% considering inflation. All cash flow projections reflect the past performance of the Group’s business
operations and management expectations for future market development considering the external sources of
information when available.

The discount rate used in the calculation is based on weighted average cost of capital (WACC) based on the
market view of the time-value of money and reflect specific risks related to each business area. In the weighted
average cost of capital (WACC) management has included an alfa factor amounting to 2.0% to mitigate the risks
related to the future cash flow projections and to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic.

The impairment tests for 2020 indicated that the recoverable amount of the groups of CGUs exceeded their
carrying value and goodwill is not been impaired.

Goodwill impairment tests for 2019 did not result in a recognition of any impairment.

**Sensitivity analysis**
As a part of the performance reviews, management has performed sensitivity analysis regarding the key
assumptions. The parameters used in the impairment tests, which were the most sensitive for changes were
EBITDA margin and pre-tax discount rate. The table below shows the percentage change in the key parameters
used in the calculations that would result in the value in use being equal to the carrying value (keeping other
parameters constant). The recoverable amount of the assets tested in 2020 exceeds their carrying value by EUR
1,744.5 million for Filtration & Performance Solutions, EUR 606.1 million for Advanced Solutions, EUR
520.0 million for Industrial Solutions, EUR 552.3 million for Food Packaging & Technical Solutions and EUR
203.0 million for Decor Solutions.

Management has considered and assessed reasonable possible changes for other key assumptions and has
not identified any instances that would result in a carrying amount that exceed the recoverable amount of the
groups of CGUs.

**Research and development**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö has product and process development activities focusing mainly on meeting customer
requirements in relation to product properties and adaptations. Research and development costs are expensed
except those development expenses that meet the capitalization criteria. In 2020 development costs that met
capitalization criteria and were capitalized amounted to EUR 6.2 million (EUR 6.5 million).

**Emission rights**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö participates in the European Union emission trading scheme in which it has received
free emission allowances for a defined period. Ahlstrom-Munksjö was granted 379,597 units (401,096 units) of
CO2 emission rights for the year 2020. The rights in excess of the Group’s needs have been transferred to 2021.
As of December 31, 2020, the remaining CO2 credits amounted to 30,850 units (98,841 units) and their market
value was approximately EUR 1.0 million (EUR 2.5 million).

In 2020, Ahlstrom-Munksjö did not sell or buy any emission rights. During the year 2019 AhlstromMunksjö sold emission rights amounting to EUR 2.3 million but didn’t buy any.

**Accounting policies**

**Intangible assets**

_Goodwill_

Goodwill arises from business combinations and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over
the Group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired at the acquisition date. Goodwill is an
intangible asset with an indefinite useful life. It is not amortized, but it is subject to impairment testing annually,
or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired.

For impairment testing purposes, goodwill is allocated to groups of cash-generating units reflecting the
lowest levels at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. A cash-generating unit, as
determined for the purposes of the impairment testing, is the smallest group of assets generating separately
identifiable cash inflows, which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets
(cash-generating units). The carrying value of a cash generated unit includes its share of relevant corporate assets
allocated to it on a reasonable and consistent basis.

Ahlstrom-Munksjö conducts its impairment testing by determining the recoverable amount for a group of
CGUs. The recoverable amount is defined as value-in-use according to a present value of the estimated future
cash flows. The recoverable amount is compared to the group of CGUs’ carrying value. If the carrying value
exceeds the recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
If an impairment loss is recognized, the loss is first allocated to reduce goodwill and then to reduce other assets.

Impairment is recognized as an expense in the income statement. An impairment loss recognized for
goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.

_Other intangible assets_

Customer relationships, patents and trademarks, technology related assets and other intangible assets
acquired in business combinations are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date and are subsequently
amortized on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives.

Computer software and separately acquired patents and trademarks are recorded at historical cost and
amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives.

Other intangible assets with definite useful lives are tested for impairment if there are indicators of
impairment, see more information on triggering events in Accounting policy of Property, plant and equipment.

_Research and development_

Ahlstrom-Munksjö has product and process development activities focusing mainly on meeting customer
requirements in relation to product properties and adaptations. Activities are divided into a research phase and a
development phase. Research costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in the income statement. Expenditures
on development activities are also expensed as incurred except those development expenses that meet the
capitalization criteria. Development costs arising from the development of new or significantly improved
products are capitalized as intangible assets when the costs of the development stage can be reliably determined,

**ASSETS (Continued)**

the product is technically feasible and economically viable, the product is expected to produce economic benefits
and the Group has the intention and the required resources to complete the development effort. Capitalized
development costs include the costs of material, labour and testing that are directly attributable to creating,
producing and preparing the asset to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
Amortization period for capitalized development costs is 10 years.

_Emission rights_

Ahlstrom-Munksjö participates in the European Union’s Emissions Trading Scheme aimed at reducing
greenhouse gas emission and receives allowances for a defined period to emit a fixed tonnage carbon dioxide.
The Group receives allowances either free of charge from the scheme or acquires them from other participants.
The allowances received and the liability based on the actual emissions are netted. A provision is recognized if
the allowances received do not cover the actual emissions. No intangible asset is recognized for the excess of
allowances. Gains arising from the sale of the emission right allowances are recorded in other operative income
in the income statement.

**Accounting estimates and judgements**

**Key assumptions used in goodwill impairment testing**

The management makes significant estimates and judgements in determining the level at which the goodwill
is tested and whether there are any indications of impairment.

The calculations of the value-in-use are based on cash flow projections, which require assessments and
estimates from the management. The most significant estimates concern development of net sales and EBITDA
including estimates for market prices of pulp and cost levels of main raw materials and energy as well as
determination of the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) used to discount cash flows. Management tests
the impacts of changes in significant estimates used in forecasts by sensitivity analyses as described above in this
note.

The covid-19 has increased the uncertainty related to the cash flow projections as the final impact will
depend on the duration and the severity of the virus. In the weighted average cost of capital (WACC)
management has included an alfa factor amounting to 2.0% to mitigate the risks related to the future cash flow
projections and to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic.

**Estimates and judgements related to other intangible assets**

For more information on the estimation of useful economic life of an intangible asset, see note 8.

**Property, plant and equipment**

**_Impairment of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets_**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö assesses the recoverability of the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and
intangible assets with definite useful lives if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
may be impaired (a triggering event). Factors that the Group considers when it reviews indicators of impairment
include, but are not limited to:

   - Observable indications for decrease in value

   - Significant adverse changes that have taken place in the technological, market, economic or legal
environment

   - Increases in interest rates

   - Obsolescence or physical damage affecting the asset

   - Deterioration in the expected level of the asset’s performance or adverse changes impacting the way
the asset is used or expected to be used

   - Where management’s own forecasts of future net cash inflows or operating profits show a significant
decline from previous budgets and forecasts

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**12** **INTANGIBLE** **ASSETS,** **PROPERTY,** **PLANT** **AND** **EQUIPMENT** **AND** **RIGHT-OF-USE**
**ASSETS (Continued)**

The carrying amount of an asset is written down immediately to the asset’s recoverable amount if the
carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is determined as the higher of an asset’s
fair value less costs to sell or its value-in-use. Value-in-use is determined by discounting future cash flows
expected to be generated by the asset. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest
level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating unit).

The impairment of assets is reversed if there is an indication that it is no longer necessary, and there has
been a change in the assumptions which formed the basis of the calculation of the recoverable amount. A reversal
is only made to the extent that the asset’s carrying value after reversal does not exceed the carrying value that the
asset would have had, with a deduction for depreciation, if no impairment had been carried out.

**_Property, plant and equipment_**

Land and land improvements include the Group’s freehold land and the landfills that the Group operates at
or near certain of its facilities in the United States. The operation of these landfills require state, federal and local
permits for construction, operation and closure and the landfills are subject to constructing final capping and
continued monitoring.

The freehold land and land improvements are recognized at cost. The cost of land improvements include the
cost of landfill preparation and excavation, construction of liners, related costs for environmental permits and
studies and the initial estimate to close, cap and care the landfill, for which the Group has made the
environmental provision (see note 16).

Property, plant and equipment are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment.
The cost includes the purchase price and expenditure directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and
condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended. Interest on borrowings directly
attributable to the purchase, construction or production of assets that take considerable time to complete are
capitalized.

Property, plant and equipment comprising parts with different useful lives are treated as separate
components of the asset. The costs incurred for replacing the part are recognized in the carrying amount of the
asset which is depreciated over the useful life of replacement. The carrying value of a property, plant and
equipment is derecognized from the balance sheet on scrapping or sale, or when no future economic benefits are
expected from use of the asset. Ordinary repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

Gains or losses arising from the sale of property, plant and equipment are recognized as other operating
income or other operating expenses.

**_Government grants_**

Government grants are recognized at fair value when there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be
received. Government grants relating to the purchase of property, plant and equipment are deducted from the cost
of the assets and accordingly reduce the depreciation of the underlying asset. Other government grants are
recognized in the income statement in the same period as the costs they are intended to compensate unless the
grant compensates an item which has been expensed in prior years.

**_Right-of-use assets_**

The measurement of the right-of-use asset and the lease liability is determined by discounting the minimum
future lease payments. Ahlstrom-Munksjö initially measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease
payments to be made over the lease term. The payments are based on the lease contracts and respective payment
schedules. Non-lease components, such as maintenance rents and other variable components are separated from
the lease liability and expensed if the non-lease components are specified in the agreement. Open ended lease
contracts and extension options are taken into account using management’s best estimate, e.g. end date for open
ended lease contracts is the most likely end date for the contracts and the extension option is included if it is
reasonably certain that the extension option will be exercised. Right-of-use asset is initially measured equal to the

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**12** **INTANGIBLE** **ASSETS,** **PROPERTY,** **PLANT** **AND** **EQUIPMENT** **AND** **RIGHT-OF-USE**
**ASSETS (Continued)**

lease liability and adjusted if payments relating to agreement are done in advance or there are initial costs for the
agreement. Right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment (IAS 36). The lease payments are discounted using
the interest rate implicit in the lease or the incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing rate comprises
the reference rate and credit spread for incremental borrowing. Factors affecting the incremental borrowing rate
include the length of the contract and potential premiums for country and currency risks. The revised incremental
borrowing rate is used when there are changes in the lease term, changes in assessment of an option to purchase
the asset and modifications to the lease that are not accounted as a separate lease. A change in index or such
expected changes do not result in a revised discount rate.

After the commencement date according to IFRS 16 the following applies: lease liabilities are reduced by
lease amortization and remeasurements are made to reflect changes to the lease payments; rights-of-use assets are
measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses adjusted for remeasurements
of the lease liability.

Payments of short-term leases with a maturity less than 12 months, leases of low-value assets and variable
lease payments are not included in the measurement of the lease liability nor right-of-use asset and are presented
in cost of goods sold, sales and marketing, R&D and administrative expenses in the income statement.

**Accounting estimates and judgements**

**Estimates and judgements related to property, plant and equipment as well as other intangible assets**

The Group has tangible and other intangible assets with definite useful lives which values are presented
above. The assets are tested for impairment when there are events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value may be impaired (a triggering event). The recoverability of these assets is based on market
assumptions and managements estimate of future cash flows. Changes in assumptions and failure to meet certain
earnings targets could result in impairment. Management has considered the triggering events due to Covid-19
pandemic and other events and tested the assets for impairment accordingly. For impairment testing see more
details in note 8.

**Estimates and judgements related to right-of-use assets**

The Group has open ended lease contracts and contacts with extension options. Management uses their best
estimate according to the existing information available to evaluate the most likely end date for these types of
contracts. Changes in the estimated end dates impact the amount of right-of-use asset and lease liability booked
in the balance sheet.

**13 INVENTORIES**

Inventories consist of products from the Group’s five business areas—Filtration & Performance Solutions,
Advanced Solutions, Industrial Solutions, Food Packaging & Technical Solutions and Decor Solutions—in

**13 INVENTORIES (Continued)**

**Accounting policies**

Inventories are recognized at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is calculated as
the selling price less costs attributable to the sale.

The methodology for determining the cost of inventories varies depending on the inventory class.

**Materials and supplies**

Materials and supplies are valued using the weighted average cost method. Under the weighted average cost
method, the cost of each items remaining in inventories at the period end is determined from the weighted
average of the cost of similar items at the beginning of the period and the cost of similar items purchased during
the period.

**Finished products and Work in progress**

Finished products and work in progress are valued on a first-in, first-out basis. Costs comprise all costs that
are directly attributable to the manufacturing process, including direct material and labour, and production related
overheads (based on normal operating capacity and normal consumption of material, labour and other production
costs) and depreciation charges.

**Accounting estimates and judgements**

**Inventory obsolescence**

If the net realizable value of inventory is deemed lower than the cost, then allowance is established for
inventory obsolescence. The amount to be allocated to inventory obsolescence is based on an estimation of the
net realizable value of inventory.

**Accounting policies**

**Trade and other receivables**

Trade and other receivables are recognized at amortized cost, using the effective interest rate method, less
any impairment losses, with the exception of fair value of unrealized hedges whose treatment is discussed in note
19. The credit quality of receivables that are neither past due nor impaired has been deemed sufficient and
payments are expected to be received when the receivables are due. Any changes to the allowance for doubtful
accounts receivable are recognized as an expense in the income statement.

The Group applies the simplified approach to assess the credit risk of trade receivables. The loss allowance
is measured at the estimate of the lifetime expected credit losses. The Group uses loss allowance provision matrix
to determine the expected credit loss rates. It considers historical loss rates for each ageing category and region.
The calculated loss percentage is then adjusted with the forward looking macroeconomic data. For trade
receivables not due or maximum 180 days overdue, a loss allowance of 0.0%-10.0% is made. The trade
receivables, which are overdue 181-360 days a loss allowance of 60.0% will be made and for more than 360 days
a loss allowance of 100.0 % will be made. The trade receivables are partly insured and the amount that will be
received from the insurer is excluded from the calculation of the trade receivables impairment

**Trade and other payables**

Trade and other payables represent liabilities for goods and services and are recognized at amortized cost,
using the effective interest rate method. The amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days from
initial recognition.

**15 DEFINED BENEFIT OBLIGATION**

Group has defined benefit plans in several countries, of which the most significant are the United States
43.6% of Group’s total defined benefit obligation, United Kingdom 25.5%, France 11.8%, Sweden 7.0% and
Germany 5.3%. The plans are in accordance with local laws and practices and are funded to satisfy the local
statutory funding requirements.

Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s most significant funded defined benefit plans are in the United States and the United
Kingdom. The assets are managed by external fund managers. The funds are allocated between equities and fixed

income instruments in order to provide return at target level and limited risk profile. The valuations of the
obligations are carried out by independent qualified actuaries.

In the United States, a part of Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s employees are members Group Retirement Plan for U.S.
Employees, which is a funded defined benefit plan and the largest of the Group’s schemes in the United States.
The plan is managed by Ahlstrom-Munksjo USA Inc.’s Pension Committee. The scheme has been closed to new
members since 2006. In addition to the Group Retirement Plan for U.S. Employees, Ahlstrom-Munksjö also
operates a number of other post-employment benefit plans in the United States, including providing postemployment medical and life insurance benefits, retirement plans for hourly paid employees, and State Earnings
Related Pension Schemes (SERPS). These plans are predominantly unfunded.

In the United Kingdom, the Group operates a funded defined benefit plan. The pension plan is designed
according to the Definitive Trust Deed and Rules and complies with the guidelines of the UK Pension Regulator.
The pension scheme has been closed to new members since 2006 and is managed through Ahlstrom-Munksjö
Chirnside Ltd.

In France the main funded defined benefit plan operated by the Group is the termination indemnity plan.
Termination indemnity plans are designed to finance the severances paid to the employees who leave the
company for retirement. Ahlstrom-Munksjö still operates other post-employment benefit plans in France which
are closed to new members for many years.

The Group’s main unfunded defined benefit plans are in Germany, Italy (TFR Trattamento di Fine
Rapporto, termination indemnity plan) and in Sweden. The pension schemes in Germany and Italy are closed for
new entrants. In Sweden, the pension cover is organized through unfunded defined benefit plans (ITP system,
Industrins och handels tilläggspension).

**Risks associated with defined benefit plans**

Through its defined benefit pension plans the Group is exposed to a number of risks.

**Changes in bond yields**

The employer’s defined benefit obligations pension liability are calculated using a discount rate which is
determined with reference to corporate bond yield as at the balance sheet date. A decrease (increase) in used
discount rates increase (decrease) the defined benefits obligations. However, a decrease (increase) in the used
discount rate yield also increases (decreases) the fair value of the assets partially offsetting the total impact of the
change in yield on the net defined benefit pension liability.

**Inflation risk**

The benefit of the plans is tied to the future pension increase, which depends on inflation and common
salary index. Higher inflation increases the benefit increase, which leads to an increase in liabilities and annual
payments to the insurance company.

If the active employee’s salary increases more than the common salary index, the amount of promised
benefit and the benefit obligation increases together with annual payments to life insurance company.

**Life expectancy**

Longevity risk arises in case the actual timing of mortality differs from the assumed. Possible adjustments in
mortality assumption have an effect on the employer’s liability.

**Accounting policies**

**Defined benefit obligation**

The Group has various pension schemes and other post-employment benefits in accordance with local
practices in different countries. The post-employment plans are classified as either defined contribution plans or
defined benefit plans. The schemes are mostly funded through payments to insurance companies or trusteeadministered funds according to local regulations. A defined contribution plan is a post-employment plan under
which the company and usually also the employees pay fixed contributions to an insurance company. The Group
has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to
pay the benefits to the employees. Contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognized as expense
in the period when they incur. All pension plans which do not meet the criteria for defined contribution plans are
defined benefit plans. Defined benefit plans typically define a fixed amount of benefit that an employee will
receive after retirement and which the company is responsible for.

The Group’s net obligation of defined benefit plans is calculated and recorded separately for each pension or
other post employment plan based on calculations prepared by independent actuaries. The present value of
defined benefit obligations is determined using the projected unit credit method. The net liability recognized in
the balance sheet is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the
fair value of the plan assets. The discount rate used to determine the present value of the defined benefit
obligation is equal to the yield on high quality corporate bonds or, if not available, government bonds.

The interest rates of the high quality corporate bonds are determined in the currency in which the benefits
will be paid with a similar maturity to the obligation.

The Group’s net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits, other than post employment benefits, is
the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior
periods.

**Accounting estimates and judgements**

Pension calculations under defined benefit plans include several factors that rely on management estimates:
the discount rate used in calculating pension expenses and obligations for the period, the rate of salary increase
and the rate of future discretionary bonuses decided by the insurance company. Changes in these assumptions can
significantly impact the amounts of pension liability and future pension expenses.

**Accounting policies**

A provision is recognized when a present legal or constructive obligation exists as a result of a past event
and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be
reliably estimated. Provisions are split between amounts expected to be settled within 12 months on the balance
sheet (current) and amounts expected to be settled later (non-current).

**Restructuring**

A provision for restructuring is only recognized when a formal plan has been approved and the
implementation of the plan has either commenced or the plan has been announced.

**Environmental**

Environmental provisions are recorded based on current interpretations of environmental laws and
regulations. Such provisions are recognized when it is probable that an obligation has arisen and that the amount
of the obligation can be reliably measured. The amount recognized is the present value of the estimated future
expenditure determined in accordance with local conditions and requirements.

**16 PROVISIONS (Continued)**

**Accounting estimates and judgements**

**Environmental**

The estimates used in determining the provisions for environmental costs are based on management’s
expectations of, for example:

   - Timing and scope

   - Future cost levels

   - Laws and regulations enacted at time of the restoration works

The timing of the environmental costs depends on the expected useful lives of the Group’s sites. These
range from 50 – 70 years. In measuring the future cost levels, the Group estimates future costs and adjusts these
for the effect of inflation, cost-base development and discounting. The estimated costs are based on current laws
and regulations in place at the time of making the provision.

The Group utilizes a third party consultant to estimate both the closure and long-term care costs for the
landfills. The estimate is based on the area finally to be capped and the capping materials and activities required
along with the permit and regulatory requirements for closure and post-closure maintenance. These costs are
reviewed periodically by the Group’s environmental experts and by a third party consultant.

Because actual outflows can differ from estimates due to changes in law, regulations, public expectations,
technology, prices and conditions, and can take place many years in the future, the carrying amounts of
provisions are regularly reviewed and adjusted to take into account any such changes. The discount rate used is
reviewed annually.

**Net debt and capital management**

This section outlines the Group’s net debt and how Ahlstrom-Munksjö manages its capital including
liquidity management. The Group’s objective when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to
continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other
stakeholders, and maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

In order to maintain or adjust the Group’s capital structure, the Group uses different means such as adjust
the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, issue new shares, refinance its debt or sell assets to reduce debt.
Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s monitors capital based on the gearing ratio with a target below 100%. At the end of 2020
the ratio was 62.1 % (71.8 %).

**17 NET DEBT**

Net debt is Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s key measure to evaluate the total external debt financing of the Group. Net
debt is defined as borrowings less cash and cash equivalents and a securitization liability. The Group assumed the
securitization liability in 2018 as a result of the acquisition of Expera and the arrangement has been extinguished
since that date. The Group’s sources of borrowing for funding and liquidity purposes are primarily bank loans,
pension loan and bonds. The Group has also entered into a number of lease liabilities to secure the availability of
assets used in the production process.

**Borrowings**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s bank loans include several facilities. These facilities consist mainly of, in original
nominal amounts, a term facility of EUR 200 million maturing in 2021; a multi currency revolving credit facility
of EUR 200 million and term facilities in EUR, SEK and USD totalling to approximately EUR 208 million
maturing in 2022; term facilities in EUR and USD totalling to approximately EUR 320 million maturing in 2023;
and a working capital credit facility of BRL 330 million maturing in 2023.

On April 22, 2020 Ahlstrom-Munksjö signed a new EUR 50 million committed revolving credit facility for
12 months as part of the Company’s overall funding liquidity management activities. In addition, on April 20,
2020 the company signed a pension loan (TyEL pension loan) of EUR 20 million maturing in 2023 and on
May 11, 2020 a new term loan of EUR 50 million maturing in 2021.

On December 13, 2019 Ahlstrom-Munksjö issued a EUR 100 million hybrid bond. The proceeds from the
hybrid bond issue were used to partly repay and refinance the EUR 200 million term facility maturing on 2021.
More information about the hybrid bond can be found in note 18.

At the balance sheet date, the weighted average interest rate, excluding lease liabilities and hybrid bond, for
the Group was approximately 2.7 % (3.4%). Net debt amounted to EUR 735.8 million (EUR 885.0 million) at
December 31, 2020, resulting in a gearing of 62.1 % (71.8%). Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s financing facilities contain
two gearing financial covenants that are monitored quarterly which are consolidated net debt to consolidated
EBITDA and consolidated net debt to equity. During the second quarter of 2020, Ahlstrom-Munksjö proactively
increased its financial flexibility by renegotiating its financial covenant, the consolidated net debt to consolidated
EBITDA. IFRS16 impact is excluded from the debt covenant calculations. Throughout the reporting period the
Group was in full compliance with the covenants of its financing agreements and management expects such
compliance to continue.

**Interest rate risk**

Interest rate risk refers to the risk that changes in interest rates would have a negative effect on the result of
the Group and could affect the long-term competitiveness of Ahlstrom-Munksjö. There is a risk of interest rates
moving both upwards and downwards. However, in accordance with the loan terms, the reference rates in the
Group’s bank loans have a interest rate floor at zero. Accordingly, if the reference rates are below zero, the
Group’s interest payments correspond to the margin.

Most of the Group’s bank loans are at variable interest rates, which for loans denominated in euros is in
essence fixed when the reference interest rate is below zero, due to the interest rate floor in the bank loans. The
bond is a fixed rate borrowing. The average maturity of the total debt portfolio, excluding hybrid bond, is
currently 11 months (8 months) with interest rate derivatives.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**17 NET DEBT (Continued)**

Consideration is taken at all times to assess how vulnerable the Group is to a change in interest rates. In
order to limit the impact of movements in interest rates, the Treasury Policy provides the following guidelines:

   - Aim is to achieve an average maturity of the interest rates in the debt portfolio, including the interest
rate derivatives, of 2 years +/-1 year or in accordance with the loan agreement if so specified.

   - Interest maturities are preferably spread out evenly over time in order to avoid substantial risk
concentrated on single financial year.

In accordance with its policy, Ahlstrom-Munksjö may hedge its interest rate risk by using derivative
instruments, such as interest rate swaps. The gross nominal volume of interest rate derivatives at the time of
financial statements is EUR 50.0 million and USD 130.0 million, by which floating-rate financing has been
converted into fixed-rate financing. All derivatives are maturing in 2023. The group applies IFRS hedge
accounting on all interest rate swap contracts. At December 31, 2020, the fair value of the interest rate swaps
under hedge accounting was EUR -0.4 million. The Group booked gain of EUR 0.0 million to the cash flow
hedge transferred to this year’s result in OCI.

More information on how Ahlstrom-Munksjö manages its financial risks is presented below in note 19.

**Sensitivity analysis of Ahlstrom-Munksjö position to changes in interest rates**

**Cash and cash equivalents**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö utilizes cash pools to optimize the amount of interest to be paid and received on the
amounts held in the bank accounts in order to improve liquidity management. Group Treasury is responsible for
the Group’s cash pool management.

Bank deposits earn variable interest based on the bank’s daily deposit rate.

The cash and cash equivalents disclosed above include restricted cash amounting to EUR 47.3 million
(EUR 45.7 million).

**Accounting policies**

**Borrowings**

Bonds, bank loans and loans from multilateral institutions are recognized at their inception at their fair value
(typically the proceeds received) net of directly related transaction costs incurred. The borrowings are
subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Transaction costs are amortized
over the life of the borrowings based on the effective interest method.

**Facility fees**

Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognized as transaction costs of the credit facilities
and facility loans to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case,

F-57


-----

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**17 NET DEBT (Continued)**

the fee is deferred until the draw down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or
all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalized as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortized
over the period of the facility to which it relates.

**De-recognition of borrowings**

Borrowings are removed from the balance sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged,
cancelled or expired. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability that has been
extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred
or liabilities assumed, is recognised in profit or loss within financial items.

**Lease liabilities**

For the accounting policy please see note 12.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, deposits held at call with financial institutions, other
short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible
to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Bank overdrafts, as
applicable, are shown within borrowings in current liabilities in the balance sheet. Restricted cash includes cash
balances that are subject to regulatory restrictions or other limitations, and are therefore not immediately
available to the other entities of the Group.

**18 EQUITY**

The Board of the Directors of Ahlstrom-Munksjö together with the management of the Group considers
appropriate financial targets for Ahlstrom-Munksjö and agrees on a financial target framework. According to the
long-term financial targets approved by the Board of Directors, Ahlstrom-Munksjö aims for a stable and annually
increasing dividend to be paid to shareholders several times a year.

In 2020, the Company decided to distribute dividends to its shareholders totalling to EUR 59.8 million
(EUR 59.9 million). Dividends were paid in four different instalments, three during the year 2020 (April, July
and October) and the last instalment in January 2021. The Board of Directors’ dividend proposal to the Annual
General Meeting based on the financial statements of the year 2020, will be decided after the Extraordinary
General Meeting to be held on February 19, 2021.

**Hybrid bond**

On December 13, 2019 Ahlstrom-Munksjö issued a EUR 100 million hybrid bond. The hybrid bond does
not have a specified maturity date, but Ahlstrom-Munksjö may redeem it for the first time on February 13, 2024,
or on any interest payment date thereafter of if there is a change of control in Ahlstrom-Munksjö. It bears interest
at a fixed rate of 3.879 percent per annum until February 13, 2024. The hybrid bond will be subordinated to
Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s debt obligations and is treated as equity in Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s consolidated financial
statements prepared in accordance with IFRS. The hybrid bond does not confer their holder the rights of a
shareholder and does not dilute the holdings of the current shareholders.

The hybrid bond includes a disposal event call option, entitling Ahlstrom-Munksjö to redeem the hybrid
bond in a disposal event where the related aggregate disposal proceeds are equal or greater than the outstanding
aggregate amount of the hybrid bond. In such event, Ahlstrom-Munksjö is entitled to redeem the hybrid bond in
whole, but not in part, on the first anniversary following the hybrid bond issue date and at any time thereafter at
103 percent of their nominal amount together with accrued interest to the date of redemption.

Upon a change of control event, Ahlstrom-Munksjö is entitled to redeem the hybrid bond in whole, but not
in part, within six months from the change of control at the nominal amount together with accrued interest to the
date of redemption. Unless Ahlstrom-Munksjö at its option redeems the hybrid bond within six months from the
date of change of control, the interest rate of the hybrid bond will increase by an additional margin of 5.0% p.a.

The hedging reserve comprises the unrealized fair value changes of cash flow hedges, net of taxes,
qualifying for hedge accounting and the amount recognized is reclassified in income statement when the hedged
item affects the profit or loss. See note 19 for more information on cash flow hedges.

**Hybrid bond**

The hybrid bond is is treated as equity in the consolidated financial statements. Interest on the hybrid bond
is not accrued but is recorded in retained earnings in the consolidated financial statements, net of taxes, after
dividend approved by the Annual General Meeting. The arrangement fees are also recorded in retained earnings.

**Retained earnings**

The following are recorded directly to retained earnings:

   - The Group has certain long-term incentive plans for key personnel. These plans are accounted for as
share-based payments where the fair value of the awards granted in shares are classified as equitysettled and recorded in the income statement and retained earnings in equity over the vesting period.
See note 7 for more information on share-based payments.

   - The Group has hybrid bond. Interest on hybrid bond is charged to retained earnings as well as the
related arrangement fees.

   - The Group has defined benefit plans. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments
and changes in actuarial assumptions for these defined benefit plans are charged or credited to retained
earnings. See note 15 for more information on defined benefit obligations.

**19 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT**

**General**

Financial risks of the Group consist of credit risk (see note 14), funding risk, liquidity risk and market risks.
Market risks are further divided to currency risk, interest rate risk (refer to note 17) and commodity risk.

The Treasury Policy sets the Board of Directors’ guidelines on how finance and treasury operations are
carried out and how financial risks within the Group are managed. The guidelines aim to ensure that the Group’s
financial risks are kept at an acceptable level.

The Treasury Policy is approved by the Board of Directors of Ahlstrom-Munksjö. The Board of Directors
has the overall responsibility for managing financial risks. Executive Treasury Committee monitors and manages
the financial risks. Operational management of financial risks is carried out centrally by the Group Treasury
under the Treasury Policy. Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation
with the Group’s operating units.

Group Treasury is handling all hedging of foreign exchange, commodity and interest rates, if nothing else
has been approved. Where all relevant criteria are met, hedge accounting is applied to remove the accounting
mismatch between the hedging instrument and the hedged item.

**Currency risk**

Due to the global operations of Ahlstrom-Munksjö, the Group is exposed to currency risk. Currency risk
refers to the risk that fluctuations in the foreign exchange market will negatively affect the Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s
cash flow, net result and equity. Currency exposure, defined as all unhedged exposure in foreign currency, is split
into two types of exposure: transaction exposure and translation exposure.

**Transaction exposure**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö conducts manufacturing and sells its products around the globe and is therefore exposed
to transaction risk. Transaction exposure arises from commercial and finance-related transactions and payments
in a currency other than an operation’s functional currency i.e. from internal purchases, sales between
manufacturing units and market companies, external sales and purchases as well as from financing transactions in
foreign currencies. Additionally, firm commitments to acquire businesses may expose the Group to foreign
currency transaction risk.

Foreign currency cash flows are hedged on a net exposure basis in accordance with the rules set out in the
Treasury Policy. The Group’s risk management strategy in terms of currency risk is to hedge 75% (+/-10%) of
the forecasted cash flows for a period up to 9 months if the total exposure to forecasted net flows of foreign
currency exceeds the equivalent of 2% of the total turnover of the company. The Group uses forward contracts to
hedge this commercial foreign currency exposure and applies cash flow hedge accounting. The forward
contracts’ maturity is materially reconciled with the timing of the forecasted sales and purchases. At
December 31, 2020, the fair value of the foreign currency forwards under hedge accounting was
EUR 4.2 million. In 2020, the Group booked loss of EUR 2.1 million to the cash flow hedge transferred to this
year’s result in OCI. The Group has not historically booked material ineffectiveness from the hedging
relationships, however, ineffectiveness might arise from timing differences.

In addition to using derivatives for hedging, Ahlstrom-Munksjö also employs practical actions in order to
reduce the currency risk. The number of currencies used in intercompany invoicing is minimized and where
possible, Group Treasury will match foreign exchange cash flows within the Group.

The following tables show the Group’s exposure to currency cash flow risk.

At the end of the reporting period, the hedge ratio for the forecasted cash flows for the next 9 months,
including indirect exposure embedded in pulp prices and other adjustments, was approximately 72% (74%) for
USD, about 82% for SEK (67%), and about 71% for GBP (-%). Hedging of GBP was initiated during 2020. The
exposures in other currencies are limited and are not hedged. Outstanding nominal amounts at the end of the year
for these forward contracts were USD 35 million, SEK 720 million, and GBP 16 million.

The following table shows the Group’s estimated sensitivity for the next 9 months to a currency rate of a
weaker EUR of 5%, including FX-hedges and indirect exposures. The table is based on information monitored by
the Board for currency risk management.

Currency change of 5% to EUR . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -1.5 -1.0 0.4 0.8 0.1 -0.3 -0.5

The parent company has provided financing (or received deposits) to (from) its foreign subsidiaries which
have been hedged by using forward contracts at December 31, 2020. The nominal amounts of the loans are
USD 5 million, CNY 25 million, the nominal amount of the deposit is JPY 661 million. Additionally, the parent
company hedges an external loan with a nominal amount of USD 35 million. Hedge accounting is not applied to
these relationships. Furthermore, these amounts correspond to the nominal amounts of the forward contracts,
which have a maturity of three months and are adjusted according to the open balances. These forward contracts
are recognised at fair value with changes in fair value through the exchange gains and losses within the financial
items. The fair value for the forwards was EUR -0.0 million at December 31, 2020.

**Translation risk**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s income statement and balance sheet are both exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations,
as these affect the translation of subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.

The Group aims to minimize currency risk related to translation exposure by aiming to balance assets and
liabilities of subsidiaries so that the foreign exchange risk is minimized in the consolidated balance sheet. Due to
the long-term nature of net investments, equity hedging is not normally performed by the Group.

The following table shows the Group’s translation exposure arising from net investments in foreign
subsidiaries in the predominant currencies for the Group.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**19 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (Continued)**

**Accounting policies**

**Derivative instruments and hedging activities**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö uses derivative instruments to manage certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign
currency rates and interest rates. These derivative financial instruments are recognized initially at fair value on
the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are
carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.

Hedge accounting is applicable when, at inception of the hedge, there is a formal designation and
documentation of the hedging relationship and other criteria for hedge accounting are met. At inception of the
hedge relationship, the Group documents the economic relationship between hedging instruments and hedged
items including whether changes in the cash flows of the hedging instruments are expected to offset changes in
the cash flows of hedged items. The Group documents its risk management strategy and objective for
undertaking its hedge transactions.

The Group only applies cash flow hedge accounting, which is used to hedge exposure to variability in cash
flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a highly probable forecasted transaction or firm
commitment. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument is booked in other
comprehensive income and accumulated in equity. It is reclassified in income statement when the hedged item
affects the income statement, or in the initial cost of the hedged item when it relates to the hedge of a firm
commitment to acquire a non-financial item (for example, business combination). The Group does not separate
forward points in a hedge relationship.

When a hedging instrument expires, is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for
hedge accounting, any cumulative deferred gain or loss and deferred costs of hedging in equity at that time
remains in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs, resulting in the recognition of a non-financial asset such
as inventory. When the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss and
deferred costs of hedging that were reported in equity are immediately reclassified to income statement.
Subsequent changes in the value of the hedging instrument after the hedging relationship is terminated are
recorded in income statement.

**Commodity risk**

Commodity risk refers to the risk that changes in the cost of raw materials (pulp, titanium dioxide etc.) and
energy (electricity, gas, oil etc.) have a negative effect on the result and/or competitiveness of AhlstromMunksjö. Consideration as to the vulnerability of the Group to changes in relevant commodity prices is taken
periodically.

To mitigate the commodity risk exposure, the Group hedges commodity exposures in line with the Group
Treasury Policy. In accordance with the policy, commodity hedging should have a maximum length of 3 years
and can be up to 50% of forecasted consumption in the first year, 40% of forecasted consumption in the second
year and 30% in the third year. All hedging transaction are also to be connected to projects, customer agreements
or other direct identifiable business risks. This is in order to avoid speculative hedging. At the balance sheet date,
the Group did not have any outstanding commodity derivatives.

**Funding and liquidity risk**

**Funding risk**

Funding risk refers to the risk the Ahlstrom-Munksjö does not at all times have access to financing or
financing at an acceptable cost. This may arise should the Group become too dependent on a single source of
financing, or if the maturity structure of the Group’s debt portfolio is too concentrated. In order to mitigate
funding risk, the Group aims to spread its debt across different lenders, different maturities and different forms of
financing.

Ahlstrom-Munksjö has outlined the following guidelines in its Treasury Policy, which aim to mitigate the
funding risk. The Group aims to ensure that not more than 50% of its debt portfolio will mature in the same
12-month period and the average maturity of the long-term finance should be at least 2 years. The Group also
aims to avoid the inclusion of covenants in all types of financing agreements.

**19 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (Continued)**

**Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk is the risk that Ahlstrom-Munksjö will not have sufficient funds to pay foreseen committed
obligations in addition to unforeseen expenditures. In order to mitigate this risk, Group Treasury monitors the
Group’s cash pools, bank agreements and liquidity to ensure at all times that there is sufficient liquidity. The
liquidity situation is monitored in such way that Ahlstrom-Munksjö Group at all times has sufficient liquidity.
The Group’s cash accounts are included in the cash pools.

Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s cash needs in respect of meeting its financial liabilities are show in the tables below.
The maturity analysis was determined at the balance sheet date based on the contractual obligations existing at
the balance sheet date. The maturity analysis is based on undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest payments
that are shown separately at the bottom of the table. The interest payments are based on market conditions at the
balance sheet date. Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s liquidity position at year-end comprising of the strong cash position of
EUR 308.7 million and increase in the committed credit lines to EUR 261.0 million is sufficient to meet the 2021
repayment obligations on the existing debt maturities if the expected closing for Tender Offer and its impacts to
the Company’s capital structure would not take place as estimated.

Ahlstrom-Munksjö uses factoring or similar arrangements for working capital management. All factoring or
similar arrangements are made on non-recourse basis. At the end of the reporting period the outstanding amount
under the factoring or other similar arrangements was EUR 188.5 million (EUR 224.3 million). For more
information please see note 14.

**Financial instruments subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting agreements and similar agreements**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö have a number of counterparties in respect of which the Group is both buyer and seller.
Consequently, Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s gross financial assets can be significant before offsetting. Offsetting is
typically limited within specific products and is possible when payment and receipt from the same counterparty
occur simultaneously. These financial assets and liabilities are not offset on the balance sheet as the offsetting in
the balance sheet is allowed only in certain, limited circumstances.

The table below shows the Group’s derivative contracts that are subject to offsetting agreements. The
column net amount shows the impact on the Group’s balance sheet if all set-off rights were exercised. Under the
terms of these arrangements, only where certain credit events occur (such as default), the net position owing/
receivable to a single counterparty in the same currency will be taken as owing and all the relevant arrangements
terminated. As the Group does not presently have a legally enforceable right of set-off, these amounts have not
been offset in the balance sheet.

The Group considers that the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and
trade and other payables provide a reasonable approximation of fair value, due to the short maturity and liquid
nature of these elements. In addition, the carrying amounts of non-current and current loan from financial
institutions and other loan are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate. The fair value amounts
are reasonable approximations of their carrying amounts.

**Accounting policies**

**Financial assets at amortised cost**

The group classifies its financial assets as at amortised cost only if both of the following criteria are met:

   - the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash flows;

   - the contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest.

The financial assets in this group are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method if the time
value of money is significant. Gains and losses are recognized in income when the loans and receivables are
derecognized or impaired (see note 14), as well as through the amortization process. This category of financial
assets includes trade and other receivables and cash equivalents (see note 17).

**Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through income statement**

The Group classifies derivatives for which hedge accounting is not applied as financial assets at fair value
through profit or loss (FVPL).

Financial assets at fair value through income statement are carried on the balance sheet at fair value with
gains or losses recognized in the income statement. Derivatives, other than those designated as effective hedging
instruments, are classified as held for trading and are included in this category.

Other investments include unlisted shares and interests carried at fair value. Fair value changes are
recognised in the other comprehensive income. For unlisted shares and interests the fair value cannot be
measured reliably and therefore the management considers that the cost is a reasonable approximation of the fair
value.

**Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost**

Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost are initially recognized at fair value, net of transaction costs.
For interest-bearing loans and borrowings this is the fair value of the proceeds received net of issue costs
associated with the borrowing.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**19 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (Continued)**

After initial recognition, other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the
effective interest method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or
premium on settlement. Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or cancellation of liabilities are
recognized in interest and other income and finance costs respectively.

This category of financial liabilities includes trade and other payables and debt (see note 17).

**Fair values of financial assets and liabilities**

The financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the balance sheet have been classified based on
the three hierarchy levels:

   - level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can
access at the measurement date;

   - level 2: inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly;

   - level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

The Group considers that the carrying amount of cash, trade receivables and various deposits provide a
reasonable approximation of fair value, due to the short maturity and liquid nature of these elements.

For financial liabilities at amortized cost, the fair value of financial liabilities is determined using:

   - the quoted price for listed instruments (a detailed analysis is performed in the case of a material
decrease in liquidity to evidence whether the observed price corresponds to the fair value; otherwise the
quoted price is adjusted);

   - the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted using rates observed by the Group at the
end of the period for lease liabilities and other instruments.

Fair values of derivatives are based on valuations provided by external parties using various valuation
techniques. The fair value of the forward exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange rates at the
balance sheet date with the resulting fair value discounted to present value. The fair value of interest rate swaps is
determined using net present value method, supported by market interest rates and other market information at
the end of the reporting period.

**20 OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS (Continued)**

Other guarantees and commitments include binding contracts for purchases of energy and IT development
projects among others.

At the end of December, 2020, the Group does not have any contingent liabilities.

**Accounting policies**

**Commitments**
Unrecognized commitments are disclosed where the Group has an agreement or a pledge to assume a
financial obligation at a future date.

**Contingent liabilities**
Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed by uncertain future events
that are not wholly within the control of the entity. They can also include obligations that are not recognized
because their amount cannot be measured reliably or because settlement is not probable. A contingent liability is
not recognized in the statement of financial position but as off-balance sheet commitments.

**Accounting policies**

**Subsidiaries, joint operations and associates**

Subsidiaries are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by Ahlstrom-Munksjö controls, ie. when the
Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement and has the ability to affect those
returns through exercising power. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date control is achieved to the date
when the Group ceases to exercise power.

Associated companies are those in which the Group has a significant influence over operational and
financial policies. Significant influence is the power to participate in, but not control or jointly control, the
financial and operating decisions of the investee. These investments are accounted for using the equity method.

The Group recognises its direct right to the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operations and
its share of any jointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in accordance with the
Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s contractual rights and obligations.

**Transactions eliminated on consolidation and transactions between the owners of the parent**

Transactions between Group companies, including intra-group receivables and liabilities, income or
expenses and unrealized gains or losses are eliminated in full. Unrealized gains arising from transactions with
associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest, unless otherwise contractually
agreed by the parties. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains, but only to the extent
that there is no evidence of impairment. Transactions with the owners of the parent are reported within
shareholders’ equity. Transactions with non-controlling interests are reported as transactions with equity owners
of the Group. Divestments to and purchases from non-controlling interests result in gains and losses for the
Group, which are reported in equity.

**22 AUDITOR REMUNERATION**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) makes resolutions each year to elect the Group’s
auditors. It was resolved at the 2020 AGM that in accordance with the proposal of the Board that KPMG Oy Ab
would be appointed as the Group’s auditor.

**23 NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS**

**Interest Rate Benchmark Reform—Phase 2—Amendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, IAS 39**
**Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, IFRS 4**
**Insurance Contracts and IFRS 16 Leases**

To be applied from 1 January 2021

Amendments address issues affecting financial statements when changes are made to contractual cash flows
and hedging relationships as a result of interest rate benchmark reform. Amendments assist companies in
providing useful information about the effects of interest rate benchmark reform on financial statements.

**Amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment**

To be applied from 1 January 2022

Under the amendments, proceeds from selling items before the related item of PPE is available for use
should be recognized in profit or loss, together with the costs of producing those items.

**Amendments to IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets**

To be applied from 1 January 2022

When an onerous contract is accounted for based on the costs of fulfilling the contract, the amendments
clarify that these costs comprise both the incremental costs and an allocation of other direct costs.

**Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018–2020**

To be applied from 1 January 2022

The annual improvements process provides a mechanism for minor and non-urgent amendments to IFRSs to
be grouped together and issued in one package annually. The amendments clarify the following standards:

   - IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards—Subsidiary as a first-time
adopter: This amendment simplifies the application of IFRS 1 for a subsidiary that becomes a first-time
adopter later than its parent—a subsidiary may elect to measure cumulative translation differences at
amounts included in the consolidated financial statements of the parent.

   - IFRS 9 Financial Instruments—Fees in the ‘10 per cent’ test for derecognition of financial liabilities:
This amendment clarifies that—for the purpose of performing the ‘’10 per cent test’ for derecognition
of financial liabilities—in determining those fees paid net of fees received, a borrower includes only
fees paid or received between the borrower and the lender, including fees paid or received by either the
borrower or lender on the other’s behalf.

   - IFRS 16 Leases—Lease incentives—Example 13. The amendment removes the illustration of
payments from the lessor relating to leasehold improvements. The example was not clear as to why
such payments are not a lease incentive.

   - IAS 41 Agriculture—Taxation in fair value measurements. This amendment removes the requirement
to exclude cash flows for taxation when measuring fair value, thereby aligning the fair value
measurement requirements in IAS 41 with those in IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement. When a present
value technique is used to measure fair value, the assumptions used for the cash flows and discount
rates should be internally consistent – i.e. using either after tax or pre-tax for both.

**Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements**

To be applied from 1 January 2023

The amendments are to promote consistency in application and clarify the requirements on determining if a
liability is current or non-current.

**IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts**

To be applied from 1 January 2023

F-72

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**23 NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (Continued)**

The new standard for insurance contracts will help investors and others better understand insurers’ risk
exposure, profitability and financial position. This standard replaces IFRS 4 standard.

The Group doesn’t expect any material impact on the financial statements regarding the new standards,
amendment nor improvements.

**24 POST-BALANCE SHEET EVENTS**

On September 24, 2020, a consortium, consisting of Ahlström Capital, funds managed or advised by Bain
Capital as well as Viknum and Belgrano Inversiones made a public recommended cash tender offer for all shares
in Ahlstrom-Munksjö. The offer period for the tender offer commenced on October 22, 2020 and expired on
January 14, 2021. The consortium’s intention is to eventually acquire all the shares in Ahlstrom-Munksjö and
apply for a delisting of the shares from Nasdaq Helsinki and Nasdaq Stockholm to develop the company in a
private domain.

On January 18, 2021 based on the preliminary result, the offeror decided that it will waive the minimum
acceptance condition and complete the tender offer in accordance with its terms and conditions provided that the
final result of the tender offer confirms that the tender offer has been validly accepted with respect to shares
representing, together with any shares otherwise held by the offeror prior to the date of the announcement of the
final result of the tender offer, on a fully diluted basis at least 75% of the shares and voting rights of the
company. On January 20, 2021 the consortium declared the tender offer unconditional with approximately 81%
of shares validly tendered and accepted in the tender offer.

On January 20, 2021, the offeror also announced the commencement of a subsequent offer period in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the tender offer. The subsequent offer period commenced on
January 21, 2021 and expired on February 4, 2021. According to the final result of the subsequent offer period,
the shares validly tendered and accepted during the subsequent offer period, together with the shares validly
tendered and accepted during the initial offer period (as extended) and otherwise acquired by the offeror through
market purchases until February 8, 2021, represent approximately 90.6% of all the shares and voting rights
carried by the shares in Ahlstrom-Munksjö. The offeror’s intention is to apply for the shares in AhlstromMunksjö to be delisted from Nasdaq Helsinki Ltd (“Nasdaq Helsinki”) and from Nasdaq Stockholm AB
(“Nasdaq Stockholm”), respectively, as soon as permitted and reasonably practicable under the applicable laws
and regulations and the rules of Nasdaq Helsinki and Nasdaq Stockholm. As the offeror’s holdings in AhlstromMunksjö will exceed 90% of all the shares and voting rights carried by the shares in Ahlstrom-Munksjö after the
settlement of the shares tendered in the tender offer, the offeror will initiate compulsory redemption proceedings
to acquire the remaining shares in accordance with the Finnish Companies Act.

**Extraordinary General Meeting**

On January 25, 2021, notice was given to the shareholders of Ahlstrom-Munksjö to Extraordinary General
Meeting to be held on February 19, 2021 to resolve on the election of new Board of Directors and certain other
matters.

**Change in Ahlstrom-Munksjö Group ownership**

Following the completion of the Tender Offer on February 4, 2021, Spa (BC) Lux Holdco S.à r.l. (entity
owned and controlled by funds managed and/or advised by Bain Capital Private Equity (Europe), LLP, and/or its
affiliates), Ahlstrom Invest B.V., Viknum AB (an entity in which Alexander Ehrnrooth, a member of the Board
of Directors, exercises influence) and Belgrano Inversiones Oy (an entity in which Alexander Ehrnrooth, a

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**23 NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (Continued)**

**Transaction costs**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö will pay approximately EUR 9 million of transaction costs resulting from the successful
closing of the Tender Offer, which will be recognized as expenses during first quarter of 2021. These expenses
will be reported as items affecting comparability in the Company’s results for the first quarter 2021.

**Long-term incentive plans**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s Board of Directors decided on February 9, 2021 following the closing of the Tender
Offer to prematurely terminate all existing long-term share-based incentive plans and to settle them in cash.
Matching share plans (2019-2021, 2020-2022) reward payments are made to the participants immediately and
long-term share-based incentive plans (LTI 2019-2021, LTI 2020-2022) rewards payments are made to the
participants in three months from closing of the Tender Offer. The estimated amount of cash payments (including
social security costs) is approximately EUR 18.6 million during the first half of the year of 2021. The income
statement impact over the first quarter of 2021 resulting from accelerated vesting is approximately
EUR 15.8 million. The income statement impact will be reported as items affecting comparability in the Group’s
results.

**Change of control events impact on Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s long-term funding**

As a result of the settlement of the tender offer on February 4, 2021, the EUR 249.5 million senior bond and
EUR 599.9 million of the bank loans (amounts reported as carrying values as of December 31, 2020) will
become redeemable during the first half of 2021 to the extent the financing providers exercise their mandatory
prepayment rights based on the customary change of control terms in the existing financing documents.

In addition, unless Ahlstrom-Munksjö at its option decides to redeem the hybrid bond within six months
from the date of completion of the tender offer, the interest rate of the hybrid bond will increase by an additional
margin of 5.0% p.a.

For purposes of the refinancing of Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s existing debt, financing the Tender Offer and other
agreed purposes, SPA Holdings 3 Oy and SPA US Holdco, Inc have committed senior term facilities and senior
bridge facilities totaling to EUR 1,650 million (nominal) provided on a customary certain funds basis, with
maturities of 7 years. Any repayments required by the existing Ahlstrom-Munksjö financing providers are
expected to be initially funded using proceeds from an intercompany loan provided to Ahlstrom-Munksjö by
SPA Holdings 3 Oy and Ahlstrom-Munksjo USA Inc by SPA US Holdco, Inc and cash on balance sheet in each
case, in all material respects reflecting the terms of the committed facilities of SPA Holdings 3 Oy and SPA US
Holdco, Inc described above with the exception of a 12 month maturity, customary margin step-up and other
customary changes for such intercompany loan instrument.

In addition, the existing committed EUR 200 million multicurrency revolving facility agreement and the
committed EUR 50 million revolving credit facility, which both were undrawn at the balance sheet date, may be
cancelled at the lender’s option. SPA Holdings 3 Oy and SPA US Holdco, Inc also have a committed
EUR 325 million revolving credit facility under its senior facilities agreement to replace these facilities and to
provide ongoing working capital and general corporate funding requirements for the Group.

##### Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s business and basis of preparation

**1 INFORMATION ABOUT AHLSTROM-MUNKSJÖ**

**General**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö is a global leader in fiber-based materials, supplying innovative and sustainable
solutions to customers worldwide. Our offerings include filter materials, release liners, food and beverage
processing materials, decor papers, abrasive and tape backings, electro technical paper, glass fiber materials,
medical fiber materials and solutions for diagnostics as well as a range of specialty papers for industrial and
consumer end-uses.

Ahlstrom-Munksjö Oyj, a Finnish public limited liability company with a corporate identity
number, 2480661-5, is the parent company (“parent company”, “Ahlstrom-Munksjö Oyj”) of the
Ahlstrom-Munksjö Group (the “Group”, “Ahlstrom-Munksjö”). Ahlstrom-Munksjö is registered in Helsinki,
Finland. Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s registered address is Alvar Aallon katu 3 C, 00101 Helsinki, Finland. AhlstromMunksjö’s shares are listed on Nasdaq Helsinki and Nasdaq Stockholm.

**2 BASIS OF PREPARATION**

**Basis of preparation and accounting policies in our audited financial statements**

**Basis of preparation**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and
the interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee as approved by the Commission of the
European Communities (EU) for application in the European Union.

The following general principles have been applied to our financial statements:

   - The parent company’s functional and presentation currency is the euro (“EUR”) and financial
statements are presented in millions of euros (“EUR million”), unless otherwise indicated.

   - Financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments,
unlisted shares and interests and defined benefit pension plan assets, which are measured at fair value.

   - Non-current assets and non-current liabilities consist of amounts that are expected to be recovered or
paid more than 12 months after the reporting period. Current assets and current liabilities consist of
amounts that are expected to be recovered or paid within 12 months of the end of the reporting period.

   - All financial data in the financial statements have been rounded and consequently the sum of individual
figures can deviate from the total sum. Percentages are subject to possible rounding differences.

   - The accounting policies outlined in these financial statements have been applied consistently
throughout the Group and comparative information has been reclassified where required to ensure
consistency.

**_Foreign currency translation_**

Figures representing the financial result and position of each subsidiary in the Group are measured using the
currency of the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates (the functional currency).

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates
prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies are
translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.

Foreign exchange differences arising from the currency translation are recognized in the income statement.
Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from operating business transactions are included in operating profit,
and those arising from financial transactions are included as a net amount in financial income and expenses. The
foreign exchange gains and losses arising from the qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying hedges of a net
investment in foreign operations are recorded in the statement of other comprehensive income and accumulated
currency differences are recognized in equity.

F-83


-----

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2 BASIS OF PREPARATION (Continued)**

The balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries are translated into euros at the exchange rates prevailing at the
balance sheet date while the income statements are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
Translating the result of the period using different exchange rates on the balance sheet and income statement
causes a translation difference to be recognized in equity and its change is recorded in the statement of other
comprehensive income.

Translation differences arising from the elimination of the acquisition price of foreign subsidiaries and from
the translation differences in equity items since the acquisition date as well as the effective portion of hedging
instruments that hedge the currency exposures on net investments are recognized in the statement of other
comprehensive income. When a subsidiary is disposed or sold wholly or partially, translation differences arising
from the net investment and related hedges are recognized in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on
sale.

**_Classification of certain balance sheet items_**

Classification of certain balance sheet items between interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing assets and
liabilities were redefined. The change in presentation led into changes in calculation of some non-IFRS based key
figures. All comparative periods have been restated accordingly. The restatement as of December 31, 2018
between current borrowings and trade and other payables amounted to EUR 8.8 million.

**_Adopted IFRS standards, amendments and improvements_**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö has applied the following standards and amendments for the first time for their annual
reporting period commencing January 1, 2019:

   - IFRS 16 Leases

   - IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments

   - Amendments to IFRS 9 Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation

   - Amendments to IAS 28 Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures

   - Plan amendment, Curtailment or Settlement (Amendments to IAS 19)

   - Annual Improvements to IFRSs (2015-2017 cycle)

The group has changed its accounting policies following the adoption of IFRS 16 and IFRIC 23.

**_IFRS 16 Leases_**

The new standard, IFRS 16 Leases was effective on January 1, 2019. The new standard resulted in the
recognition of the majority of Ahlstrom-Munksjö‘s leases on the balance sheet and therefore AhlstromMunksjö‘s assets and liabilities have increased. Ahlstrom-Munksjö has adopted the new standard using a
simplified approach and thus comparative figures are not restated.

See notes 8, 9 and 12 for more information.

**_IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments_**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö has adopted IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments effective January 1,
2019. Group is operating in a complex multinational environment and has reviewed it’s income tax treatment and
adopted the interpretation using a modified retrospective approach. An adjustment of EUR -2.6 million related to
tax liabilities has been recognized to the opening balance of retained earnings and income tax payables at
January 1, 2019.

The consolidated pro forma net sales and net profit for the year ended December 31, 2018, as though the acquisition dates had been as of the
beginning of the financial year were EUR 2,996.9 million and EUR 63.2 million, respectively.

**Accounting policies**

**Business acquisitions**

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the acquisition is
measured at the fair value of consideration transferred comprising of the following:

   - Fair values of the assets transferred

   - Liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquired business

   - Equity interests issued as purchase consideration

   - Fair value of any contingent consideration arrangement, and

   - Fair value of any pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary, if applicable.

Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are,
with limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair values and any non-controlling interest in the acquired
entity on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate
share of the acquired entity’s net identifiable assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and
presented as other operating expenses in the income statement with the exception of costs directly attributable to
the issuance of equity instruments that are deducted from equity, net of tax. Any excess of the consideration
transferred over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.

**Business disposals**

Gains or losses arising from the sale of business are recognized as other operating income or other operating
expenses. Intangible and tangible assets with definite useful lives are tested for impairment if there are indicators
of impairment, see more information on triggering events in note 12.

**Accounting estimates and judgements**

The application of the acquisition method requires certain estimates and assumptions to be made, especially
concerning the fair values of the acquired intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and the liabilities
assumed at the acquisition date, and the useful lives of the acquired intangible assets and property, plant and
equipment.

Measurement is based to a large extent on anticipated cash flows. If actual cash flows vary from those used
in calculating fair values, this may materially affect the Group’s future results of operations. In particular, the
estimation of discounted cash flows for e.g. customer relationships, technology based assets as well as
trademarks and tradename are based on assumptions concerning, for example:

   - Assumptions related to long-term sales projections and margin development

   - Determination of appropriate discount rates

   - Estimates related to customer retention rates

   - Estimates related to appropriate market based royalty rates

**Business areas**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s CEO assisted by the Executive Management Team is the Group’s chief operating
decision maker (“CODM”) and operating segments are determined on the basis of information reviewed by the
CEO for the purposes of allocating resources and assessing the business area’s performance. The business area’s
performance is assessed internally based on net sales and comparable EBITDA. Comparable EBITDA is defined
for internal management reporting purposes as operating result before depreciation, amortization and
impairments and excluding items affecting comparability. Ahlstrom-Munksjö defines items affecting
comparability being material items outside ordinary course of business, such as gains and losses on business
disposals, direct transaction costs related to business acquisitions, costs for closure of business operations and
restructuring including redundancy payments, one-off items arising from purchase price allocation such as
inventory fair value adjustments, compensation related to environmental damages arising from unexpected or
rare events and other items including fines (such as VAT tax audit fines) or other similar stipulated payments and
litigations.

For the year 2018 following the acquisitions of Expera and Caieiras, the business area’s performance is
assessed internally based on pro forma net sales and pro forma comparable EBITDA. For internal management
reporting purposes, pro forma net sales measure is defined as reported net sales and pro forma net sales impact of
the acquisitions of Expera and Caieiras. Pro forma comparable EBITDA measure is defined as operating result
before depreciation, amortization and impairments and excluding items affecting comparability and pro forma
comparable EBITDA impact of the acquisitions of Expera and Caieiras. Pro forma impact of the acquisitions of
Expera and Caieiras is presented for internal management reporting purposes as if Expera and Caieiras had been
consolidated to full year results for the year 2018.

In addition to pro forma comparable EBITDA, the CODM also follows the segment’s net asset position
based on the operating working capital which is defined as inventories plus operative receivables before factoring
less operating payables.

Sales between the business areas are invoiced at market prices. None of Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s individual
customers accounts for more than 10 per cent of the Group’s revenues.

**Accounting policies**

**Revenue recognition**

IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers standard defines a five-step model to recognize revenue
arising from contracts with customers. The core principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity should recognize revenue
to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers an amount that reflects the consideration to
which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Under IFRS 15, an entity
recognizes revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied, i.e. when ‘control’ of the good or service
underlying the particular performance obligation is transferred to the customer.

The Group is delivering goods to the customers where each good provided to the customer is distinct from
the other goods provided to the customer. A typical good consist of a packed sheet of paper, a roll of paper or a
cube of pulp, which each represent a distinct performance obligation. The Group does not provide material
services. Sale of goods is the revenue stream of the Company that consists of the following business areas:
Decor, Filtration and Performance, Industrial Solutions, North America Specialty Solutions and Specialties.

A typical contract with customer consists of purchase order and order confirmation, including the general
terms and conditions of the arrangement.

The Group provides standard assurance-type warranties only and consequently the customer contracts do
not include any service-type warranties that should be accounted for as a separate performance obligation.

The transaction price may include variable consideration components, including volume and cash discounts
and refunds. Revenue from these sales is recognised based on the price specified in the contract, net of the
estimated discounts and refunds. Accumulated experience is used and provide for the discounts and customer
refunds, using the expected value method, and revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is highly probable
that a significant reversal will not occur.

Revenue is recognised at a point in time when control of goods has been transferred to the customer based
on Incoterms.

**6 OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES**

Other operating expenses represents the costs of production incurred by the Group in the manufacture and
sale of its product offerings excluding the cost of materials and supplies and employee benefit expenses.
Depreciation, amortization and any impairment charges are reported separately from these operating expenses.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**6 OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES (Continued)**

The largest component of other operating expenses is energy costs, which are incurred in the production
process. The Group obtains a part of its energy requirements from co-generation power plants and in-house
power facilities. Energy is generally purchased from regional suppliers, and the Group aims to decrease its risk of
price sensitivity through coordinated purchasing, fixed-price contracts and energy savings in the mills.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**7 EMPLOYEE AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS REMUNERATION (Continued)**

**Share-based payments**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s CEO, Executive Management Team members and a number of key employees
participate in share-based long-term incentive plans which are established on a recurring basis to align the
interests of the shareholders and management.

**Ahlstrom-Munksjö Long-term Incentive Share-based Plans**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s Board of Directors decided on October 24, 2017 to introduce a rolling long-term sharebased incentive plan for members of the Group’s key personnel with the aim of aligning the objectives of the
owners and key personnel to increase the Group’s value and to commit the key personnel to the Group. At the
end of December 2019, there are three ongoing performance periods.

In March 2019 the Board of Directors also decided, in addition to the rolling long-term share-based
incentive plan on the establishment of a fixed matching share plan as well as on the establishment of a new
restricted share plan as a complementary share-based incentive structure for specific situations.

**Rolling long-term share based incentive programme**

The rolling long-term share based incentive plan consists of a rolling structure of individual plans, each with
a three-year performance period:

   - The first performance period for 2017-2019 (“LTI 2017-2019”) was decided by the Board of Directors
in October, 2017. The performance conditions described below were not met and thus no reward will
be paid out in 2020.

   - In addition to the 2017-2019 performance period, the Board of Directors of Ahlstrom-Munksjö decided
in October, 2017 of a one off Bridge Plan. The Bridge Plan included one performance period
comprising of the years 2017-2018. The performance conditions described below were not met and
thus no reward will be paid out in 2020.

   - The second performance period is 2018-2020 (“LTI 2018-2020”) that was decided by the Board in
February, 2018. The possible reward will be paid out in 2021 in the form of shares, provided that the
below desribed performance and service conditions are met.

   - The third performance period is 2019-2021 (“LTI 2019-2021”) that was decided by the Board in
March, 2019. The possible reward will be paid out in 2022 in the form of shares, provided that the
below mentioned performance and service conditions are met.

**_Performance conditions_**

In order for the rewards to qualify for vesting, both of the following performance conditions will need to be
met over the performance periods.

   - Total shareholder return (TSR) is a market condition and is based on the share price at the end of the
performance period. This will need to exceed the minimum threshold set by the Board of Directors in
order for the condition to be met. A market condition is taken into account when estimating the grant
date fair value and therefore, the expense is recognised irrespectively of whether this market condition
is satified.

   - Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s cumulative comparable EBITDA over the performance period will need to exceed
an underlying comparable EBITDA requirement. This is a non-market performance condition. A
performance condition other than market condition is not taken into account when estimating the grant
date fair value. If the condition is not met, then it will result in a true up of the cumulative share-based
payment cost.

**_Service condition_**

In addition to the performance conditions, in order for the rewards to vest, the participant will need to be
employed by Ahlstrom-Munksjö at the time when the reward is paid.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**7 EMPLOYEE AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS REMUNERATION (Continued)**

Service condition as well as the probability of achieving the comparable EBITDA performance criteria are
used to calculate the annual expense and cumulative amount recognized in equity relating the share-based
payment scheme.

**Other long-term incentive share based plans**

**_Matching Share Plan_**

The Matching Share Plan is a one-off plan, which covers the years 2019—2021. A precondition of an
eligible individual’s participation in the plan is the individual’s personal investment in shares of AhlstromMunksjö. In the Matching Share Plan the participant will receive one matching share for each invested share free
of charge after an approximately three-year restriction period in the year 2022 provided that the participant
continues to own the invested shares and that the employment relationship of the participant with AhlstromMunksjö still continues.

Service condition is used to calculate the annual expense and cumulative amount recognized in equity
relating the share-based payment scheme.

**_Restricted Share plan_**

The Restricted Share Plan consists of annually commencing individual restricted share plans, each with a
three-year retention period after which the share rewards granted within the plan will be paid to the participants
in shares of Ahlstrom-Munksjö.

The commencement of each individual plan is subject to a separate Board approval and no individual plans
have been approved by the Board at the end of December 2019.

**Accounting policies**

**Share-based payments**

The long term incentive share based plans are accounted for as share-based payments whereby employees in
exchange for providing services receive Ahlstrom-Munksjö shares. Ahlstrom-Munksjö has classified these
programs as equity-settled as it is the Group’s intention to settle the rewards in the form of shares.

Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s share-based payments include both market and non-market performance conditions.
The Group calculates the grant-date fair value using a probability weighted value model to reflect the probability
of not achieving the TSR (market) conditions. The expense is recognized irrespectively of whether the conditions
are satisfied. The comparable EBITDA performance criteria (non-market performance condition) and the
requirement to stay in service are not factored into the grant date fair value. If the EBITDA criteria or the service
condition is not met, the cumulative share-based payment cost will be trued-up accordingly.

The share-based cost related to equity-settled schemes is recognized by the Group under Employee benefit
expenses in the income statement. The total cost is determined by reference to the fair value at grant-date and is
recognized over the expected vesting period. At each balance sheet date, Ahlstrom-Munksjö revises the
cumulative share-based cost expected to be paid out based on the likelyhood of achieving the comparable
EBITDA performance criteria and the estimated retention rate of participants at the end of the performance
period.

-----

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**7 EMPLOYEE AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS REMUNERATION (Continued)**

The rewards will be settled by the Group, net of taxes that will be withheld. From January 1, 2018 onwards,
new guidance has been introduced that enables net settled schemes to be treated as equity settled.

**Matching share plan**

The share-based cost related to the maching share plan is recognized under Employee benefit expenses in
the income statement. The total cost is determined by reference to the fair value at grant-date and is recognized
over the expected vesting period. The fair value is determined on the grant date. Expected dividends during the
vesting period have been deducted from the value of the share. The requirement to stay in service is not factored
into the grant date fair value. If the service condition is not met, the cumulative share-based payment cost will be
trued-up accordingly.

**Accounting estimates and judgements**

The long term incentive share based plans have been accounted for as equity settled share-based payments.
This is based on a judgment made by the Group that the plans will be rewarded in the form of shares and not
settled in cash.

The fair value of the rewards granted in the long term incentive share based plans have been estimated at the
grant-date based on the probability of TSR reaching specific thresholds at the end of the performance period. In
order to calculate the probabilities, the most important assumptions that have been made in the probability
weighted value model comprise of required rate of return and annual TSR volatility.

The expense recognized in Employee benefit expenses is based on management’s estimate of the likelyhood
of achieving the combarable EBITDA performance criteria and the estimated number of participants remaining
in the scheme when the vesting period ends.

At the end of each period, management estimates the likelyhood of achieving the comparable EBITDA
performance criteria and the expected retention rate for participants in order to calculate the expense for the
current period and the change in the amount recognised in equity. In order to estimate the likelyhood fo
achieving the comparable EBITDA criteria management considers the Group’s comparable EBITDA
performance against the target to date and the forecast for the remainder of the performance period.

Management estimate the number of participants that they expect to remain in the scheme at the end of the
vesting period by reviewing the number of participants remaining at the end of each period, and the expected
number of these participants who will remain at the pay-out date, considering the historic rate of staff retention in
the Group.

estimated useful life of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and ROU assets, adjusted in appropriate
cases by impairments. The useful lives are estimated as the period over which the Group will derive a benefit
from the asset.

Goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are considered as non-depreciable assets.
For non-depreciable assets, impairment tests are performed annually, as well as if there are any indications of
impairments during the year, by calculating the assets recovery value. For more information on the impairment of
goodwill and other intangible assets see note 12.

**Accounting policies**

**Current and deferred tax expense**

The income tax expense is comprised of current tax and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income
statement except when underlying transactions are reported in other comprehensive income, or directly in equity,
in which case the associated tax effect is reported in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

Current taxes are based on the results of group companies and are calculated using the local tax laws and tax
rates that are enacted or substantively enacted as of each reporting date. The Group files tax returns in several
jurisdictions and evaluates regularly tax positions taken. Tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions are recognized
when it is considered that certain tax positions will be challenged or have already been challenged by tax
authorities.

Deferred tax is calculated using the liability method on temporary differences between the carrying amounts
and taxable values of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is not recognised for temporary differences that arise on
initial recognition of goodwill or the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction other than a
business combination that do not affect either the accounting or taxable profit at the time of the transaction.

Deferred tax is not recognized for temporary differences that arise on investments in subsidiaries where the
reversal is in the Group’s control and not expected in the foreseeable future.

The valuation of deferred tax provided is based on how carrying amounts of assets or liabilities are expected
to be realized or settled. Deferred tax is calculated by applying the tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at
the reporting date.

Deferred tax assets for tax-deductible temporary differences and loss carry forwards are recognized only to
the extent it is likely that they will be utilized.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**10 TAXES (Continued)**

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legal right to offset current tax assets and
liabilities, and when the deferred tax assets and tax liabilities are attributable to taxes charged by the same tax
authority and relate to either the same tax entities or different tax entities, where there is an intention to settle the
balances on a net basis.

**Accounting estimates and judgements**

The utilization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and generation of
future taxable profits. The Group estimates possibilities to use deferred tax assets based on current business
plans. The Group periodically evaluates status of ongoing tax audits and disputes and positions taken in tax
returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It makes a
revaluation of the amounts recorded, where appropriate, on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax
authorities. Because the Group operates in complex international tax environment, significant degree of
judgement is used in identifying outcomes of tax audits and disputes and uncertain tax positions.

**11 EARNINGS PER SHARE**

The total number of shares at the end of December 2019 is 115,653,315. In December 2018, in connection
with the rights issue, 19,214,742 new shares were issued. The comparative period presented, does not represent a

**Accounting policies**

Earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the parent
company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. The accumulated
interest expenses on hybrid bond after taxes for the period is deducted in the earnings per share calculation. The
dilutive effect of equity settled share based payments is included in the computation of diluted earnings per share.

**ASSETS (Continued)**

**Goodwill**

The carrying value of goodwill amounted to EUR 642.7 million (EUR 630.6 million) as of December 31,
2019.

Ahlstrom-Munksjö is organized into five business areas which are Decor, Filtration and Performance,
Industrial Solutions, North America Specialty Solutions and Specialties. These five business areas form the
Group’s reportable segments. Goodwill is allocated to the business areas reflecting their share of the deemed fair
values of the acquired assembled workforce, expected synergies and other benefits. These five business areas
correspond to the groups of cash-generating units (CGU) and the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for
internal management purposes. See note 4 for business area information.

The following table presents the allocation of goodwill to Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s business areas (groups of

**Impairment tests for goodwill**

The recoverable amounts of each group of cash-generating units are determined using a discounted cash
flow model (value-in-use). Key assumptions used in the determination include short-term and long-term growth
rate for net sales, development of EBITDA, annual capital expenditure, changes in operative working capital and
pre-tax discount rate.

The cash flows are based on business plans approved by the Board of Directors covering a period of three
years. Cash flows beyond this three-year period are based on the terminal value and have been extrapolated using
an estimated long-term sales growth rate of 2.0% considering inflation. All cash flow projections reflect the past
performance of the Group’s business operations and management expectations for future market development
considering the external sources of information when available.

The discount rate used in the calculation is based on weighted average cost of capital (WACC) based on the
market view of the time-value of money and reflect specific risks related to each business area.

The following table sets out the key assumptions for the groups of CGUs:

The impairment tests for 2019 indicated that the recoverable amount of the groups of CGUs exceeded their
carrying value and goodwill is not been impaired.

Goodwill impairment tests for 2018 did not result in a recognition of any impairment.

**Sensitivity analysis**

As a part of the performance reviews, management has performed sensitivity analysis regarding the key
assumptions. The parameters used in the impairment tests, which were the most sensitive for changes were
EBITDA margin and pre-tax discount rate. The table below shows the percentage change in the key parameters
used in the calculations that would result in the value in use being equal to the carrying value (keeping other
parameters constant). The recoverable amount of the assets tested in 2019 exceeds their carrying value by
EUR 343.4 million for Decor, EUR 1,888.9 million for Filtration and Performance, EUR 680.6 million for
Industrial Solutions, EUR 507.3 million for North America Specialty Solutions and EUR 702.2 million for
Specialties.

Management has considered and assessed reasonable possible changes for other key assumptions and has
not identified any instances that would result in a carrying amount that exceed the recoverable amount of the
groups of CGUs.

**Research and development**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö has product and process development activities focusing mainly on meeting customer
requirements in relation to product properties and adaptations. Research and development costs are expensed
except those development expenses that meet the capitalization criteria. In 2019 development costs that met
capitalization criteria and were capitalized amounted to EUR 6.5 million (EUR 3.6 million).

**Emission rights**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö participates in the European Union emission trading scheme in which it has received
free emission allowances for a defined period. Ahlstrom-Munksjö was granted 401,096 units (418,206 units) of
CO2 emission rights for the year 2019. The rights in excess of the Group’s needs have been transferred to 2020.
As of December 31, 2019, the remaining CO2 credits amounted to 98,841 units (245,324 units) and their market
value was approximately EUR 2.5 million (EUR 5.5 million).

In 2019, Ahlstrom-Munksjö has sold emission rights for EUR 2.3 million (EUR 2.7 million) and has not
bought any emission rights (EUR 0.8 million).

**Accounting policies**

**Intangible assets**

_Goodwill_

Goodwill arises from business combinations and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over
the Group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired at the acquisition date. Goodwill is an
intangible asset with an indefinite useful life. It is not amortized, but it is subject to impairment testing annually,
or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired.

For impairment testing purposes, goodwill is allocated to groups of cash-generating units reflecting the
lowest levels at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. A cash-generating unit, as
determined for the purposes of the impairment testing, is the smallest group of assets generating separately
identifiable cash inflows, which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets

(cash-generating units). The carrying value of a cash generated unit includes its share of relevant corporate assets
allocated to it on a reasonable and consistent basis.

Ahlstrom-Munksjö conducts its impairment testing by determining the recoverable amount for a group of
CGUs. The recoverable amount is defined as value-in-use according to a present value of the estimated future
cash flows. The recoverable amount is compared to the group of CGUs’ carrying value. If the carrying value
exceeds the recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
If an impairment loss is recognized, the loss is first allocated to reduce goodwill and then to reduce other assets.

Impairment is recognized as an expense in the income statement. An impairment loss recognized for
goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.

_Other intangible assets_

Customer relationships, patents and trademarks, technology related assets and other intangible assets
acquired in business combinations are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date and are subsequently
amortized on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives.

Computer software and separately acquired patents and trademarks are recorded at historical cost and
amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives.

Other intangible assets with definite useful lives are tested for impairment if there are indicators of
impairment, see more information on triggering events in Accounting policy of Property, plant and equipment.

_Research and development_

Ahlstrom-Munksjö has product and process development activities focusing mainly on meeting customer
requirements in relation to product properties and adaptations. Activities are divided into a research phase and a
development phase. Research costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in the income statement. Expenditures
on development activities are also expensed as incurred except those development expenses that meet the
capitalization criteria. Development costs arising from the development of new or significantly improved
products are capitalized as intangible assets when the costs of the development stage can be reliably determined,
the product is technically feasible and economically viable, the product is expected to produce economic benefits
and the Group has the intention and the required resources to complete the development effort. Capitalized
development costs include the costs of material, labor and testing that are directly attributable to creating,
producing and preparing the asset to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
Amortization period for capitalized development costs is 10 years.

_Emission rights_

Ahlstrom-Munksjö participates in the European Union’s Emissions Trading Scheme aimed at reducing
greenhouse gas emission and receives allowances for a defined period to emit a fixed tonnage carbon dioxide.
The Group receives allowances either free of charge from the scheme or acquires them from other participants.
The allowances received and the liability based on the actual emissions are netted. A liability is recognized if the
allowances received do not cover the actual emissions. No intangible asset is recognized for the excess of
allowances received free of charge. Gains arising from the sale of the emission right allowances are recorded in
energy costs in the income statement.

**Accounting estimates and judgements**

**Key assumptions used in goodwill impairment testing**

The management makes significant estimates and judgements in determining the level at which the goodwill
is tested and whether there are any indications of impairment.

The calculations of the value-in-use are based on cash flow projections, which require assessments and
estimates from the management. The most significant estimates concern development of net sales and EBITDA
including estimates for market prices of pulp and cost levels of main raw materials and energy as well as
determination of the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) used to discount cash flows. Management tests
the impacts of changes in significant estimates used in forecasts by sensitivity analyses as described in this note.

The new standard, IFRS 16 Leases was effective on January 1, 2019. The new standard resulted in the
recognition of the majority of Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s leases on the balance sheet and therefore
Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s assets and liabilities have increased. Right-of-use assets recognized in the balance sheet
include vehicles, forklifts, machinery and equipment, premises and land areas.

**Property, plant and equipment**

**_Impairment of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets_**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö assesses the recoverability of the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and
intangible assets with definite useful lives if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
may be impaired (a triggering event). Factors that the Group considers when it reviews indicators of impairment
include, but are not limited to:

   - Observable indications for decrease in value

   - Significant adverse changes that have taken place in the technological, market, economic or legal
environment

   - Increases in interest rates

   - Obsolescence or physical damage affecting the asset

   - Deterioration in the expected level of the asset’s performance or adverse changes impacting the way
the asset is used or expected to be used

   - Where management’s own forecasts of future net cash inflows or operating profits show a significant
decline from previous budgets and forecasts

The carrying amount of an asset is written down immediately to the asset’s recoverable amount if the
carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is determined as the higher of an asset’s
fair value less costs to sell or its value-in-use. Value-in-use is determined by discounting future cash flows
expected to be generated by the asset. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest
level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating unit).

The impairment of assets is reversed if there is an indication that it is no longer necessary, and there has
been a change in the assumptions which formed the basis of the calculation of the recoverable amount. A reversal
is only made to the extent that the asset’s carrying value after reversal does not exceed the carrying value that the
asset would have had, with a deduction for depreciation, if no impairment had been carried out.

**ASSETS (Continued)**

**_Property, plant and equipment_**

Land and land improvements include the Group’s freehold land and the landfills that the Group operates at
or near certain of its facilities in the United States. The operation of these landfills require state, federal and local
permits for construction, operation and closure and the landfills are subject to constructing final capping and
continued monitoring.

The freehold land and land improvements are recognized at cost. The cost of land improvements include the
cost of landfill preparation and excavation, construction of liners, related costs for environmental permits and
studies and the initial estimate to close, cap and care the landfill, for which the Group has made the
environmental provision (see note 16).

Property, plant and equipment are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment.
The cost includes the purchase price and expenditure directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and
condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended. Interest on borrowings directly
attributable to the purchase, construction or production of assets that take considerable time to complete are
capitalized.

Property, plant and equipment comprising parts with different useful lives are treated as separate
components of the asset. The costs incurred for replacing the part are recognized in the carrying amount of the
asset which is depreciated over the useful life of replacement. The carrying value of a property, plant and
equipment is derecognized from the balance sheet on scrapping or sale, or when no future economic benefits are
expected from use of the asset. Ordinary repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

Gains and losses arising from the sale of property, plant and equipment are recognized as other operating
income or other operating expenses.

**_Government grants_**

Government grants are recognized at fair value when there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be
received. Government grants relating to the purchase of property, plant and equipment are deducted from the cost
of the assets and accordingly reduce the depreciation of the underlying asset. Other government grants are
recognized in the income statement in the same period as the costs they are intended to compensate on a net basis
unless the grant compensates an item which has been expensed in prior years.

**_Right-of-use assets_**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö has adopted the new standard using a simplified approach and thus comparative figures
are not restated. According to IFRS 16, the measurement of the right-of-use asset and the lease liability is
determined by discounting the minimum future lease payments. Ahlstrom-Munksjö initially measures the lease
liability at the present value of the lease payments to be made over the lease term. The payments are based on the
lease contracts and respective payment schedules. Non-lease components, such as maintenance rents and other
variable components are separated from the lease liability and expensed if the non-lease components are
specified in the agreement. Open ended lease contracts and extension options are taken into account using
management’s best estimate, e.g. end date for open ended lease contracts is the most likely end date for the
contracts and the extension option is included if it is reasonably certain that the extension option will be
exercised. Right-of-use asset is initially measured equal to the lease liability and adjusted if payments relating to
agreement are done in advance or there are initial costs for the agreement. Right-of-use assets are also subject to
impairment (IAS 36). The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or the
incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing rate comprises the reference rate and credit spread for
incremental borrowing. Factors affecting the incremental borrowing rate include the length of the contract and
potential premiums for country and currency risks. The revised incremental borrowing rate is used when there
are changes in the lease term, changes in assessment of an option to purchase the asset and modifications to the
lease that are not accounted as a separate lease. A change in index or such expected changes do not result in a
revised discount rate.

After the commencement date according to IFRS 16 the following applies: lease liabilities are reduced by
lease amortization and remeasurements are made to reflect changes to the lease payments; rights-of-use assets are

measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses adjusted for remeasurements
of the lease liability. Ahlstrom-Munksjö will use available practical expedients, including the exclusion of
short-term leases with a term to maturity of less than 12 months, low-value leases and leases of intangible assets.
Payments for short-term leases, leases of low-value assets and variable lease payments not included in the
measurement of the lease liability will continue to be presented as operating expenses.

**Accounting estimates and judgements**

**Estimates and judgements related to property, plant and equipment as well as other intangible assets**

The Group has tangible and other intangible assets with definite useful lives which values are presented
above. The assets are tested for impairment when there are events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value may be impaired (a triggering event). The recoverability of these assets is based on market
assumptions and managements estimate of future cash flows. Changes in assumptions and failure to meet certain
earnings targets could result in impairment.

**Estimates and judgements related to ROU assets**

The Group has open ended lease contracts and contacts with extention options. Management uses their best
estimate according to the existing information available to evaluate the most likely end date for these types of
contracts. Changes in the estimated end dates impact the amount of ROU asset and lease liability booked in the
balance sheet.

**13 INVENTORIES**

Inventories consist of products from the Group’s five business areas—Decor, Filtration and Performance,
Industrial Solutions, North America Specialty Solutions and Specialties—in varying stages of the production
process.

**Accounting policies**

Inventories are recognized at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is calculated as
the selling price less costs attributable to the sale.

The methodology for determining the cost of inventories varies depending on the inventory class.

**Materials and supplies**

Materials and supplies are valued using the weighted average cost method. Under the weighted average cost
method, the cost of each items remaining in inventories at the period end is determined from the weighted
average of the cost of similar items at the beginning of the period and the cost of similar items purchased during
the period.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**13 INVENTORIES (Continued)**

**Finished products and Work in progress**

Finished products and work in progress are valued on a first-in, first-out basis. Costs comprise all costs that
are directly attributable to the manufacturing process, including direct material and labour, and production related
overheads (based on normal operating capacity and normal consumption of material, labour and other production
costs) and depreciation charges.

**Accounting estimates and judgements**

**Inventory obsolescence**

If the net realizable value of inventory is deemed lower than the cost, then allowance is established for
inventory obsolescence. The amount to be allocated to inventory obsolescence is based on an estimation of the
net realizable value of inventory.

**14 TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES AND TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES**

Trade receivables consists mainly of receivables from contracts with customers.

**Ageing of trade receivable**

The Group applies the simplified approach to assess the credit risk of trade receivables. The loss allowance
is measured at the estimate of the lifetime expected credit losses. The Group uses loss allowance provision matrix
to determine the expected credit loss rates. It considers historical loss rates for each ageing category and region.
The calculated loss percentage is then adjusted with the forward looking macroeconomic data. For trade
receivables not due or maximum 180 days overdue, a loss allowance of 0.0% -10.0% is made. The trade
receivables, which are overdue 181-360 days a loss allowance of 60.0% will be made and for more than 360 days
a loss allowance of 100.0% will be made. The trade receivables are partly insured and the amount that will be
received from the insurer is excluded from the calculation of the trade receivables impairment.

The ageing of trade receivable, both gross and the impaired amount, is shown in the following table.

**Credit risk**

Financial instruments that could potentially expose Ahlstrom-Munksjö to counterparty risk consist primarily
of trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments. The Group is exposed to
counterparty credit risks from financial transactions and customer credit risks.

**Financial transactions counterparty credit risk**

Financial transactions counterparty credit risk refers to the Group’s exposure under financial contracts
arising from the deterioration of the counterparties’ financial position. In order to minimize this risk, AhlstromMunksjö have the following guidelines in place in the Group Finance Policy:

   - Only entering into transactions with leading financial institutions and with industrial companies that
have a high credit rating (preferably BBB or higher).

   - Investing in liquid cash funds only with financially secure institutions or companies (preferably BBB
or higher).

   - Requiring parent company guarantees when dealing with any subsidiary of a rated company.

**Customer credit risk**

Customer credit risk is applied centrally and managed locally in each subsidiary.

**Factoring**

When seeking to finance the Group’s receivables, this shall be limited to 50% of the total accounts
receivables before factoring calculated as a rolling average for three month’s ends. Group companies may enter
into factoring, supplier finance or other corresponding financing arrangements subject to CFO approval and
according to the criteria defined in the credit exposure policy approved by the Board. All factoring or similar
arrangements are made on non-recourse basis. At the end of the reporting period the outstanding amount under
the factoring or similar arrangements was EUR 224.3 million (EUR 151.1 million). The growth during 2019 was
to a large extent due to changing the securitization liability of EUR 43.7 million reported at end of the reporting
period 2018 to factoring or similar arrangements.

**Accounting policies**

**Trade and other receivables**

Trade and other receivables are recognized at amortized cost, using the effective interest rate method, less
any impairment losses, with the exception of fair value of unrealized hedges whose treatment is discussed in note
19. The credit quality of receivables that are neither past due nor impaired has been deemed sufficient and
payments are expected to be received when the receivables are due. Any changes to the allowance for doubtful
accounts receivable are recognized as an expense in the income statement.

**Trade and other payables**

Trade and other payables represent liabilities for goods and services and are recognized at amortized cost,
using the effective interest rate method. The amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days from
initial recognition.

**15 DEFINED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS**

The Group has defined benefit plans in several countries, of which the most significant are the United States
44% of Group’s total defined benefit pension liability, United Kingdom 24%, France 11%, Germany 7% and
Sweden 6%. The plans are in accordance with local laws and practices and are funded to satisfy the local
statutory funding requirements.

Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s most significant funded defined benefit plans are in the United States and the United
Kingdom. The assets are managed by external fund managers. The funds are allocated between equities and fixed
income instruments in order to provide return at target level and limited risk profile. The valuations of the
obligations are carried out by independent qualified actuaries.

In the United States, a part of Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s employees are members Group Retirement Plan for U.S.
Employees, which is a funded defined benefit plan and the largest of the Group’s schemes in the United States.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**15 DEFINED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS (Continued)**

The plan is managed by Ahlstrom-Munksjo USA Inc.’s Pension Committee. The scheme has been closed to new
members since 2006. In addition to the Group Retirement Plan for U.S. Employees, Ahlstrom-Munksjö also
operates a number of other post-employment benefit plans in the United States, including providing
post-employment medical and life insurance benefits, retirement plans for hourly paid employees, and State
Earnings Related Pension Schemes (SERPS). These plans are predominantly unfunded.

In the United Kingdom, the Group operates a funded defined benefit plan. The pension plan is designed
according to the Definitive Trust Deed and Rules and complies with the guidelines of the UK Pension Regulator.
The pension scheme has been closed to new members since 2006 and is managed through Ahlstrom-Munksjö
Chirnside Ltd.

In France the main funded defined benefit plans operated by the group is the termination indemnity plan.
Termination indemnity plans are designed to finance the severances paid to the employees who leave the
company for retirement. Ahlstrom-Munksjö still operates other post-employment benefit plans in France which
are closed to new members for many years.

The Group’s main unfunded defined benefit plans are in Germany, Italy (TFR Trattamento di Fine
Rapporto, termination indemnity plan) and in Sweden. The pension schemes in Germany and Italy are closed for
new entrants. In Sweden, the pension cover is organized through unfunded defined benefit plans (ITP system,
Industrins och handels tilläggspension).

**Risks associated with defined benefit plans**

Through its defined benefit pension plans the Group is exposed to a number of risks.

**Changes in bond yields**

The employer’s defined benefit obligations pension liability are calculated using a discount rate which is
determined with reference to corporate bond yield as at the balance sheet date. A decrease (increase) in used
discount rates increase (decrease) the defined benefits obligations. However, a decrease (increase) in the used
discount rate yield also increases (decreases) the fair value of the assets partially offsetting the total impact of the
change in yield on the net defined benefit pension liability.

**Inflation risk**

The benefit of the plans is tied to the future pension increase, which depends on inflation and common
salary index. Higher inflation increases the benefit increase, which leads to an increase in liabilities and annual
payments to the insurance company.

If the active employee’s salary increases more than the common salary index, the amount of promised
benefit and the benefit obligation increases together with annual payments to life insurance company.

**Life expectancy**

Longevity risk arises in case the actual timing of mortality differs from the assumed. Possible adjustments in
mortality assumption have an effect on the employer’s liability.

**Accounting policies**

**Defined benefit obligation**

The Group has various pension schemes in accordance with local practices in different countries. The
pension arrangements are classified as either defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans. The schemes are
mostly funded through payments to insurance companies or trustee-administered funds according to local
regulations. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group and usually also the employees
pay fixed contributions to an insurance company. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay
further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay the pension benefits to the employees.
Contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognized as expense in the period when they incur. All
pension plans which do not meet the criteria for defined contribution plans are defined benefit plans. Defined
benefit plans typically define a fixed amount of benefit that an employee will receive after retirement and which
the company is responsible for.

The Group’s net obligation of defined benefit plans is calculated and recorded separately for each pension
scheme based on calculations prepared by independent actuaries. The present value of defined benefit obligations
is determined using the projected unit credit method. The net liability recognized in the balance sheet is the
present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of the plan
assets. The discount rate used to determine the present value of the defined benefit obligation is equal to the yield
on high quality corporate bonds or, if not available, government bonds.

The interest rates of the high quality corporate bonds are determined in the currency in which the benefits
will be paid with a similar maturity to the obligation.

The Group’s net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits, other than pension benefits, is the
amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.

**Accounting estimates and judgements**

Pension calculations under defined benefit plans include several factors that rely on management estimates:
the discount rate used in calculating pension expenses and obligations for the period, the rate of salary increase
and the rate of future discretionary bonuses decided by the insurance company. Changes in these assumptions can
significantly impact the amounts of pension liability and future pension expenses.

**Accounting policies**

A provision is recognized when a present legal or constructive obligation exists as a result of a past event
and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be
reliably estimated. Provisions are split between amounts expected to be settled within 12 months on the balance
sheet (current) and amounts expected to be settled later (non-current).

**Restructuring**

A provision for restructuring is only recognized when a formal plan has been approved and the
implementation of the plan has either commenced or the plan has been announced.

**Environmental**

Environmental provisions are recorded based on current interpretations of environmental laws and
regulations. Such provisions are recognized when it is probable that an obligation has arisen and that the amount
of the obligation can be reliably measured. The amount recognized is the present value of the estimated future
expenditure determined in accordance with local conditions and requirements.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**16 PROVISIONS (Continued)**

**Accounting estimates and judgements**

**Environmental**

The estimates used in determining the provisions for environmental costs are based on management’s
expectations of, for example:

   - Timing and scope

   - Future cost levels

   - Laws and regulations enacted at time of the restoration works

The timing of the environmental costs depends on the expected useful lives of the Group’s sites. These
range from 50 – 70 years. In measuring the future cost levels, the Group estimates future costs and adjusts these
for the effect of inflation, cost-base development and discounting. The estimated costs are based on current laws
and regulations in place at the time of making the provision.

The Group utilizes a third party consultant to estimate both the closure and long-term care costs for the
landfills. The estimate is based on the area finally to be capped and the capping materials and activities required
along with the permit and regulatory requirements for closure and post-closure maintenance. These costs are
reviewed periodically by the Group’s environmental experts and by a third party consultant.

Because actual outflows can differ from estimates due to changes in law, regulations, public expectations,
technology, prices and conditions, and can take place many years in the future, the carrying amounts of
provisions are regularly reviewed and adjusted to take into account any such changes. The discount rate used is
reviewed annually.

##### Net debt and capital management

This section outlines the Group’s net debt and how Ahlstrom-Munksjö manages its capital including
liquidity management. The Group’s objective when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to
continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other
stakeholders, and maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

In order to maintain or adjust the Group’s capital structure, the Group uses different means such as adjust
the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, issue new shares, refinance its debt or sell assets to reduce debt.
Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s monitors capital based on the gearing ratio with a target below 100%. At the end of 2019
the ratio was 71.8% (82.8%).

**17 NET DEBT**

Net debt is Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s key measure to evaluate the total external debt financing of the Group. Net
debt is defined as borrowings less cash and cash equivalents and the securitization liability. The Group’s sources
of borrowing for funding and liquidity purposes are primarily bank loans and bonds. The Group has also entered
into a number of lease liabilities to secure the availability of assets used in the production process.

**Borrowings**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s bank loans include several facilities. These facilities consist mainly of, in original
nominal amounts, a term facility of EUR 200 million maturing in 2021; a multicurrency revolving credit facility
of EUR 200 million and term facilities in EUR, SEK and USD totaling to approximately EUR 209 million
maturing in 2022; term facilities in EUR and USD totaling to approximately EUR 339 million maturing in 2023;
and a working capital credit facility of BRL 330 million maturing in 2023.

On December 13, 2019 Ahlstrom-Munksjö issued a EUR 100 million hybrid bond. The hybrid bond does
not have a specified maturity date, but Ahlstrom-Munksjö may redeem the hybrid bonds for the first time on
February 13, 2024, or on any interest payment date thereafter. The hybrid bond is subordinated to
Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s other debt obligations and treated as equity in the IFRS financial statements. The hybrid
bond bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.879 percent per annum until February 13, 2024. More information about
the hybrid bond can be found on note 18. The proceeds from the hybrid bond issue were used to partly repay and
refinance the EUR 200 million term facility maturing on 2021.

During 2018, to finance the Expera acquisition that took place on October 10, 2018 (see note 3), the
company withdrew a EUR 155.2 million bridge-to-equity facility and a EUR 167.0 bridge-to-loan facility under
the Bridge Facilities Agreement, and a USD 260.0 million facility (“Facility B”) and a EUR 108.0 million
facility (“Facility A”) under the Term Facilities Agreement. The latter one was used to prepay the outstanding
loans under the existing Facility C (EUR 150 million facility) under the Facilities Agreement and the Facility C
was cancelled in full. On November 1, 2018 the Group entered into a EUR 200.0 million term facility agreement
with Nordea and SEB as lenders which was used to repay the EUR 167.0 bridge-facility under the Bridge
Facilities Agreement and the revolving loan of EUR 40.0 million withdrawn under the facilities agreement
complemented with a cash payment. Facility A is repaid on a semi-annual instalments of EUR 5 million that
started on May 31, 2019 and the Facility B will be repaid in at maturity, which is October 10, 2023 for both. The
bridge-to-equity was repaid on December 27, 2018 using the proceeds from the rights issue (see note 18).

Furthermore, during 2018 Ahlstrom-Munksjö assumed in the Expera acquisition a securitization liability
presented within current borrowings in the balance sheet. The financing received under this arrangement
amounted to EUR 43.7 million as at December 31, 2018. Securitization liability was repaid and cancelled in full
on April 17, 2019.

To finance the Caieiras acquisition, the Group withdrew a BRL 330.0 million loan on October 10, 2018 (see
note 3). The loan will mature in 2023.

**Interest rate risk**

Interest rate risk refers to the risk that changes in interest rates would have a negative effect on the result of
the Group and could affect the long-term competitiveness of Ahlstrom-Munksjö. There is a risk of interest

rates moving both upwards and downwards. However, in accordance with the loan terms, the reference rates in
the Group’s bank loans have a interest rate floor at zero. Accordingly, if the reference rates are below zero, the
Group’s interest payments correspond to the margin.

Most of the Group’s bank loans are at variable interest rates, which for loans denominated in euros is in
essence fixed when the reference interest rate is below zero, due to the interest rate floor in the bank loans. The
bond is a fixed rate borrowing. The average maturity of the total debt portfolio, excluding hybrid bond and lease
liabilities, is currently 8 months (10 months).

Consideration is taken at all times to assess how vulnerable the Group is to a change in interest rates. In
order to limit the impact of movements in interest rates, the Treasury Policy provides the following guidelines:

   - Aim is to achieve an average maturity of the interest rates in the debt portfolio, including the interest
rate derivatives, of 2 years +/-1 year or in accordance with the loan agreement if so specified.

   - Interest maturities are preferably spread out evenly over time in order to avoid substantial risk
concentrated on single financial year.

More information on how Ahlstrom-Munksjö manages its financial risks is presented in note 19.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**17 NET DEBT (Continued)**

EUR 45.7 million (EUR 34.8 million) of cash balances that are subject to regulatory restrictions or other
limitations, and are therefore not immediately available to the other entities of the Group. In 2018, the reported
restricted cash EUR 0.7 million included only escrow account balances.

**Accounting policies**

**Borrowings**

Bonds, bank loans and loans from multilateral institutions are recognized at their inception at their fair value
(typically the proceeds received) net of directly related transaction costs incurred. The borrowings are
subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Transaction costs are amortized
over the life of the borrowings based on the effective interest method.

**Facility fees**

Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognized as transaction costs of the credit facilities
and facility loans to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case,
the fee is deferred until the draw down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or
all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalized as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortized
over the period of the facility to which it relates.

**Derecognition of borrowings**

Borrowings are removed from the balance sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged,
cancelled or expired. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability that has been
extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred
or liabilities assumed, is recognised in profit or loss within financial items.

**Lease liabilities**

For the accounting policy please see note 12.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, deposits held at call with financial institutions, other
short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible
to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Bank overdrafts, as
applicable, are shown within borrowings in current liabilities in the balance sheet. Restricted cash includes cash
balances that are subject to regulatory restrictions or other limitations, and are therefore not immediately
available to the other entities of the Group.

**18 EQUITY**

The Board of the Directors of Ahlstrom-Munksjö together with the management of the Group considers
appropriate financial targets for Ahlstrom-Munksjö and agrees on a financial target framework. According to the
long-term financial targets approved by the Board of Directors, Ahlstrom-Munksjö aims for a stable and annually
increasing dividend to be paid to shareholders several times a year.

In 2019, the Company paid dividends to its shareholders totaling to EUR 59.9 million (EUR 50.0 million)
paid in two installments in April and in October. The Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting
that a dividend of EUR 59.9 million, EUR 0.52 per share, will be paid to shareholders in four different
installments, three during the year 2020 (April, July and October) and the last installment in January 2021.

**Hybrid bond**

On December 13, 2019 Ahlstrom-Munksjö issued a EUR 100 million hybrid bond. The hybrid bond does
not have a specified maturity date, but Ahlstrom-Munksjö may redeem it for the first time on February 13, 2024,
or on any interest payment date thereafter. It bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.879 percent per annum until
February 13, 2024. The proceeds from the hybrid bond issue were used to partly repay and refinance the EUR
200 million term facility maturing on 2021. The hybrid bond will be subordinated to Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s debt
obligations and is treated as equity in Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s consolidated financial statements prepared in
accordance with IFRS. The hybrid bond does not confer their holder the rights of a shareholder and does not
dilute the holdings of the current shareholders.

The hybrid bond includes a disposal event call option, entitling Ahlstrom-Munksjö to redeem the hybrid
bond in a disposal event where the related aggregate disposal proceeds are equal or greater than the outstanding
aggregate amount of the hybrid bond. In such event, Ahlstrom-Munksjö is entitled to redeem the hybrid bond in
whole, but not in part, on the first anniversary following the hybrid bond issue date and at any time thereafter at
103 percent of their nominal amount together with accrued interest to the date of redemption.

**Accounting policies**

**Treasury shares**

The parent company’s shares that are acquired are recognized as a reduction of equity at cost of acquisition,
including any directly attributable costs (net of tax). When the shares are cancelled or reissued, the acquisition
cost of treasury shares is recognized in retained earnings.

**Cumulative translation adjustment**

Translation differences consist of translation differences arising from translation of foreign Group
companies’ assets and liabilities into euro, the presentation currency of the consolidated financial statements. On
disposal of all or a part of a foreign Group company, the cumulative amount of translation differences is
recognized as income or expense in the income statement when the gain or loss on disposal is recognized.

**Reserve for invested unrestricted equity**

Any consideration received for the issue of new shares or treasury shares of the parent company is
recognized to reserve for invested unrestricted equity unless otherwise decided. Transaction costs directly related
to the issue of these shares are recognized, net of tax, in the reserve for invested unrestricted equity as a reduction
in the proceeds.

**Hedging reserve**

The hedging reserve comprises the unrealized fair value changes of cash flow hedges, net of taxes,
qualifying for hedge accounting and the amount recognized is reclassified in profit or loss when the hedged item
affects the profit or loss. See note 19 for more information on cash flow hedges.

**Hybrid bond**

The hybrid bond is is treated as equity in the consolidated financial statements. Interest on the hybrid bond
is not accrued but is recorded in the consolidated financial statements in retained earnings, net of taxes, after
dividend approved by the Annual General Meeting. The arrangement fees are recorded in retained earnings.

**Retained earnings**

The following are recorded directly to retained earnings:

   - The Group has certain long-term incentive plans for key personnel. These plans are accounted for as
share-based payments where the fair value of the awards granted in shares are classified as equitysettled and recorded in the income statement and retained earnings in equity over the vesting period.
See note 7 for more information on share-based payments.

   - The Group has a hybrid bond. Interest on hybrid bond is charged to retained earnings as well as the
related arrangement fees.

   - The Group has defined benefit plans. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments
and changes in actuarial assumptions for these defined benefit plans are charged or credited to retained
earnings. See note 15 for more information on defined benefit obligations.

##### Financial risk management

This section discusses the Group’s exposure to various financial risks, explains how these affect AhlstromMunksjö’s financial position and performance and how management manages the risks.

This section also describes the Group’s financial instruments and the risk exposures, sensitivities and
monitoring strategies related to these financial instruments.

**19 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT**

**General**

Financial risks of the Group consist of credit risk (see note 14), funding risk, liquidity risk and market risks.
Market risks are further divided to currency risk, interest rate risk (refer to note 17) and commodity risk.

The Treasury Policy sets the Board of Directors’ guidelines on how finance and treasury operations are
carried out and how financial risks within the Group are managed. The guidelines aim to ensure that the Group’s
financial risks are kept at an acceptable level.

The Treasury Policy is approved by the Board of Directors of Ahlstrom-Munksjö. The Board of Directors
has the overall responsibility for managing financial risks. Executive Treasury Committee monitors and manages
the financial risks. Operational management of financial risks is carried out centrally by the Group Treasury
under the Treasury Policy. Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation
with the Group’s operating units.

Group Treasury is handling all hedging of foreign exchange, commodity and interest rates, if nothing else
has been approved. Where all relevant criteria are met, hedge accounting is applied to remove the accounting
mismatch between the hedging instrument and the hedged item.

**Currency risk**

Due to the global operations of Ahlstrom-Munksjö, the Group is exposed to currency risk. Currency risk
refers to the risk that fluctuations in the foreign exchange market will negatively affect the Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s
cash flow, net profit and equity. Currency exposure, defined as all unhedged exposure in foreign currency, is split
into two types of exposure: transaction exposure and translation exposure.

F-134


-----

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**19 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (Continued)**

**Transaction exposure**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö conducts manufacturing and sells its products around the globe and is therefore exposed
to transaction risk. Transaction exposure arises from commercial and finance-related transactions and payments
in a currency other than an operation’s functional currency i.e. from internal purchases, sales between
manufacturing units and market companies, external sales and purchases as well as from financing transactions in
foreign currencies.

Also firm commitments to acquire businesses may expose the Group to foreign currency transaction risk. In
2018 the Group hedged a portion (USD 300 million nominal) of the USD denominated firm commitment to
acquire Expera in latter part of 2018 by using a foreign exchange forward contract. The gain on hedge amounted
to EUR 4.4 million which was recorded as an adjustment to the purchase consideration (see note 3 for further
information on the acquisition of Expera).

Foreign currency cash flows are hedged on a net exposure basis in accordance with the rules set out in the
Treasury Policy. The Group’s risk management strategy in terms of currency risk is to hedge 75% (+/-10%) of
the forecasted cash flows for a period up to 9 months if the total exposure to forecasted net flows of foreign
currency exceeds the equivalent of 2% of the total turnover of the company. The Group uses forward contracts to
hedge this commercial foreign currency exposure and applies cash flow hedge accounting. The forward
contracts’ maturity is materially reconciled with the timing of the forecasted sales and purchases. At
December 31, 2019, the fair value of the forwards under hedge accounting was EUR 1.3 million. In 2019, the
Group booked gain of EUR 3.2 million to the cash flow hedge transferred to this year’s result in OCI. The Group
has not historically booked material ineffectiveness from the hedging relationships, however, ineffectiveness
might arise from timing differences.

In addition to using derivatives for hedging, Ahlstrom-Munksjö also employs practical actions in order to
reduce the currency risk. The number of currencies used in intercompany invoicing is minimized and where
possible, Group Treasury will match foreign exchange cash flows within the Group.

The following tables show the Group’s exposure to currency cash flow risk.

At the end of the reporting period, the hedge ratio for the forecasted cash flows for the next 9 months,
including indirect exposure embedded in pulp prices, was approximately 74% (December 31, 2018: 75%) for
USD and about 67% for SEK (December 31, 2018: 70%). The exposures in other currencies are limited and not
hedged. Outstanding nominal amounts at the end of the year for these forward contracts were USD 27 million
and SEK 720 million.

The following table shows the Group’s estimated sensitivity for the next 9 months to a currency rate of a
weaker EUR of 5%, including FX-hedges and indirect exposures. The table is based on information monitored by
the Board for currency risk management.

The parent company has provided financing (or received deposits) to (from) its foreign subsidiaries which
have been hedged by using forward contracts at December 31, 2019. Hedge accounting is not applied to these
relationships. The nominal amounts of the loans are USD 5 million, CNY 25 million, and GBP 20 million, the
nominal amount of the deposit is JPY 631 million. These amounts correspond to the nominal amounts of the
forward contracts, which have a maturity of three months and are adjusted according to the open balances. These

F-135


-----

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**19 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (Continued)**

forward contracts are recognised at fair value with changes in fair value through the exchange gains and losses
within the financial items. The fair value for the forwards was EUR -0.1 million at December 31, 2019.

**Translation risk**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s income statement and balance sheet are both exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations,
as these affect the translation of subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.

The Group aims to minimize currency risk related to translation exposure by aiming to balance assets and
liabilities of subsidiaries so that the foreign exchange risk is minimized in the consolidated balance sheet. Due to
the long-term nature of net investments, equity hedging is not normally performed by the Group.

The following table shows the Group’s translation exposure arising from net investments in foreign
subsidiaries in major currencies. For 2018, the table includes also a USD denominated intercompany loan (USD
365 million) that is accounted for as part of the net investment in a US subsidiary. The loan was converted to
equity during 2019.

**Accounting policies**

**Derivative instruments and hedging activities**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö uses derivative instruments to manage certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign
currency rates and interest rates. These derivative financial instruments are recognized initially at fair value on
the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are
carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.

Hedge accounting is applicable when, at inception of the hedge, there is a formal designation and
documentation of the hedging relationship and other criteria for hedge accounting are met. At inception of the
hedge relationship, the Group documents the economic relationship between hedging instruments and hedged
items including whether changes in the cash flows of the hedging instruments are expected to offset changes in
the cash flows of hedged items. The Group documents its risk management strategy and objective for
undertaking its hedge transactions.

The Group only applies cash flow hedge accounting, which is used to hedge exposure to variability in cash
flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a highly probable forecasted transaction or firm
commitment. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument is booked in other
comprehensive income and accumulated in equity. It is reclassified in profit or loss when the hedged item affects
the profit or loss, or in the initial cost of the hedged item when it relates to the hedge of a firm commitment to
acquire a non-financial item (for example, business combination). The Group does not separate forward points in
a hedge relationship.

When a hedging instrument expires, is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for
hedge accounting, any cumulative deferred gain or loss and deferred costs of hedging in equity at that time
remains in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs, resulting in the recognition of a non-financial asset such
as inventory. When the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss and

F-136


-----

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**19 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (Continued)**

deferred costs of hedging that were reported in equity are immediately reclassified to profit or loss. Subsequent
changes in the value of the hedging instrument after the hedging relationship is terminated are recorded in profit
or loss.

**Commodity risk**

Commodity risk refers to the risk that changes in the cost of raw materials (pulp, titanium dioxide) and
energy (electricity, gas, oil etc.) have a negative effect on the result and/or competitiveness of
Ahlstrom-Munksjö. Consideration as to the vulnerability of the Group to changes in relevant commodity prices is
taken periodically.

To mitigate the commodity risk exposure, the Group hedges commodity exposures in line with the Group
Treasury Policy. In accordance with the policy, commodity hedging should have a maximum length of 3 years
and can be up to 50% of forecasted consumption in the first year, 40% of forecasted consumption in the second
year and 30% in the third year. All hedging transaction are also to be connected to projects, customer agreements
or other direct identifiable business risks. This is in order to avoid speculative hedging. At the balance sheet date,
the Group did not have any outstanding commodity derivatives.

**Funding and liquidity risk**

**Funding risk**

Funding risk refers to the risk the Ahlstrom-Munksjö does not at all times have access to financing or
financing at an acceptable cost. This may arise should the Group become too dependent on a single source of
financing, or if the maturity structure of the Group’s debt portfolio is too concentrated. In order to mitigate
funding risk, the Group aims to spread its debt across different lenders, different maturities and different forms of
financing.

Ahlstrom-Munksjö has outlined the following guidelines in its Treasury Policy, which aim to mitigate the
funding risk. The Group aims to ensure that not more than 50% of its debt portfolio will mature in the same
12-month period and the average maturity of the long-term finance should be at least 2 years. The Group also
aims to avoid the inclusion of covenants in all types of financing agreements.

**Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk is the risk that Ahlstrom-Munksjö will not have sufficient funds to pay foreseen and
unforeseen expenditures. In order to mitigate this risk, Group Treasury monitors the Group’s cash pools, bank
agreements and liquidity to ensure at all times that there is sufficient liquidity. The liquidity situation is
monitored in such way that Ahlstrom-Munksjö Group at all times has sufficient liquidity. The Group’s cash
accounts are included in the cash pools.

**Financial instruments subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting agreements and similar agreements**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö have a number of counterparties in respect of which the Group is both buyer and seller.
Consequently, Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s gross financial assets can be significant before offsetting. Offsetting is
typically limited within specific products and is possible when payment and receipt from the same counterparty
occur simultaneously. These financial assets and liabilities are not offset on the balance sheet as the offsetting in
the balance sheet is allowed only in certain, limited circumstances.

The table below shows the Group’s derivative contracts that are subject to offsetting agreements. The
column ‘net amount‘ shows the impact on the Group’s balance sheet if all set-off rights were exercised. Under
the terms of these arrangements, only where certain credit events occur (such as default), the net position
owing/receivable to a single counterparty in the same currency will be taken as owing and all the relevant
arrangements terminated. As the Group does not presently have a legally enforceable right of set-off, these
amounts have not been offset in the balance sheet.

1 2018 finance lease liabilities (IAS 17)

The Group considers that the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and
trade and other payables provide a reasonable approximation of fair value, due to the short maturity and liquid
nature of these elements. In addition, the carrying amounts of non-current and current loan from financial
institutions and other loan are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate. The fair value amounts
are reasonable approximations of their carrying amounts.

**Accounting policies**

**Financial assets measured at amortised cost**

The group classifies its financial assets as at amortised cost only if both of the following criteria are met:.

   - The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash flows,

   - The contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest.

The financial assets in this group are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method if the time
value of money is significant. Gains and losses are recognized in income when the loans and receivables are
derecognized or impaired (see note 14), as well as through the amortization process. This category of financial
assets includes trade and other receivables and cash equivalents (see note 17).

**Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through income statement**

The Group classifies derivatives for which hedge accounting is not applied as financial assets at fair value
through profit or Loss (FVPL).

Financial assets at fair value through income statement are carried on the balance sheet at fair value with
gains or losses recognized in the income statement. Derivatives, other than those designated as effective hedging
instruments, are classified as held for trading and are included in this category.

Other investments include unlisted shares and interests carried at fair value. Fair value changes are
recognised in the other comprehensive income. For unlisted shares and interests the fair value cannot be
measured reliably and therefore the management considers that the cost is a reasonable approximation of the fair
value.

**Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost**

Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost are initially recognized at fair value, net of transaction costs.
For interest-bearing loans and borrowings this is the fair value of the proceeds received net of issue costs
associated with the borrowing.

F-141


-----

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**19 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (Continued)**

After initial recognition, other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the
effective interest method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or
premium on settlement. Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or cancellation of liabilities are
recognized in interest and other income and finance costs respectively.

This category of financial liabilities includes trade and other payables and debt (see note 17).

**Fair values of financial assets and liabilities**

The financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the balance sheet have been classified based on
the three hierarchy levels:

   - Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can
access at the measurement date;

   - Level 2: inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly;

   - Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

The Group considers that the carrying amount of cash, trade receivables and various deposits provide a
reasonable approximation of fair value, due to the short maturity and liquid nature of these elements.

For financial liabilities at amortized cost, the fair value of financial liabilities is determined using:

   - The quoted price for listed instruments (a detailed analysis is performed in the case of a material
decrease in liquidity to evidence whether the observed price corresponds to the fair value; otherwise the
quoted price is adjusted);

   - The present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted using rates observed by the Group at the
end of the period for lease liabilities and other instruments.

Fair values of derivatives are based on valuations provided by external parties using various valuation
techniques. The fair value of the forward exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange rates at the
balance sheet date with the resulting fair value discounted to present value.

**Commitments**

Unrecognized commitments are disclosed where the Group has an agreement or a pledge to assume a
financial obligation at a future date.

**Contingent liabilities**

Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed by uncertain future events
that are not wholly within the control of the entity. They can also include obligations that are not recognized
because their amount cannot be measured reliably or because settlement is not probable. A contingent liability is
not recognized in the statement of financial position but as off-balance sheet commitments.

**Accounting policies**

**Subsidiaries, joint operations and associates**

Subsidiaries are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by Ahlstrom-Munksjö controls, ie. when the
Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement and has the ability to affect those
returns through exercising power. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date control is achieved to the date
when the Group ceases to exercise power.

Associated companies are those in which the Group has a significant influence over operational and
financial policies. Significant influence is the power to participate in, but not control or jointly control, the
financial and operating decisions of the investee. These investments are accounted for using the equity method.

The Group recognises its direct right to the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operations and
its share of any jointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in accordance with the
Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s contractual rights and obligations.

**Transactions eliminated on consolidation and transactions between the owners of the parent**

Transactions between Group companies, including intra-group receivables and liabilities, income or
expenses and unrealized gains or losses are eliminated in full. Unrealized gains arising from transactions with
associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest, unless otherwise contractually
agreed by the parties. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains, but only to the extent
that there is no evidence of impairment. Transactions with the owners of the parent are reported within
shareholders’ equity. Transactions with non-controlling interests are reported as transactions with equity owners
of the Group. Divestments to and purchases from non-controlling interests result in gains and losses for the
Group, which are reported in equity.

**22 AUDITOR REMUNERATION**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) makes resolutions each year to elect the Group’s
auditors. It was resolved at the 2019 AGM that in accordance with the proposal of the Board that KPMG Oy Ab
would be appointed as the Group’s auditor.

##### Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s business and basis of preparation

**1 INFORMATION ABOUT AHLSTROM-MUNKSJÖ**

**General**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö is a global leader in fiber-based materials, supplying innovative and sustainable
solutions to customers worldwide. Our offerings include filter materials, release liners, food and beverage
processing materials, decor papers, abrasive and tape backings, electro technical paper, glass fiber materials,
medical fiber materials and solutions for diagnostics as well as a range of specialty papers for industrial and
consumer end-uses.

Ahlstrom-Munksjö Oyj, a Finnish public limited liability company with a corporate identity number,
2480661-5, is the parent company (“parent company”, “Ahlstrom-Munksjö Oyj”) of the Ahlstrom-Munksjö
Group (the “Group”, “Ahlstrom-Munksjö”). Ahlstrom-Munksjö is registered in Helsinki, Finland. AhlstromMunksjö’s registered address is Alvar Aallon katu 3 C, 00101 Helsinki, Finland. Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s shares are
listed on Nasdaq Helsinki and Nasdaq Stockholm.

**2 BASIS OF PREPARATION**

**Basis of preparation and accounting policies in our audited financial statements**

**Basis of preparation**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and
the interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee as approved by the Commission of the
European Communities (EU) for application in the European Union.

The following general principles have been applied to our financial statements:

   - The parent company’s functional and presentation currency is the euro (“EUR”) and financial
statements are presented in millions of euros (“EUR million”), unless otherwise indicated.

   - Financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments,
unlisted shares and interests and defined benefit pension plan assets, which are measured at fair value.

   - Non-current assets and non-current liabilities consist of amounts that are expected to be recovered or
paid more than 12 months after the reporting period. Current assets and current liabilities consist of
amounts that are expected to be recovered or paid within 12 months of the end of the reporting period.

   - All financial data in the financial statements have been rounded and consequently the sum of individual
figures can deviate from the total sum. Percentages are subject to possible rounding differences.

   - The accounting policies outlined in these financial statements have been applied consistently
throughout the Group and comparative information has been reclassified where required to ensure
consistency.

**_Foreign currency translation_**

Figures representing the financial result and position of each subsidiary in the Group are measured using the
currency of the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates (the functional currency).

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates
prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies are
translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.

Foreign exchange differences arising from the currency translation are recognized in the income statement.
Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from operating business transactions are included in operating profit,
and those arising from financial transactions are included as a net amount in financial income and expenses. The
foreign exchange gains and losses arising from the qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying hedges of a net
investment in foreign operations are recorded in the statement of other comprehensive income and accumulated
currency differences are recognized in equity.

F-156


-----

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2 BASIS OF PREPARATION (Continued)**

The balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries are translated into euros at the exchange rates prevailing at the
balance sheet date while the income statements are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
Translating the result of the period using different exchange rates on the balance sheet and income statement
causes a translation difference to be recognized in equity and its change is recorded in the statement of other
comprehensive income.

Translation differences arising from the elimination of the acquisition price of foreign subsidiaries and from
the translation differences in equity items since the acquisition date as well as the effective portion of hedging
instruments that hedge the currency exposures on net investments are recognized in the statement of other
comprehensive income. When a subsidiary is disposed or sold wholly or partially, translation differences arising
from the net investment and related hedges are recognized in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on
sale.

**_Adopted IFRS standards, amendments and improvements_**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö has applied the following standards and amendments for the first time for their annual
reporting period commencing January 1, 2018:

   - IFRS 9 Financial Instruments

   - IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers

   - Classification and Measurements of Share-based Payment Transactions—Amendments to IFRS 2

   - Annual improvements 2014-2016 cycle

   - IFRIC Interpretation 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration

The Group has changed its accounting policies following the adoption of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15.

**_IFRS 9_**

IFRS 9 was adopted without restating the comparative financial information. Under IFRS 9, the
classification and measurement of financial assets are based on the cash flow characteristics and the business
model they are managed in. The Group has categorized its financial assets to financial assets measured at
amortized cost and at fair value through profit and loss. The reclassification has not had any impact on equity.

The classification of the financial assets under IFRS 9:

**Classification under IAS 39** **Classification under IFRS 9**

Trade and other receivables Loans and receivables Amortized cost
Other investments Available-for-sale financial assets Fair value through income statement
(or other comprehensive income)
Derivatives under hedge Derivatives under hedge accounting Derivatives under hedge accounting
accounting (fair value changes through other (fair value changes through other
comprehensive income) comprehensive income)

Derivatives, non hedge Fair value through income statement Fair value through income statement
accounting

The new rules of IFRS 9 for hedge accounting align more closely with common risk management practices
and, among others, allow net position hedging. The Group applies the new hedge accounting requirements
prospectively. The Group hedges the foreign currency flows on a net exposure basis. The cash flow hedging is
applied against the expected net cash flows, consisting of related sales proceeds and purchases in the same
currency. The new rules of IFRS 9 for hedge accounting did not impact the Group’s hedging result.

According to IFRS 9 the impairment assessment of financial assets is based on expected credit loss model.
The impairment is based on forward-looking information as well as past experience and current expectations.
The Group estimates the credit risk for financial assets, mainly trade receivables, measured at amortized cost at
the end of each reporting period.

F-157


-----

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2 BASIS OF PREPARATION (Continued)**

The Group applies the simplified approach to assess the expected credit loss for trade receivables. The loss
allowance is measured at the estimate of the lifetime expected credit losses, which are recognized based on
ageing categories of trade receivables. The Group has historically low levels for realized credit losses in trade
receivables and the Group also has a credit insurance program in place. Due to the new expected credit loss
model the Group has made an adjustment of EUR -1.6 million in retained earnings and trade receivables for the
opening balance of January 1, 2018. Comparatives for 2017 are not restated.

**_IFRS 15_**

The Group adopted IFRS 15 using the full retrospective method and there were no significant accounting
changes compared to the previous practice and thus there was no impact to the financial statements (see note 5).
IFRS 15 defines a five-step model to recognize revenue arising from contracts with customers.

**_Other_**

Other amendments listed above did not have material impact on the amounts recognised in prior periods and
are not expected to significantly affect the current or future periods.

The financial statements were authorised for issue by Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s Board of Directors on
February 13, 2019 and are expected to be adopted by the Annual General Meeting on March 27, 2019.

On October 10, 2018, Ahlstrom-Munksjö completed the acquisition of U.S. specialty paper producer Expera
Specialty Solutions. Ahlstrom-Munksjö acquired 100 % of the shares. The transformative acquisition will expand
the Group’s presence in North America and further strengthen its offering of advanced custommade fiber-based
materials. The transaction will almost triple Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s net sales in the U.S. and provide a platform for
growth.

On October 17, 2018, Ahlstrom-Munksjö completed the acquisition of MD Papéis’ Caieiras specialty paper
mill in Brazil. Ahlstrom-Munksjö acquired 100 % of the shares. The acquisition significantly strengthens
Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s offering in South America and provides further growth opportunities. Prior to the closing
date of the acquisition, three new companies were created to facilitate the demerger of an existing business unit
into multiple legal entities and provide a legal entity that holds the assets and liabilities that have been acquired
by Ahlstrom-Munksjö.

**Provisional purchase consideration**

The acquisitions were paid in cash and financed with credit facility agreements, term loan and issuance of
shares. Further details on the financing of the transactions are described in note 17 and 18.

The fair value of the acquired trade receivables is EUR 62.8 million. The gross contractual amount for trade
receivables is EUR 62.9 million of which EUR 0.1 million is expected to uncollectable.

purchase consideration paid in USD which resulted in a gain of EUR 4.4 million (EUR 3,5 million net of tax)
reducing goodwill at consolidation.

The goodwill of EUR 171.8 million arising from the acquisition of Expera Specialty Solutions is attributable
to workforce, synergies and expanding the North American platform for future growth. Acquired goodwill has
been allocated to Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s North America Specilty Solutions business area. For more information

receivables is EUR 11.5 million of which EUR 1.1 million is expected to uncollectable.

The goodwill of EUR 30.1 million arising from the acquisition of MD Papéis’ Caieiras specialty paper mill
in Brazil is attributable to synergies and assembled workforce and it has been allocated to Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s
Decor and Industrial Solutions business areas. For more information about goodwill allocation and our annual
goodwill impairment tests, see note 12. It is expected that the goodwill will not be deductible for tax purposes.

Acquisition related costs of EUR 1.2 million are included in other operating expenses in the income
statement and in net cash from operating activities in the cash flow statement.

**2017**

**Merger of Ahlstrom and Munksjö**

The combination of Ahlstrom and Munksjö was announced publicly in November 2016 and structured as a
statutory absorption merger whereby Ahlstrom merged into Munksjö became effective on April 1, 2017.
Following the resolutions of the Extraordinary General Meetings of both companies on January 11, 2017, the
European Commission approved the merger and all pre-closing competition approvals required for completing
the merger were received on March 13, 2017.

The execution of the merger was registered with the Finnish Trade Register on April 1, 2017, and the name
of the combined company was changed to Ahlstrom-Munksjö Oyj. Ahlstrom’s shareholders received as merger
consideration 0.9738 new shares in Munksjö for each share in Ahlstrom owned by them and a total of 45,376,992
new shares in Ahlstrom-Munksjö were issued as merger consideration. Trading in the new shares commenced on
the Nasdaq Helsinki and Nasdaq Stockholm stock exchanges on April 3, 2017.

For accounting purposes, Munksjö was determined to gain control over Ahlstrom and as such being the
accounting acquirer based on the merger structure and facts and circumstances including the relative voting
rights received by both shareholders groups, composition of the board of directors and senior management and
the structure of the transaction whereby Munksjö is the surviving entity post-combination. Accordingly, the

**3 CHANGES IN AHLSTROM-MUNKSJÖ GROUP STRUCTURE (Continued)**

merger has been accounted for in the consolidated accounts as a business combination where Munksjö acquired
Ahlstrom on April 1, 2017.

**Purchase consideration**

The purchase consideration has been determined based on the fair value of Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s shares that
were issued to Ahlstrom’s shareholders as merger consideration in exchange for their shareholding in Ahlstrom
as follows:

Number of new Ahlstrom-Munksjö shares issued as merger consideration . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 45,376,992
Closing share price of Munksjö shares on March 31, 2017 on Nasdaq Helsinki (EUR) . . . . . . . . . 13.94

**Fair value of merger consideration (EUR million) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **632.6**

Cash portion paid to Ahlstrom’s shareholders due to fractional entitlements to the merger consideration was
immaterial. The total costs for issuance of merger consideration amounted to EUR 4.6 million (net of taxes) and
have been deducted from the reserve for invested unrestricted equity in the balance sheet.

**Purchase price allocation**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö has finalized the valuation of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. The following

**3 CHANGES IN AHLSTROM-MUNKSJÖ GROUP STRUCTURE (Continued)**

The fair values of acquired identifiable intangible assets at the date of acquisition were EUR 288.8 million,
comprising of customer relationships valued using the excess-earnings method, acquired technology based assets
comprising of process and product technology, know-how and trade secrets valued using the relief-from-royalty
method and trademarks and tradenames which have been also been valued using the relief-from-royalty method.

The goodwill arising from the merger amounted to EUR 213.7 million and reflects the value of acquired
assembled workforce and synergies raising from the merger e.g. reduction of overhead costs, reduced costs of
procurement and improved operational efficiency. Acquired goodwill has been allocated to Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s
year 2017 four business areas: Decor, Filtration and Performance, Industrial Solutions and Specialties. Goodwill
is not deductible for tax purposes.

The amount of non-controlling interest recognized amounted to EUR 4.8 million and was recognized on the
proportionate goodwill method at the merger date.

The transaction and integration costs related to the merger that were not directly attributable to the share
issue amounted to EUR 14.7 million in 2017 and EUR 4.1 million in 2016.

**Accounting policies**

**Business acquisitions**

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the acquisition is
measured at the fair value of consideration transferred comprising of the following:

   - fair values of the assets transferred

   - liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquired business

   - equity interests issued as purchase consideration

   - fair value of any contingent consideration arrangement, and

   - fair value of any pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary, if applicable.

Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are,
with limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair values and any non-controlling interest in the acquired
entity on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate
share of the acquired entity’s net identifiable assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and
presented as other operating expenses in the income statement with the exception of costs directly attributable to
the issuance of equity instruments that are deducted from equity, net of tax. Any excess of the consideration
transferred over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.

**Accounting estimates and judgements**

The application of the acquisition method requires certain estimates and assumptions to be made, especially
concerning the fair values of the acquired intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and the liabilities
assumed at the acquisition date, and the useful lives of the acquired intangible assets and property, plant and
equipment.

Measurement is based to a large extent on anticipated cash flows. If actual cash flows vary from those used
in calculating fair values, this may materially affect the Group’s future results of operations. In particular, the
estimation of discounted cash flows for e.g. customer relationships, technology based assets as well as
trademarks and tradename are based on assumptions concerning, for example:

   - Assumptions related to long-term sales projections and margin development

   - Determination of appropriate discount rates

   - Estimates related to customer retention rates

   - Estimates related to appropriate market based royalty rates

**4 BUSINESS AREA INFORMATION (Continued)**

**Accounting policies**

**Business areas**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s CEO assisted by the Executive Management Team is the Group’s chief operating
decision maker (“CODM”) and operating segments are determined on the basis of information reviewed by the
CEO for the purposes of allocating resources and assessing the business area’s performance. The business area’s
performance is assessed internally based on pro forma net sales and pro forma comparable EBITDA.

For internal management reporting purposes, pro forma net sales measure is defined as reported net sales
and pro forma net sales impact of the acquisitions of Expera and Caieiras and the merger of Ahlstrom and
Munksjö. Pro forma comparable EBITDA measure is defined as operating result before depreciation,
amortization and impairments and excluding items affecting comparability and pro forma comparable EBITDA
impact of the acquisitions of Expera and Caieiras and the merger. Ahlstrom-Munksjo¨ defines items affecting
comparability being material items items outside ordinary course of business, such as gains and losses on
business disposals, direct transaction costs related to business acquisitions, costs for closure of business
operations and restructuring including redundancy payments, one-off items arising from purchase price
allocation such as inventory fair value adjustments, compensation related to environmental damages arising from
unexpected or rare events and other items including fines (such as VAT tax audit fines) or other similar stipulated
payments and litigations. Pro forma impact of the acquisitions of Expera and Caieiras in 2018 and the merger of
Ahlstrom and Munksjo¨ in 2017 is presented for internal management reporting purposes as if the acquisitions and
the merger had taken place at the beginning of the comparative financial period on January 1, 2017.

In addition to pro forma comparable EBITDA, the CODM also follows the segment’s net asset position
based on the operating working capital which is defined as inventories plus operative receivables before factoring
less operating payables.

Sales between the business areas are invoiced at market prices. None of Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s individual
customers accounts for more than 10% of the Group’s revenues.

**5 SOURCES OF REVENUE**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s revenue comprise the sale of manufactured products through its five business areas
including filter materials, release liners, food and beverage processing materials, decor papers, abrasive and tape
backings, electrotechnical paper, glass fiber materials, medical fiber materials and solutions for diagnostics as
well as a range of specialty papers for industrial and consumer end-uses.

**Accounting policies**

**Revenue recognition**

The Group has adopted the new IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers standard as of January 1,
2018. IFRS 15 defines a five-step model to recognize revenue arising from contracts with customers. The core
principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or
services to customers an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in

**5 SOURCES OF REVENUE (Continued)**

exchange for those goods or services. Under IFRS 15, an entity recognizes revenue when (or as) a performance
obligation is satisfied, i.e. when ‘control’ of the good or service underlying the particular performance obligation
is transferred to the customer.

The Group is delivering goods to the customers where each good provided to the customer is distinct from
the other goods provided to the customer. A typical good consist of a packed sheet of paper, a roll of paper or a
cube of pulp, which each represent a distinct performance obligation. The Group does not provide material
services. Sale of goods is the revenue stream of the Group that consists of the following business areas: Decor,
Filtration and Performance, Industrial Solutions, North America Specialty Solutions and Specialties.

A typical contract with customer consists of purchase order and order confirmation, including the general
terms and conditions of the arrangement. Compared to the previous accounting standard, the new standard does
not entail any change in identification of the performance obligations and accounting for the delivery of goods.

The Group provides standard assurance-type warranties only and consequently the customer contracts do
not include any service-type warranties that should be accounted for as a separate performance obligation.

The transaction price may include variable consideration components, including volume and cash discounts
and refunds. Revenue from these sales is recognised based on the price specified in the contract, net of the
estimated discounts and refunds. Accumulated experience is used and provide for the discounts and customer
refunds, using the expected value method, and revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is highly probable
that a significant reversal will not occur.

Revenue is recognised at a point in time when control of goods has been transferred to the customer based
on Incoterms.

The Group adopted IFRS 15 using the full retrospective method and there were no significant accounting
changes compared to the previous practice and thus there was no impact to the financial statements.

**6 OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES**

Other operating expenses represents the costs of production incurred by the Group in the manufacture and
sale of its product offerings excluding the cost of materials and supplies and employee benefit expenses.
Depreciation, amortization and any impairment charges are reported separately from these operating expenses.

The largest component of other operating expenses is energy costs, which are incurred in the production
process. The Group obtains a part of its energy requirements from co-generation power plants and in-house
power facilities. Energy is generally purchased from regional suppliers, and the Group aims to decrease its risk of
price sensitivity through coordinated purchasing, fixed-price contracts and energy savings in mills.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**Ahlstrom-Munksjö Long-term Incentive Share-based Plan**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s Board of Directors decided on October 24, 2017 to introduce a new rolling long-term
share-based incentive plan for approximately 65 members of the Group’s key personnel with the aim of aligning
the objectives of the owners and key personnel to increase the Group’s value and to commit the key personnel to
the Group.

The plan includes a rolling structure of individual plans, each with a three-year performance period. The
first performance period started in 2017. The commencement of performance periods is subject to the Board of
Director’s annual decision and Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s Board of Directors decided on February 12, 2018 a second
performance period. The first performance period is 2017-2019 and the possible reward will be paid out in 2020
in the form of shares, provided that certain performance and service conditions are met. The second performance
period is 2018-2020 and the possible reward will be paid out in 2021.

Depending on which levels of the performance and service condition thresholds are met, the gross EUR
value of the reward paid will be within a minimum and maximum range, with the final number of shares being
determined based on Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s share price at the end of the performance period.

**_Performance conditions_**

In order for the rewards to qualify for vesting, both of the following performance conditions will need to be
met over the performance periods. Both performance conditions are taken into account when determining the
grant date fair value and accordingly, the expense is recognized irrespectively of whether the conditions are
satisfied.

   - Total shareholder return (TSR) is a market condition and is based on the share price at the end of the
performance period. This will need to exceed the minimum threshold set by the Group in order for the
condition to be met. TSR is determined against Ahlstom-Munksjö’s volume weighted average share
price over a certain period

   - Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s cumulative comparable EBITDA over the performance period will need to exceed
an underlying comparable EBITDA requirement. This is a non-market performance condition.

**_Service condition_**

In addition to the performance conditions, in order for the rewards to vest, the participant will need to be
employed by Ahlstrom-Munksjö at the time when the reward is paid.

**Long-term Incentive Share-based Plan—Second performance period 2018-2020 (“LTI 2018-2020”)**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s Board of Directors decided on February 12, 2018 a new performance period under the
long-term share-based incentive plan announced in October 2017. The second performance period is 2018-2020
and the possible reward will be paid out in 2021.

The minimum gross value of the reward has been fixed to EUR 0.5 million and the maximum gross value
has been fixed to EUR 9.4 million, and the final reward EUR value will be converted into an equivalent number
of shares based on the trade volume weighted average price of the Ahlstrom-Munksjö share during the period of
January-February of the calendar year immediately following the last year of the performance period.

**_Rewards granted and the fair value of reward_**

The fair value of the reward at the grant date was EUR 1.5 million. The fair value is calculated based on the
probability of achieving each individual TSR threshold at the end of the performance period between the
minimum and maximum thresholds set by the Group and estimated rate of realization of EBITDA criteria.

**_Expenses arising from LTI 2018-2020 share-based payment transactions_**

The share-based expense relating to the period from the grant date (July 6, 2018) to the balance sheet date
was EUR 0.3 million.

**Long-term Incentive Share-based Plan—First performance period 2017-2019 (“LTI 2017-2019”)**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s Board of Directors decided on October 24, 2017 to introduce a new rolling long-term
share-based incentive plan. The plan includes a rolling structure of individual plans, each with a three-year
performance period. The performance period for the first reward is 2017-2019 and the possible reward will be
paid out in 2020 in the form of shares, provided that certain performance and service conditions are met.

The minimum gross value of the reward has been fixed to EUR 0.3 million and the maximum gross value
has been fixed to EUR 6.9 million, and the final reward EUR value will be converted into an equivalent number
of shares based on the trade volume weighted average price of the Ahlstrom-Munksjö share during the period of
January-February of the calendar year immediately following the last year of the performance period.

**_Rewards granted and the fair value of reward_**

The fair value of the reward at the grant date was EUR 2.1 million. The fair value is calculated based on the
probability of achieving each individual TSR threshold at the end of the performance period between the
minimum and maximum thresholds set by the Group and estimated rate of realization of EBITDA criteria.

The following inputs have been used in the fair valuation model to determine the fair value:

**_Expenses arising from LTI 2017-19 share-based payment transactions_**

The share-based expense relating to the period from the grant date (December 22, 2017) to the balance sheet
date was EUR 1.1 million.

**Bridge plan**

In addition to the long-term share-based incentive plan, the Board of Directors decided to establish a bridge
plan to cover the gap in the former LTI structure, which results from the Ahlstrom-Munksjö merger and the
transition to the new plan as described above.

The bridge plan covers the most critical leadership resources of Ahlstrom-Munksjö and will be a one-off
plan. The bridge plan includes one performance period comprising years 2017-2018. The reward will be paid out
in spring 2019 in the form of shares, provided that certain performance and service conditions are met. The
payment of the reward is followed by a one-year restriction period.

Depending on which levels of the performance and service condition thresholds are met, the gross EUR
value of the reward paid will be within a minimum and maximum range, with the final number of shares being
determined based on Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s share price at the end of the performance period. The minimum gross
value of the reward has been fixed to EUR 0.2 million and the maximum gross value has been fixed to EUR
4.1 million, and the final reward EUR value will be converted into an equivalent number of shares based on the
trade volume weighted average price of the Ahlstrom-Munksjö share during the period of January-February of
the calendar year immediately following the last year of the performance period.

The performance conditions for the bridge plan are the same as those for the LTI plan. Both of the
performance conditions will need to be met over the 2017-2018 performance period in order for the rewards to
qualify for vesting.

**_Rewards granted and the fair value of rewards_**

The fair value of the rewards at the grant date was EUR 1.3 million. The fair value is calculated based on the
probability of achieving each individual TSR threshold at the end of the performance period between the
minimum and maximum thresholds set by the Group and estimated rate of realization of EBITDA criteria.

**_Expenses arising from Bridge plan_**

The share-based expense relating to the period from the grant date (December 22, 2017) to the balance sheet
date was EUR 0.8 million.

**Predecessor Munksjö LTI plans**

Munksjö had prior to the effective date of the merger, two separate long-term incentive plans in place, LTI
2014-2016 and LTI 2016-2018. Participants were awarded Matching and Performance Rights, based on an initial
investment of saving shares. Under the original terms and conditions, the Matching and Performance Rights
would have vested conditional on specific performance criteria, holding of investment shares and continued
employment of the participant. The vesting period for both programs was originally three year. The LTI 20142016 plan vested in accordance with the original terms and conditions of the plan and a total of 126,371 shares
were delivered to the participants on vesting. The total cost for the LTI recorded in 2017 comprised of
EUR 0.7 million of the equity-settled payment recorded against the Group equity and EUR 3,3 million of a cashsettled compensation cost representing the cash portion to the participants to cover the tax portion and social
security costs for the employees.

On December 16, 2016, the Board of Directors decided to terminate the Munksjö 2016-2018 LTI’s. The
2016-2018 LTI terminated on the completion of the merger, on 1 April 2017 on a pro rata basis, thereby
cancelling 7/12 of the program (the original award period would have terminated at the end of 2018 and the
award would have been payable in the spring of 2019). The participants in the program received shares and cash.
The termination was accounted for as a cancellation. A total of 108,767 shares in Ahlstrom-Munksjö were
transferred to the participants during April 2017 equaling to a compensation expense on the equity-settled portion
of EUR 2.1 million and a cash payment of EUR 0.7 million was made to compensate the employee tax
implications and social security costs.

The total cost recognized in the 2016 income statement for LTI 2014-2016 amounted to EUR 2.9 million
and at December 31, 2016, the cash settled liability amounted to EUR 2.2 million and the amount recognized in
equity amounted to EUR 0.7 million.

**Accounting policies**

**Share-based payments**

The LTI 2017-2019 and the bridge plan are accounted for as share-based payments whereby employees in
exchange for providing services receive Ahlstrom-Munksjö shares. Ahlstrom-Munksjö has classified these
programs as equity-settled as it is the Group’s intention to settle the rewards in the form of shares. AhlstromMunksjö has granted the participants with the right to receive a variable number of shares which will ultimately
depend on the achievement of the performance conditions.

Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s share-based payments include both market and non-market performance conditions.
The Group calculates the grant-date fair value using a probability weighted value model to reflect the probability
of not achieving the TSR (market) conditions and estimated rate of realization of EBITDA criteria (non-market
condition). Both performance conditions are taken into account when determining the grant date fair value and
accordingly, the expense is recognized irrespectively of whether the conditions are satisfied. The requirement to
stay in service is not factored into the grant date fair value. If the service condition is not met, the cumulative
share-based payment cost will be trued-up accordingly.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**7 EMPLOYEE AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS REMUNERATION (Continued)**

The share-based cost related to equity-settled schemes is recognized by the Group under Employee benefit
expenses in the income statement. The total cost is determined by reference to the fair value at grant-date and is
recognized over the expected vesting period. At each balance sheet date, Ahlstrom-Munksjö revises the
cumulative share-based cost expected to be paid out based on the estimated retention rate of participants at the
end of the performance period.

The rewards will be settled by the Group, net of taxes that will be withheld. From January 1, 2018 onwards,
new guidance has been introduced that enables net settled schemes to be treated as equity settled.

**Accounting estimates and judgements**

The LTI and bridge plan have been accounted for as equity settled share-based payments. This is based on a
judgment made by the Group that the plans will be rewarded in the form of shares and not settled in cash.

The fair value of the rewards granted in the LTI and bridge plan have been estimated at the grant-date based
on the probability of TSR reaching specific thresholds at the end of the performance period and estimated rate of
realization of EBITDA criteria. In order to calculate the probabilities, the most important assumptions that have
been made in the probability weighted value model comprise of required rate of return of 8.0% and annual TSR
volatility of 33.2%. The estimated rate of realization of EBITDA criteria is based on management’s estimates of
the probability of achieving the comparable EBITDA performance criteria. In order to estimate the likelihood of
achieving the comparable EBITDA criteria management consider the Group’s comparable EBITDA performance
against the forecast for the vesting period.

The expense recognized in Employee benefit expenses is based on management’s estimates of the estimated
number of participants remaining in the scheme when the vesting period ends.

At the end of each period, management estimates the expected retention rate for participants to calculate the
expense for the current period and the change in the amount recognized in equity in relation to the share-based
payments.

Management estimate the number of participants that they expect to remain in the scheme at the end of the
vesting period by reviewing the number of participants remaining at the end of each period, and the expected
number of these participants who will remain at the pay-out date, considering the historic rate of staff retention in
the Group.

**Impairment losses**

Impairment losses relate to restructuring of one-side coated product segment, a part of the Specialties
business area, where the markets have significant overcapacity globally and the Group’s offering is not optimally
aligned with the strategy of niche orientation in customized solutions. The operating environment has further
deteriorated mainly due to increased raw material costs. The Group contemplates a plan to optimize its
production capacity and product offering to meet the profitable demand and investigates the closure of one paper
machine (PM1) in Stenay, France.

**Accounting policies**

Depreciation and amortization is recognized in the income statement on a straight-line basis based on
estimated useful life of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, adjusted in appropriate cases by
impairments. The useful lives are estimated as the period over which the Group will derive a benefit from the
asset.

Goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are considered as non-depreciable assets.
For non-depreciable assets, impairment tests are performed annually, as well as if there are any indications of
impairments during the year, by calculating the assets recovery value. For more information on the impairment of
goodwill and other intangible assets see note 12.

**Accounting policies**

**Current and deferred tax expense**

The income tax expense is comprised of current tax and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income
statement except when underlying transactions are reported in other comprehensive income, or directly in equity,
in which case the associated tax effect is reported in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

Current taxes are based on the results of group companies and are calculated using the local tax laws and tax
rates that are enacted or substantively enacted as of each reporting date. Adjustments in respect of prior year or
uncertain tax treatments are recorded based on the probable outcome.

Deferred tax is calculated using the liability method on temporary differences between the carrying amounts
and taxable values of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is not recognised for temporary differences that arise on
initial recognition of goodwill or the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction other than a
business combination that do not affect either the accounting or taxable profit at the time of the transaction.

Deferred tax is not recognized for temporary differences that arise on investments in subsidiaries where the
reversal is in the Group’s control and not expected in the foreseeable future.

The valuation of deferred tax provided is based on how carrying amounts of assets or liabilities are expected
to be realized or settled. Deferred tax is calculated by applying the tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at
the reporting date.

Deferred tax assets for tax-deductible temporary differences and loss carry forwards are recognized only to
the extent it is likely that they will be utilized.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**10 TAXES (Continued)**

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legal right to offset current tax assets and
liabilities, and when the deferred tax assets and tax liabilities are attributable to taxes charged by the same tax
authority and relate to either the same tax entities or different tax entities, where there is an intention to settle the
balances on a net basis.

**Accounting estimates and judgements**

The utilization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and generation of
future taxable profits. The Group periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in
which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It makes a revaluation of the amounts recorded, where
appropriate, on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

**11 EARNINGS PER SHARE**

In December 2018, in connection with the share issue, 19,214,742 new shares were issued. In April 2017, in
connection with the merger of Ahlstrom and Munksjö, 45,376,992 new shares were issued as merger
consideration to Ahlstrom’s shareholders. The total number of shares a the end of December 2018 is
115,653,315. The comparative period presented, doesn’t represent a like-for-like comparative.

**Goodwill**

**2018**

The carrying value of goodwill amounted to EUR 630.6 million as of December 31, 2018. The goodwill of
EUR 201.9 million arising from the acquisition of Expera Specialty Solutions and MD Papéis’ Caieiras during
2018 is attributable to workforce, synergies and expanding the platform for future growth. Acquired goodwill
from Expera Specialty Solutions has been allocated to North America Specialty Solutions business area and
goodwill from MD Papéis’ Caieiras to Decor and Industrial Solutions business areas. The carrying value of
goodwill amounted to EUR 429.4 million as of December 31, 2017 following the merger of Munksjö and
Ahlstrom. The goodwill of EUR 213.7 million recorded in 2017 from the merger represents the value of acquired
workforce and synergies.

Ahlstrom-Munksjö is organized into five business areas which are Decor, Filtration and Performance,
Industrial Solutions, North America Specialty Solutions and Specialties. North America Specialty Solutions
business area includes the operations and business of Expera Specialty Solutions. Business of Caieiras has been
divided into two segments: Decor and Industrial Solutions. These five business areas are the Group’s reportable
segments. Goodwill was allocated to the new business areas reflecting their share of the deemed fair values of the
acquired assembled workforce, expected synergies and other benefits. These five business areas correspond to
the groups of cash-generating units (CGU) and the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal
management purposes. See note 3 for more information about the acquisitions of Expera Specialty Solutions and
MD Papéis’ Caieiras and merger of Ahlstrom and Munksjö, and note 4 for business area information.

The following table presents the allocation of goodwill to Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s business areas (groups of
CGUs) as of the annual impairment testing date:

**Impairment tests for goodwill**

The recoverable amounts of each group of cash-generating units are determined using a discounted cash
flow model (value-in-use). Key assumptions used in the determination include short-term and long-term growth
rate for net sales, development of EBITDA, annual capital expenditure, changes in operative working capital and
pre-tax discount rate.

The cash flows are based on business plans approved by the Board of Directors covering a period of three
years. Cash flows beyond this three-year period are based on the terminal value and have been extrapolated using
an estimated long-term sales growth rate of 1.5% considering inflation. All cash flow projections reflect the past
performance of the Group’s business operations and management expectations for future market development
considering the external sources of information when available.

The discount rate used in the calculation is based on weighted average cost of capital (WACC) based on the
market view of the time-value of money and reflect specific risks related to each business area.

The impairment tests for 2018 indicated that the recoverable amount of the groups of CGUs exceeded their
carrying value and goodwill is not been impaired.

Goodwill impairment tests for 2017 were carried out for Ahlstrom-Munksjö group’s segments at
December 31, 2017: Decor, Filtration and Performance, Industrial solutions and Specialties. The impairment
tests did not result in a recognition of any impairment.

**Sensitivity analysis**

As a part of the performance reviews, management has performed sensitivity analysis regarding the key
assumptions. The parameters used in the impairment tests, which were the most sensitive for changes were
EBITDA margin and pre-tax discount rate. The table below shows the percentage change in the key parameters
used in the calculations that would result in the value in use being equal to the carrying value (keeping other
parameters constant). The recoverable amount of the assets tested in 2018 exceeds their carrying value by
EUR 288 million for Decor, EUR 956 million for Filtration and Performance, EUR 482 million for Industrial
Solutions, EUR 209 million for North America Specialty Solutions and EUR 541 million for Specialties.

Management has considered and assessed reasonable possible changes for other key assumptions and has
not identified any instances that would result in a carrying amount that exceed the recoverable amount of the
groups of CGUs.

**Research and development**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö has product and process development activities focusing mainly on meeting customer
requirements in relation to product properties and adaptations. Research and development costs are expensed
except those development expenses that meet the capitalization criteria. Development costs that met
capitalization criteria and were capitalized amounted to EUR 3.6 million in December 31, 2018.

**Emission rights**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö participates in the European Union emission trading scheme in which it has received
free emission allowances for a defined period. Ahlstrom-Munksjö was granted 418,206 units of CO[2] emission

F-188

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**12 INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (Continued)**

rights for the year 2018. The rights in excess of the Group’s needs have been transferred to 2019. As of
December 31, 2018, the remaining CO[2] credits amounted to 245,324 units and their market value was
approximately EUR 5,5 million.

In 2018, Ahlstrom-Munksjö has sold emission rights for EUR 2.7 million and bought emission rights for
EUR 0.8 million. In 2017, there were no transactions relating to emission rights purchases or sales.

**Accounting policies**

**Intangible assets**

**_Goodwill_**

Goodwill arises from business combinations and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over
the Group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired at the acquisition date. Goodwill is an
intangible asset with an indefinite useful life. It is not amortized, but it is subject to impairment testing annually,
or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired.

For impairment testing purposes, goodwill is allocated to groups of cash-generating units reflecting the
lowest levels at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. A cash-generating unit, as
determined for the purposes of the impairment testing, is the smallest group of assets generating separately
identifiable cash inflows, which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets
(cash-generating units). The carrying value of a cash generated unit includes its share of relevant corporate assets
allocated to it on a reasonable and consistent basis.

Ahlstrom-Munksjö conducts its impairment testing by determining the recoverable amount for a group of
CGUs. The recoverable amount is defined as value-in-use according to a present value of the estimated future
cash flows. The recoverable amount is compared to the group of CGUs’ carrying value. If the carrying value
exceeds the recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
If an impairment loss is recognized, the loss is first allocated to reduce goodwill and then to reduce other assets.

Impairment is recognized as an expense in the income statement. An impairment loss recognized for
goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.

**_Other intangible assets_**

Customer relationships, patents and trademarks, technology related assets and other intangible assets
acquired in business combinations are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date and are subsequently
amortized on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives.

Computer software and separately acquired patents and trademarks are recorded at historical cost and
amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives.

Other intangible assets with definite useful lives are tested for impairment if there are indicators of
impairment, see more information on triggering events in Accounting policy of Property, plant and equipment
below.

**_Research and development_**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö has product and process development activities focusing mainly on meeting customer
requirements in relation to product properties and adaptations. Activities are divided into a research phase and a
development phase. Research costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in the income statement. Expenditures
on development activities are also expensed as incurred except those development expenses that meet the
capitalization criteria. Development costs arising from the development of new or significantly improved
products are capitalized as intangible assets when the costs of the development stage can be reliably determined,
the product is technically feasible and economically viable, the product is expected to produce economic benefits
and the Group has the intention and the required resources to complete the development effort. Capitalized
development costs include the costs of material, labor and testing that are directly attributable to creating,
producing and preparing the asset to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
Amortization period for capitalized development costs is 10 years.

**_Emission rights_**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö participates in the European Union’s Emissions Trading Scheme aimed at reducing
greenhouse gas emission and receives allowances for a defined period to emit a fixed tonnage carbon dioxide.
The Group receives allowances either free of charge from the scheme or acquires them from other participants.
The allowances received and the liability based on the actual emissions are netted. A provision is recognized if
the allowances received do not cover the actual emissions. No intangible asset is recognized for the excess of
allowances received free of charge. Gains arising from the sale of the emission right allowances are recorded in
energy costs in the income statement.

**Accounting estimates and judgements**

**Key assumptions used in goodwill impairment testing**

The management makes significant estimates and judgements in determining the level at which the goodwill
is tested and whether there are any indications of impairment.

The calculations of the value-in-use are based on cash flow projections, which require assessments and
estimates from the management. The most significant estimates concern development of net sales and EBITDA
including estimates for market prices of pulp and cost levels of main raw materials and energy as well as
determination of the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) used to discount cash flows. Management tests
the impacts of changes in significant estimates used in forecasts by sensitivity analyses as described in this note.

**_Impairment of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets_**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö assesses the recoverability of the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and
intangible assets with definite useful lives if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
may be impaired (a triggering event). Factors that the Group considers when it reviews indicators of impairment
include, but are not limited to:

   - Observable indications for decrease in value

   - Significant adverse changes that have taken place in the technological, market, economic or legal
environment

   - Increases in interest rates

   - Obsolescence or physical damage affecting the asset

   - Deterioration in the expected level of the asset’s performance or adverse changes impacting the way
the asset is used or expected to be used

   - Where management’s own forecasts of future net cash inflows or operating profits show a significant
decline from previous budgets and forecasts

The carrying amount of an asset is written down immediately to the asset’s recoverable amount if the
carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is determined as the higher of an asset’s
fair value less costs to sell or its value-in-use. Value-in-use is determined by discounting future cash flows
expected to be generated by the asset. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest
level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating unit).

The impairment of assets is reversed if there is an indication that it is no longer necessary, and there has
been a change in the assumptions which formed the basis of the calculation of the recoverable amount. A reversal
is only made to the extent that the asset’s carrying value after reversal does not exceed the carrying value that the
asset would have had, with a deduction for depreciation, if no impairment had been carried out.

**12 INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (Continued)**

**_Property, plant and equipment_**

Land and land improvements include the Group’s freehold land and the landfills that the Group operates at
or near certain of its facilities in the United States. The operation of these landfills require state, federal and local
permits for construction, operation and closure and the landfills are subject to constructing final capping and
continued monitoring.

The freehold land and land improvements are recognized at cost. The cost of land improvements include the
cost of landfill preparation and excavation, construction of liners, related costs for environmental permits and
studies and the initial estimate to close, cap and care the landfill, for which the Group has made the
environmental provision (see note 16).

Property, plant and equipment are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment.
The cost includes the purchase price and expenditure directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and
condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended. Interest on borrowings directly
attributable to the purchase, construction or production of assets that take considerable time to complete are
capitalized.

Property, plant and equipment comprising parts with different useful lives are treated as separate
components of the asset. The costs incurred for replacing the part are recognized in the carrying amount of the
asset which is depreciated over the useful life of replacement. The carrying value of a property, plant and
equipment is derecognized from the balance sheet on scrapping or sale, or when no future economic benefits are
expected from use of the asset. Ordinary repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

Gains and losses arising from the sale of property, plant and equipment are recognized as other operating
income or other operating expenses.

**_Government grants_**

Government grants are recognized at fair value when there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be
received. Government grants relating to the purchase of property, plant and equipment are deducted from the cost
of the assets and accordingly reduce the depreciation of the underlying asset. Other government grants are
recognized in the income statement in the same period than the costs they are intended to compensate on a net
basis unless the grant compensates an item which has been expensed in prior years.

**_Finance lease agreements_**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö leases certain property, plant and equipment. Leasing agreements of property, plant and
equipment where the Group retains the economic risks and benefits associated with ownership, are classified as
financial leases. At the start of the leasing period, financial leases are reported in the balance sheet at the lower of
the leased asset’s fair value and the net present value of the minimum lease payments. Each leasing payment is
apportioned between the repayment of liability and financial costs. The corresponding payment obligations, after
deductions for financial costs, are included in the balance sheet, in non-current and current borrowings. The
interest is recognized in the income statement over the lease term so that each accounting period is assigned an
amount corresponding to a fixed interest rate for the liability in the respective period. Financial leased fixed
assets are depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and lease term.

**Accounting estimates and judgements**

**Estimates and judgements related to property, plant and equipment as well as other intangible assets**

The Group has tangible and other intangible assets with definite useful lives which values are presented
above. The assets are tested for impairment when there are events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value may be impaired (a triggering event). The recoverability of these assets is based on market
assumptions and managements estimate of future cash flows. Changes in assumptions and failure to meet certain
earnings targets could result in impairment.

**Accounting policies**

Inventories are recognized at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is calculated as
the selling price less costs attributable to the sale.

The methodology for determining the cost of inventories varies depending on the inventory class.

**Materials and supplies**

Materials and supplies are valued using the weighted average cost method. Under the weighted average cost
method, the cost of each items remaining in inventories at the period end is determined from the weighted
average of the cost of similar items at the beginning of the period and the cost of similar items purchased during
the period.

**Finished products and Work in progress**

Finished products and work in progress are valued on a first-in, first-out basis. Costs comprise all costs that
are directly attributable to the manufacturing process, including direct material and labour, and production related
overheads (based on normal operating capacity and normal consumption of material, labour and other production
costs) and depreciation charges.

**Accounting estimates and judgements**

**Inventory obsolescence**

If the net realizable value of inventory is deemed lower than the cost, then allowance is established for
inventory obsolescence. The amount to be allocated to inventory obsolescence is based on an estimation of the
net realizable value of inventory.

**14 TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES AND TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES**

Trade and other receivables represent amounts that Ahlstrom–Munksjö expects to collect from other parties.
Trade and other payables mainly consist of amounts owed to suppliers, employees and customers.

Trade receivables consists mainly of receivables from contracts with customers. The increase of contract
liabilities is due to the acquisitions of Expera Specialty Solutions and MD Papéis’ Caieiras.

**Ageing of trade receivable**

The Group applies the simplified approach to assess the credit risk of trade receivables. The loss allowance
is measured at the estimate of the lifetime expected credit losses. The Group uses a bad debt provision matrix to
determine the expected credit loss rates. It considers historical loss rates for each ageing category and region. The
calculated loss percentage is then adjusted with the forward looking macroeconomic data. For trade receivables
not due or maximum 180 days overdue, an impairment of 0.0% -10.0% is made. The trade receivables, which are
overdue 181-360 days will be impared with 60% and more than 360 days old will be impaired with 100%. The
trade receivables are partly insured and the amount that will be received from the insurer is excluded from the
calculation of the trade receivables impairment.

In the prior years, the impairment of trade receivables was assessed based on the incurred loss model.
Individual receivables which were known to be uncollectible were written off by reducing the carrying amount
directly. The other receivables were assessed collectively to determine whether there was objective evidence that
an impairment had been incurred but not yet been identified. For these receivables the estimated impairment
losses were recognised in a separate provision for impairment.

The ageing of trade receivable, both gross and the impaired amount, is shown in the following table.

**Accounting policies**

**Trade and other receivables**

Trade and other receivables are recognized at amortized cost, using the effective interest rate method, less
any impairment losses, with the exception of fair value of unrealized hedges whose treatment is discussed in
note 19. The credit quality of receivables that are neither past due nor impaired has been deemed sufficient and
payments are expected to be received when the receivables are due. Any changes to the allowance for doubtful
accounts receivable are recognized as an expense in the income statement.

**Trade and other payables**

Trade and other payables represent liabilities for goods and services and are recognized at amortized cost,
using the effective interest rate method. The amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days from
initial recognition.

**15 DEFINED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS**

The Group has defined benefit plans in several countries, of which the most significant are the United States
44% of Group’s total defined benefit pension liability, United Kingdom 24%, France 11%, Germany 7% and
Sweden 6%. The plans are in accordance with local laws and practices and are funded to satisfy the local
statutory funding requirements.

Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s most significant funded defined benefit plans are in the United States and the United
Kingdom. The assets are managed by external fund managers. The funds are allocated between equities and fixed
income instruments in order to provide return at target level and limited risk profile. The valuations of the
obligations are carried out by independent qualified actuaries.

In the United States, a part of Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s employees are members Group Retirement Plan for U.S.
Employees, which is a funded defined benefit plan and the largest of the Group’s schemes in the United States.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**15 DEFINED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS (Continued)**

The plan is managed by Ahlstrom-Munksjo USA Inc.’s Pension Committee. The scheme has been closed to new
members since 2006. In addition to the Group Retirement Plan for U.S. Employees, Ahlstrom-Munksjö also
operates a number of other post-employment benefit plans in the United States, including providing
post-employment medical and life insurance benefits, retirement plans for hourly paid employees, and State
Earnings Related Pension Schemes (SERPS). These plans are predominantly unfunded.

In the United Kingdom, the Group operates a funded defined benefit plan. The pension plan is designed
according to the Definitive Trust Deed and Rules and complies with the guidelines of the UK Pension Regulator.
The pension scheme has been closed to new members since 2006 and is managed through Ahlstrom-Munksjö
Chirnside Ltd.

In France the main funded defined benefit plans operated by the group is the termination indemnity plan.
Termination indemnity plans are designed to finance the severances paid to the employees who leave the
company for retirement. Ahlstrom-Munksjö still operates other post-employment benefit plans in France which
are closed to new members for many years.

The Group’s main unfunded defined benefit plans are in Germany, Italy (TFR Trattamento di Fine
Rapporto, termination indemnity plan) and in Sweden. The pension schemes in Germany and Italy are closed for
new entrants. In Sweden, the pension cover is organized through unfunded defined benefit plans (ITP system,
Industrins och handels tilläggspension).

**Risks associated with defined benefit plans**

Through its defined benefit pension plans the Group is exposed to a number of risks.

**Changes in bond yields**

The employer’s defined benefit obligations pension liability are calculated using a discount rate which is
determined with reference to corporate bond yield as at the balance sheet date. A decrease (increase) in used
discount rates increase (decrease) the defined benefits obligations. However, a decrease (increase) in the used
discount rate yield also increases (decreases) the fair value of the assets partially offsetting the total impact of the
change in yield on the net defined benefit pension liability.

**Inflation risk**

The benefit of the plans is tied to the future pension increase, which depends on inflation and common
salary index. Higher inflation increases the benefit increase, which leads to an increase in liabilities and annual
payments to the insurance company.

If the active employee’s salary increases more than the common salary index, the amount of promised
benefit and the benefit obligation increases together with annual payments to life insurance company.

**Life expectancy**

Longevity risk arises in case the actual timing of mortality differs from the assumed. Possible adjustments in
mortality assumption have an effect on the employer’s liability.

Sensitivities are calculated by changing one assumption while keeping other variables constant.

**Accounting policies**

**Defined benefit obligation**

The Group has various pension schemes in accordance with local practices in different countries. The
pension arrangements are classified as either defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans. The schemes are
mostly funded through payments to insurance companies or trustee-administered funds according to local
regulations. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group and usually also the employees
pay fixed contributions to an insurance company. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay
further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay the pension benefits to the employees.
Contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognized as expense in the period when they incur. All
pension plans which do not meet the criteria for defined contribution plans are defined benefit plans. Defined
benefit plans typically define a fixed amount of benefit that an employee will receive after retirement and which
the Group is responsible for.

The Group’s net obligation of defined benefit plans is calculated and recorded separately for each pension
scheme based on calculations prepared by independent actuaries. The present value of defined benefit obligations
is determined using the projected unit credit method. The net liability recognized in the balance sheet is the
present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of the plan
assets. The discount rate used to determine the present value of the defined benefit obligation is equal to the yield
on high quality corporate bonds or, if not available, government bonds.

The interest rates of the high quality corporate bonds are determined in the currency in which the benefits
will be paid with a similar maturity to the obligation.

The Group’s net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits, other than pension benefits, is the
amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.

**Accounting estimates and judgements**

Pension calculations under defined benefit plans include several factors that rely on management estimates:
the discount rate used in calculating pension expenses and obligations for the period, the rate of salary increase
and the rate of future discretionary bonuses decided by the insurance company. Changes in these assumptions can
significantly impact the amounts of pension liability and future pension expenses.

Environmental provisions of EUR 18.8 million mainly relate to landfill related provisions in the U.S.
EUR 8.9 million and future restoration costs of old Fitchburg mill in the U.S., and old buildings in Sweden.

On October 30, 2018 Ahlstrom-Munksjö announced it plans to significantly improve the competitiveness of
its one-side coated paper segment, a part of the Specialties business area. The Group plans to optimize its
production capacity and product offering to meet the profitable demand and investigates the closure of one paper
machine (PM1) in Stenay, France. Employee consultation processes started on October 30, 2018. A restructuring
provision recognized for this at year end was EUR 11.2 million and is reported in the restructuring provisions.
Other restructuring provisions and other provisions mainly consist of severance costs and legal claims.

**Accounting policies**

A provision is recognized when a present legal or constructive obligation exists as a result of a past event
and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be
reliably estimated. Provisions are split between amounts expected to be settled within 12 months on the balance
sheet (current) and amounts expected to be settled later (non-current).

**Restructuring**

A provision for restructuring is only recognized when a formal plan has been approved and the
implementation of the plan has either commenced or the plan has been announced.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**16 PROVISIONS (Continued)**

**Environmental**

Environmental provisions are recorded based on current interpretations of environmental laws and
regulations. Such provisions are recognized when it is probable that an obligation has arisen and that the amount
of the obligation can be reliably measured. The amount recognized is the present value of the estimated future
expenditure determined in accordance with local conditions and requirements.

**Accounting estimates and judgements**

**Environmental**

The estimates used in determining the provisions for environmental costs are based on management’s
expectations of, for example:

   - Timing and scope

   - Future cost levels

   - Laws and regulations enacted at time of the restoration works

The timing of the environmental costs depends on the expected useful lives of the Group’s sites. These
range from 50 – 70 years. In measuring the future cost levels, the Group estimates future costs and adjusts these
for the effect of inflation, cost-base development and discounting. The estimated costs are based on current laws
and regulations in place at the time of making the provision.

The Group utilizes a third party consultant to estimate both the closure and long-term care costs for the
landfills. The estimate is based on the area finally to be capped and the capping materials and activities required
along with the permit and regulatory requirements for closure and post-closure maintenance. These costs are
reviewed periodically by the Group’s environmental experts and by a third party consultant.

Because actual outflows can differ from estimates due to changes in law, regulations, public expectations,
technology, prices and conditions, and can take place many years in the future, the carrying amounts of
provisions are regularly reviewed and adjusted to take into account any such changes. The discount rate used is
reviewed annually.

##### Net debt and capital management

This section outlines the Group’s net debt and how Ahlstrom-Munksjö manages its capital including
liquidity management. The Group’s objective when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to
continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other
stakeholders, and maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

In order to maintain or adjust the Group’s capital structure, the Group uses different means such as adjust
the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, issue new shares, refinance its debt or sell assets to reduce debt.
Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s monitors capital based on the gearing ratio with a target below 100%. At the end of 2018
the ratio was 83.6% (36.2%).

**17 NET DEBT**

Net debt is Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s key measure to evaluate the total external debt financing of the Group. Net
debt is defined as borrowings less cash and cash equivalents and the securitization liability. The Group’s sources
of borrowing for funding and liquidity purposes are primarily bank loans and bonds. The Group has also entered
into a number of finance leases to secure the availability of assets used in the production process.

**Borrowings**

In 2016 the Group entered into a facilities agreement consisting of several facilities (A-E and revolving
facility) consisting of app. EUR 560 million multicurrency term and revolving credit facilities with maturities
ranging between three and five years and a EUR 200 million bridge facility later reduced to EUR 100 million.
Following the merger of Ahlstrom and Munksjö in 2017, new financing was arranged for the combined
company, consisting of multicurrency term facilities and a revolving credit facility, as well as a bridge facility.
Outstanding term facilities under this agreement and the revolving facility terminate on April 1, 2022.

On May 3, 2017, Ahlstrom-Munksjö redeemed the EUR 100 million hybrid bond with a fixed annual
interest rate of 7.875% in accordance with its terms and conditions. The redemption value was EUR 106.9
million. In addition, Ahlstrom-Munksjö made a voluntary tender offer for cash of its EUR 100 million 4.125%
notes originally maturing in September 2019. The aggregate principal amount of notes validly offered for
purchase by noteholders was EUR 89.2 million. On September 15, 2017, Ahlstrom-Munksjö Oyj exercised its
right to fully redeem the outstanding 2019 notes. On June 9, 2017, the company issued a EUR 250 million
unsecured callable bond with an annual coupon of 1.875%. The notes are callable before maturity and shall be
repaid in full at their nominal principal amount on June 9, 2022. The proceeds from the issue were used to repay
and refinance the 2019 bond and certain other borrowings of the company.

To finance the Expera acquisition that took place on October 10, 2018 (see note 3), the company withdrew a
EUR 155.2 million bridge-to-equity facility and a EUR 167.0 bridge-to-loan facility under the Bridge Facilities

Agreement, and a USD 260.0 million facility (“Facility B”) and a EUR 108.0 million facility (“Facility A”)
under the Term Facilities Agreement. The latter one was used to prepay the outstanding loans under the existing
Facility C under the Facilities Agreement and the facility C was cancelled in full. On November 1, 2018 the
Group entered into a EUR 200.0 million term facility agreement with Nordea and SEB as lenders which was used
to repay the EUR 167.0 bridge-facility under the Bridge Facilities Agreement and the revolving loan of
EUR 40.0 million withdrawn under the facilities agreement complemented with a cash payment. Facility A will
be repaid in semi-annual instalments of EUR 5 million starting on May 31, 2019 and the Facility B will be repaid
in at maturity, which is October 10, 2023 for both. The bridge-to-equity was repaid on December 27, 2018 using
the proceeds from the rights issue (see note 18).

In addition, Ahlstrom-Munksjö assumed in the Expera acquisition a securitization liability presented within
current borrowings in the balance sheet. The financing received under this arrangement amounts to
EUR 43.7 million as at December 31, 2018.

To finance the Caieiras acquisition, the Group withdrew a BRL 330.0 million loan (see note 3). The loan
will mature in 2023.

At the balance sheet date, the weighted average interest rate for the Group was approximately 3.3% (2.2%).
Net debt amounted to EUR 971.3 million (EUR 375.3 million) at December 31, 2018, resulting in a gearing of
83.6% (36.2%). According to Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s current financial covenants 2018, the consolidated net debt to
consolidated EBITDA needs to be 3.5 or less and the consolidated senior net debt to adjusted equity shall not
exceed 100%. Throughout the reporting period the Group was in full compliance with the covenants of its
financing agreements and management expects such compliance to continue.

The tables below provide further detail on the financing entered in to by the Group.

**Interest rate risk**

Interest rate risk refers to the risk that changes in interest rates would have a negative effect on the result of
the Group and could affect the long-term competitiveness of Ahlstrom-Munksjö. There is a risk of interest rates
moving both upwards and downwards. However, in accordance with the loan terms, the reference rates in the
Group’s bank loans have a floor at zero. Accordingly, as long as the reference rates are below zero, the Group’s
interest payments correspond to the margin.

All bank loans of the Group are at variable interest rates, which is in essence fixed when the reference
interest rate is below zero due to the floor in the bank loans. The bond is a fixed rate borrowing. The average
maturity of the total debt portfolio is currently 10 months (22 months).

Consideration is taken at all times to assess how vulnerable the Group is to a change in interest rates. In
order to limit the impact of movements in interest rates, the Treasury Policy provides the following guidelines:

   - Aim is to achieve an average maturity of the interest rates in the debt portfolio, including the interest
rate derivatives, of 2 years +/-1 year or in accordance with the loan agreement if so specified.

   - Interest maturities are preferably spread out evenly over time in order to avoid substantial risk
concentrated on single financial year.

More information on how Ahlstrom-Munksjö manages its financial risks is presented below in note 19.

amounts held in the bank accounts in order to improve liquidity management. Group Treasury is responsible for
the Group’s cash pool management.

Bank deposits earn variable interest based on the bank’s daily deposit rate.

Restricted cash amounting to EUR 0.7 million (EUR 1.5 million) is presented in current trade and other
receivables.

**Accounting policies**

**Borrowings**

Bonds, bank loans and loans from multilateral institutions are recognized at their inception at their fair value
(typically the proceeds received) net of directly related transaction costs incurred. The borrowings are
subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Transaction costs are amortized
over the life of the borrowings based on the effective interest method.

**Facility fees**

Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognized as transaction costs of the credit facilities
and facility loans to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case,
the fee is deferred until the draw down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or
all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalized as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortized
over the period of the facility to which it relates.

**Derecognition of borrowings**

Borrowings are removed from the balance sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged,
cancelled or expired. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability that has been
extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred
or liabilities assumed, is recognised in profit or loss within financial items.

**Finance leases**

Leases are treated as a finance lease when the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are substantially
transferred to Ahlstrom-Munksjö by a lease contract. The Group recognizes the leased asset and related
obligation in the balance sheet at the lower of the leased asset’s fair value or the present value of minimum lease
payments. Minimum lease payments made under the finance lease over the lease term are apportioned between
finance cost and the reductions of the outstanding liability. The finance cost is allocated to each year during the
lease term so as to produce a constant period rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. The lease
asset is depreciated over the lease term, unless the ownership is transferred to the Group at the end of the lease,
when they are depreciated in accordance with Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s policy for property, plant and equipment
which are defined in note 8.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, deposits held at call with financial institutions, other
short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible
to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Bank overdrafts, as
applicable, are shown within borrowings in current liabilities in the balance sheet.

**18 EQUITY**

The Board of the Directors of Ahlstrom-Munksjö together with the management of the Group considers
appropriate financial targets for Ahlstrom-Munksjö and agrees on a financial target framework. According to the

**19 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT**

**General**

Financial risks of the Group consist of credit risk (see note 14), funding risk, liquidity risk and market risks.
Market risks are further divided to currency risk, interest rate risk (refer to note 17) and commodity price risk.

Ahlstrom-Munksjö has updated its Treasury Policy during the year. The Treasury Policy sets the Board of
Directors’ guidelines on how finance and treasury operations are carried out and how financial risks within the
Group are managed. The guidelines aim to ensure that the Group’s financial risks are kept at an acceptable level.

The Treasury Policy is approved by the Board of Ahlstrom-Munksjö. The Board has the overall
responsibility for managing financial risks. Executive Treasury Committee monitors and manages the financial
risks. Operational management of financial risks is carried out centrally by the Group Treasury under the
Treasury Policy. Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the
Group’s operating units.

Group Treasury is handling all hedging of foreign exchange, commodity and interest rates, if nothing else
has been approved. Where all relevant criteria are met, hedge accounting is applied to remove the accounting
mismatch between the hedging instrument and the hedged item.

**Currency risk**

Due to the global operations of Ahlstrom-Munksjö, the Group is exposed to currency risk. Currency risk
refers to the risk that fluctuations in the foreign exchange market will negatively affect the Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s
cash flow, net profit and equity. Currency exposure, defined as all unhedged exposure in foreign currency, is split
into two types of exposure: transaction exposure and translation exposure.

**Transaction exposure**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö conducts manufacturing and sells its products around the globe and is therefore exposed
to transaction risk. Transaction exposure arises from commercial and finance-related transactions and payments
in a currency other than an operation’s functional currency i.e. from internal purchases, sales between
manufacturing units and market companies, external sales and purchases as well as from financing transactions in
foreign currencies.

Also firm commitments to acquire businesses may expose the Group to foreign currency transaction risk.
The Group hedged a portion (USD 300 million nominal) of the USD denominated firm commitment to acquire
Expera in latter part of 2018 by using a foreign exchange forward contract. The gain on hedge amounted to
EUR 4.4 million which was recorded as an adjustment to the purchase consideration (see note 3 for further
information on the acquisition of Expera).

Foreign currency cash flows are hedged on a net exposure basis in accordance with the rules set out in the
Treasury Policy. The Group’s risk management strategy in terms of currency risk and the guideline for Group
companies is to hedge 75% (+/-10%) of the forecasted cash flows for a period up to 9 months if the total
exposure to forecasted net flows of foreign currency exceeds the equivalent of 2% of total turnover of a Group
company. The Group uses forward contracts to hedge this commercial foreign currency exposure and applies
cash flow hedge accounting. The forward contracts’ maturity is materially reconciled with the timing of the
forecasted sales and purchases. At December 31, 2018 the fair value of the forwards under hedge accounting was
EUR 0.2 million. In 2018, the Group booked gain of EUR 0.4 million to the cash flow hedge transferred to this
year’s result in OCI. The Group has not historically booked material ineffectiveness from the hedging
relationships, however, ineffectiveness might arise from timing differences.

In addition to using derivatives for hedging, Ahlstrom-Munksjö also employs practical actions in order to
reduce the currency risk. The number of currencies used in intercompany invoicing is minimized and where
possible, Group Treasury will match foreign exchange cash flows within the Group.

At the end of the reporting period, the hedge ratio for the forecasted cash flows for the next 9 months,
including indirect exposure embedded in pulp prices, was approximately 75% (80%) for USD and about 70% for
SEK (70%). The exposures in other currencies are limited and not hedged. Outstanding nominal amounts at the
end of the year for these forward contracts were USD 21 million and SEK 720 million.

**19 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (Continued)**

The following table shows the Group’s estimated sensitivity for the next 9 months to a currency rate of a
weaker EUR of 5%, including FX-hedges and indirect exposures. The table is based on information monitored by
the Board for currency risk management.

The parent company has provided short term financing to its foreign subsidiaries which have been hedged
by using forward contracts at December 31, 2018. Hedge accounting is not applied to these relationships. The
nominal amounts of the loans are USD 25 million, CNY 25 million and GBP 20 million which correspond to the
nominal amounts of the forward contracts, which in three months. These forward contracts are recognised at fair
value with changes in fair value through the exchange gains and losses within the financial items. The fair value
for the forwards was EUR -0,3 million at December 31, 2018.

**Translation risk**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s income statement and balance sheet are both exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations,
as these affect the translation of subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.

The Group aims to minimize currency risk related to translation exposure by aiming to balance assets and
liabilities of subsidiaries so that the foreign exchange risk is minimized in the consolidated balance sheet. Due to
the long-term nature of net investments, equity hedging is not normally performed by the Group.

The following table shows the Group’s translation exposure arising from net investments in foreign
subsidiaries in major currencies. The table includes also a USD denominated intercompany loan that is accounted
for as part of the net investment in a US subsidiary. Settlement of the loan is not planned or likely to occur in the
foreseeable future.

**Accounting policies**

**Derivative instruments and hedging activities**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö uses derivative instruments to manage certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign
currency rates and interest rates. These derivative financial instruments are recognized initially at fair value on
the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are
carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.

Hedge accounting is applicable when, at inception of the hedge, there is a formal designation and
documentation of the hedging relationship and other criteria for hedge accounting are met. At inception of the
hedge relationship, the Group documents the economic relationship between hedging instruments and hedged
items including whether changes in the cash flows of the hedging instruments are expected to offset changes in
the cash flows of hedged items. The Group documents its risk management strategy and objective for
undertaking its hedge transactions.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**19 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (Continued)**

The Group only applies cash flow hedge accounting, which is used to hedge exposure to variability in cash
flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a highly probable forecast transaction or an
unrecognised firm commitment. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument is
booked in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity. It is reclassified in profit or loss when the
hedged item affects the profit or loss, or in the initial cost of the hedged item when it relates to the hedge of a
firm commitment to acquire a non-financial item (for example, business combination). The Group does not
separate forward points in a hedge relationship.

When a hedging instrument expires, is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for
hedge accounting, any cumulative deferred gain or loss and deferred costs of hedging in equity at that time
remains in equity until the forecast transaction occurs, resulting in the recognition of a non-financial asset such as
inventory. When the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss and deferred
costs of hedging that were reported in equity are immediately reclassified to profit or loss. Subsequent changes in
the value of the hedging instrument after the hedging relationship is terminated are recorded in profit and loss.

**Commodity risk**

Commodity risk refers to the risk that changes in the cost of raw materials (pulp, titanium dioxide) and
energy (electricity, gas, oil etc.) have a negative effect on the result and/or competitiveness of AhlstromMunksjö. Consideration as to the vulnerability of the Group to changes in relevant commodity prices is taken
periodically.

To mitigate the commodity risk exposure, the Group hedges commodity exposures in line with the Group
Treasury Policy. In accordance with the policy, commodity hedging should have a maximum length of 3 years
and can be up to 50% of forecasted consumption in the first year, 40% of forecasted consumption in the second
year and 30% in the third year. All hedging transaction are also to be connected to projects, customer agreements
or other direct identifiable business risks. This is in order to avoid speculative hedging. At the balance sheet date,
the Group did not have any outstanding commodity derivatives.

**Funding and liquidity risk**

**Funding risk**

Funding risk refers to the risk the Ahlstrom-Munksjö does not at all times have access to financing or
financing at an acceptable cost. This may arise should the Group become too dependent on a single source of
financing, or if the maturity structure of the Group’s debt portfolio is too concentrated. In order to mitigate
funding risk, the Group aims to spread its debt across different lenders, different maturities and different forms of
financing.

Ahlstrom-Munksjö has outlined the following guidelines in its Treasury Policy, which aim to mitigate the
funding risk. The Group aims to ensure that not more than 50% of its debt portfolio will mature in the same
12-month period and the average maturity of the long-term finance should be at least 2 years. The Group also
aims to avoid the inclusion of covenants in all types of financing agreements.

**Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk is the risk that Ahlstrom-Munksjö will not have sufficient funds to pay foreseen and
unforeseen expenditures. In order to mitigate this risk, Group Treasury monitors the Group’s cash pools, bank
agreements and liquidity to ensure at all times that there is sufficient liquidity. The liquidity situation is
monitored in such way that Ahlstrom-Munksjö Group at all times has sufficient liquidity. The Group’s cash
accounts are included in the cash pools.

**Financial instruments subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting agreements and similar agreements**

Ahlstrom-Munksjö have a number of counterparties in respect of which the Group is both buyer and seller.
Consequently, Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s gross financial assets can be significant before offsetting. Offsetting is
typically limited within specific products and it is possible when payment and receipt from the same counterparty occur simultaneously. These financial assets and liabilities are not offset on the balance sheet as the
offsetting in the balance sheet is allowed only in certain, limited circumstances.

The table below shows the Group’s derivative contracts that are subject to offsetting agreements. The
column ‘net amount ‘shows the impact on the Group’s balance sheet if all set-off rights were exercised. Under
the terms of these arrangements, only where certain credit events occur (such as default), the net position owing/
receivable to a single counterparty in the same currency will be taken as owing and all the relevant arrangements
terminated. As the Group does not presently have a legally enforceable right of set-off, these amounts have not
been offset in the balance sheet.

The Group considers that the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and
trade and other payables provide a reasonable approximation of fair value, due to the short maturity and liquid
nature of these elements. In addition, the Group considers the carrying amount and fair value of bank loans the
same as the Group’s credit spread has not moved, they are tied to a variable rate, and as the borrowings are
mainly withdrawn during the second half of the financial year.

**Accounting policies**

**Financial assets at amortised cost**

The group classifies its financial assets as at amortised cost only if both of the following criteria are met:.

   - the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash flows,

   - the contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest.

The financial assets in this group are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method if the time
value of money is significant. Gains and losses are recognized in income when the loans and receivables are
derecognized or impaired (refer to note 14), as well as through the amortization process. This category of
financial assets includes trade and other receivables and cash equivalents (refer to note 17).

**Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through income statement**

The Group classifies derivatives for which hedge accounting is not applied as financial assets at fair value
through income statement (FVPL).

Financial assets at fair value through income statement are carried on the balance sheet at fair value with
gains or losses recognized in the income statement. Derivatives, other than those designated as effective hedging
instruments, are classified as held for trading and are included in this category.

Other investments include unlisted shares and interests carried at fair value. Fair value changes are
recognised in the other comprehensive income. For unlisted shares and interests the fair value cannot be
measured reliably and therefore the management considers that the cost is a reasonable approximation of the fair
value.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**19 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (Continued)**

**Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost**

Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost are initially recognized at fair value, net of transaction costs.
For interest-bearing loans and borrowings this is the fair value of the proceeds received net of issue costs
associated with the borrowing.

After initial recognition, other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the
effective interest method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or
premium on settlement. Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or cancellation of liabilities are
recognized in interest and other income and finance costs respectively.

This category of financial liabilities includes trade and other payables and debt (refer to note 17).

There has not been significant changes in the measurement bases of the finacial assets and liabilities due to
transition to IFRS 9.

**Fair values of financial assets and liabilities**

The financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the balance sheet have been classified based on
the three hierarchy levels:

   - level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can
access at the measurement date;

   - level 2: inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly;

   - level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

The Group considers that the carrying amount of cash, trade receivables and various deposits provide a
reasonable approximation of fair value, due to the short maturity and liquid nature of these elements.

For financial liabilities at amortized cost, the fair value of financial liabilities is determined using:

   - the quoted price for listed instruments (a detailed analysis is performed in the case of a material
decrease in liquidity to evidence whether the observed price corresponds to the fair value; otherwise the
quoted price is adjusted);

   - the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted using rates observed by the Group at the
end of the period for bank loans, finance leases and other instruments.

Fair values of derivatives are based on valuations provided by external parties using various valuation
techniques. The fair value of the forward exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange rates at the
balance sheet date with the resulting fair value discounted to present value.

**Accounting policies**

**Subsidiaries, joint operations and associates**

Subsidiaries are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by Ahlstrom-Munksjö controls, ie. when the
Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement and has the ability to affect those
returns through exercising power. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date control is achieved to the date
when the Group ceases to exercise power.

Associated companies are those in which the Group has a significant influence over operational and
financial policies. Significant influence is the power to participate in, but not control or jointly control, the
financial and operating decisions of the investee. These investments are accounted for using the equity method.

The Group recognises its direct right to the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operations and
its share of any jointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in accordance with the
Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s contractual rights and obligations.

**Transactions eliminated on consolidation and transactions between the owners of the parent**

Transactions between Group companies, including intra-group receivables and liabilities, income or
expenses and unrealized gains or losses are eliminated in full. Unrealized gains arising from transactions with
associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest, unless otherwise contractually
agreed by the parties. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains, but only to the extent
that there is no evidence of impairment. Transactions with the owners of the parent are reported within
shareholders’ equity. Transactions with non-controlling interests are reported as transactions with equity owners
of the Group. Divestments to and purchases from non-controlling interests result in gains and losses for the
Group, which are reported in equity.

KPMG Oy Ab has provided non-audit services to the entities of Ahlstrom-Munksjö Group in total of
EUR 0.1 million (EUR 0.5 millon) during the financial year 2018.

**23 NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS**

**IFRS 16**

The new standard, IFRS 16 Leases is effective on January 1, 2019. The new standard will affect primarily
the accounting by lessees and will result in the recognition of the majority of leases on the balance sheet. The
new lease standard removes the previous distinction between operating and finance leases and requires
recognition of an asset (the right to use the leased asset) and a financial liability to make lease payments. In
accordance with IFRS 16 the operating expenses relating to leases will be replaced by depreciations and interest
expenses, resulting in a change in our key metrics e.g. EBITDA. Due to the changes the result for the period will
also be affected as the total expense will typically be higher in the earlier years of a lease and lower in later years.

Ahlstrom-Munksjö will adopt IFRS 16 upon initial application January 1, 2019 using a simplified approach
and thus comparative figures will not be restated. The Group will use the other available practical expedients,
including the exclusion of short-term leases with a term to maturity of less than 12 months, low-value leases and
leases of intangible assets.

A lease is a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a
period of time in exchange for consideration. Ahlstrom-Munksjö initially measures the lease liability at the
present value of the lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments are discounted using the
interest rate implicit in the lease or the incremental borrowing rate. The payments are based on the lease contracts
and respective payment schedules.

Ahlstrom-Munksjö has analyzed the leasing contracts and collected the lease contract data as of
December 31, 2018. The implementation of IFRS 16 will increase the lease liability and the property, plant and
equipment in the balance sheet on January 1, 2019 by approximately EUR 60 million. In the 2019 consolidated
income statement, the operating expenses will decrease, while depreciations and interest costs will increase as
result of lease expenses capitalized in accordance with IFRS 16. This will lead to an improvement in EBITDA.

**IFRIC 23**

IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments clarifies how to recognise and measure deferred and
current income tax assets and liabilities where there is uncertainty over a tax treatment, including:

   - that each uncertain tax treatment should be considered separately or together as a group, depending on
which approach better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty

   - that the entity should assume a tax authority will examine the uncertain tax treatments and have full
knowledge of all related information

   - that the entity should reflect the effect of an uncertainty in its income tax accounting when it is not
probable that the tax authorities will accept the treatment

   - that the impact of the uncertainty should be measured using either the most likely amount or the
expected value method, depending on which method better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty
