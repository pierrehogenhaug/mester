The Temporary Notes will be issued by the Issuer under a temporary indenture (the “Temporary Indenture”), dated as of February 11, 2021 (the “Issue Date”) entered into by, among others, the Issuer and the Temporary Trustee (as defined herein). On or about the date of the completion of the Fidelix Acquisition (as defined herein) (the “Completion Date”), the Temporary Notes will be automatically exchanged for an equal aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2025 (the “Additional Notes”) (such exchange, the “Temporary Notes Exchange”). The Additional Notes will be issued as additional notes under the indenture dated December 6, 2019 entered into by, among others, the Issuer, the Guarantors (as defined herein) and the Trustee (as defined herein) pursuant to which the Issuer issued €250.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes (the “Original Notes”). The Temporary Notes will have the same terms as the Original Notes, except as described herein. The Temporary Notes will trade separately from the Original Notes, will have different ISIN/common code numbers than the Original Notes and will not be fungible with the Original Notes. The Additional Notes will have the same terms as the Original Notes and will be treated as a single class together with the Original Notes for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. After giving effect to the issuance of the Additional Notes, the aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding under the Indenture will be €350.0 million. The Temporary Notes, the Additional Notes and the Original Notes are referred to collectively in this offering memorandum as the “Notes” unless indicated otherwise. The Issuer will pay interest on the Notes at a per annum rate equal to three-month EURIBOR (with a floor of 0%) plus 5%, reset quarterly. Interest on the Temporary Notes and the Additional Notes will accrue from December 15, 2020, and will be payable quarterly in arrear on each March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15, commencing on March 15, 2021. The Notes will mature on May 15, 2025. The Issuer is entitled at its option to redeem all or a portion of the Notes at the applicable redemption prices set forth under the heading “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption” plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. In addition, the Issuer may redeem all, but not part, of the Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (including accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any) upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law. Upon the occurrence of certain defined events constituting a change of control, each holder of the Notes may require the Issuer to repurchase all or a portion of its Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any. Pending the consummation of the Fidelix Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers (as defined herein) will, concurrently with the issuance of the Temporary Notes on the Issue Date, deposit with the Escrow Agent (as defined herein) an amount equal to the gross proceeds of the Offering sold on the Issue Date into the Escrow Account (as defined herein). The Escrow Account will be controlled by the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Account, together with the Escrowed Property (as defined herein), will be pledged on a first-priority basis in favor of the Temporary Trustee or the Security Agent for the benefit of the holders of the Temporary Notes, pursuant to the Escrow Account Charge (as defined herein). The release of escrow proceeds will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. If the release does not take place on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date (as defined herein), or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Temporary Notes will be subject to a Special Mandatory Redemption (as defined herein) at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price of the Temporary Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, from the Issue Date to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined herein). See “Description of the Temporary _Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”_ The Original Notes are, and the Temporary Notes and the Additional Notes will be, senior secured obligations of the Issuer, and the Original Notes rank, and the Temporary Notes and Additional Notes will rank, senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s future debt that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and will rank pari passu in right of payment with the Issuer’s existing and future debt that is not so subordinated, including the Issuer’s obligations under the Super Senior Facilities (as defined herein). The Temporary Notes will not be guaranteed. To secure the payment of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price, on the Issue Date, the obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Temporary Notes will be secured by a first-priority security interest over the Escrow Account pursuant to the Escrow Charge. The obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Original Notes are, and upon the Temporary Notes Exchange, the obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Additional Notes will be, guaranteed, jointly and severally on a senior basis, by each subsidiary of the Issuer that is a guarantor under the Super Senior Facilities. The Notes Guarantees (as defined herein) will rank senior in right of payment to the respective Guarantor’s future debt that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Notes Guarantee and will rank pari passu in right of payment with the respective Guarantor’s existing and future debt that is not so subordinated, including such Guarantor’s obligations under the Super Senior Facilities. The Original Notes are, and upon the Temporary Notes Exchange, the Additional Notes will be, secured by a first-priority security interest in the same assets that secure the Issuer’s and Guarantors’ obligations under the Super Senior Facilities, subject to certain agreed security principles and agreed exceptions. The Original Notes are, and upon the Temporary Notes Exchange, the Additional Notes will be, secured by the Completion Date Collateral (as defined herein). Within 60 business days of the Completion Date, the Original Notes and the Additional Notes will be secured by the Post-Completion Date Collateral (as defined herein). Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of enforcement of the security interests over the Collateral (as defined herein) and certain distressed disposals, holders of Original Notes and Additional Notes will receive proceeds from the Collateral only after the Super Senior Facilities, certain hedging obligations and certain other indebtedness permitted to be incurred on a priority basis under the Indenture, if any, have been repaid in full. The validity, enforceability and, in respect of the security interests over the Collateral, priority and ranking of the Notes Guarantees and the security interests and the liability of the Guarantors, are subject to the limitations described in “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and _Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests.” The Temporary Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of all of our subsidiaries,_ and the Additional Notes will be structurally subordinated to all obligations of the Issuer’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Additional Notes and effectively subordinated to any existing and future debt of the Issuer and the Guarantors that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Additional Notes, to the extent of the value of such property and assets. The Original Notes have been admitted to listing on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”). There is currently no market for the Temporary Notes or the Additional Notes. Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”) for the listing of and permission to deal in the Temporary Notes and the Additional Notes on the Official List of the Exchange. There can be no assurance, however, that the Temporary Notes or the Additional Notes will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the Temporary Notes or the Additional Notes will be granted or that such listing will be maintained.

The Additional Notes will have the same terms as the Original Notes and will be treated as a single class together with the Original Notes for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. After giving effect to the issuance of the Additional Notes, the aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding under the Indenture will be \u20ac350.0 million. The Temporary Notes, the Additional Notes and the Original Notes are referred to collectively in this offering memorandum as the \u201cNotes\u201d unless indicated otherwise. The Issuer will pay interest on the Notes at a per annum rate equal to three-month EURIBOR (with a floor of 0%) plus 5%, reset quarterly. Interest on the Temporary Notes and the Additional Notes will accrue from December 15, 2020, and will be payable quarterly in arrear on each March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15, commencing on March 15, 2021. The Notes will mature on May 15, 2025. The Issuer is entitled at its option to redeem all or a portion of the Notes at the applicable redemption prices set forth under the heading \u201cDescription of the Notes\u2014Optional Redemption\u201d plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. In addition, the Issuer may redeem all, but not part, of the Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (including accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any) upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law. Upon the occurrence of certain defined events constituting a change of control, each holder of the Notes may require the Issuer to repurchase all or a portion of its Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any. Pending the consummation of the Fidelix Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers (as defined herein) will, concurrently with the issuance of the Temporary Notes on the Issue Date, deposit with the Escrow Agent (as defined herein) an amount equal to the gross proceeds of the Offering sold on the Issue Date into the Escrow Account (as defined herein). The Escrow Account will be controlled by the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Account, together with the Escrowed Property (as defined herein), will be pledged on a first-priority basis in favor of the Temporary Trustee or the Security Agent for the benefit of the holders of the Temporary Notes, pursuant to the Escrow Account Charge (as defined herein). The release of escrow proceeds will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. If the release does not take place on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date (as defined herein), or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Temporary Notes will be subject to a Special Mandatory Redemption (as defined herein) at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price of the Temporary Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, from the Issue Date to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined herein). See \u201cDescription of the Temporary _Notes\u2014Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.\u201d_ The Original Notes are, and the Temporary Notes and the Additional Notes will be, senior secured obligations of the Issuer, and the Original Notes rank, and the Temporary Notes and Additional Notes will rank, senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer\u2019s future debt that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and will rank pari passu in right of payment with the Issuer\u2019s existing and future debt that is not so subordinated, including the Issuer\u2019s obligations under the Super Senior Facilities (as defined herein). The Temporary Notes will not be guaranteed. To secure the payment of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price, on the Issue Date, the obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Temporary Notes will be secured by a first-priority security interest over the Escrow Account pursuant to the Escrow Charge. The obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Original Notes are, and upon the Temporary Notes Exchange, the obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Additional Notes will be, guaranteed, jointly and severally on a senior basis, by each subsidiary of the Issuer that is a guarantor under the Super Senior Facilities. The Notes Guarantees (as defined herein) will rank senior in right of payment to the respective Guarantor\u2019s future debt that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Notes Guarantee and will rank pari passu in right of payment with the respective Guarantor\u2019s existing and future debt that is not so subordinated, including such Guarantor\u2019s obligations under the Super Senior Facilities. The Original Notes are, and upon the Temporary Notes Exchange, the Additional Notes will be, secured by a first-priority security interest in the same assets that secure the Issuer\u2019s and Guarantors\u2019 obligations under the Super Senior Facilities, subject to certain agreed security principles and agreed exceptions. The Original Notes are, and upon the Temporary Notes Exchange, the Additional Notes will be, secured by the Completion Date Collateral (as defined herein). Within 60 business days of the Completion Date, the Original Notes and the Additional Notes will be secured by the Post-Completion Date Collateral (as defined herein). Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of enforcement of the security interests over the Collateral (as defined herein) and certain distressed disposals, holders of Original Notes and Additional Notes will receive proceeds from the Collateral only after the Super Senior Facilities, certain hedging obligations and certain other indebtedness permitted to be incurred on a priority basis under the Indenture, if any, have been repaid in full. The validity, enforceability and, in respect of the security interests over the Collateral, priority and ranking of the Notes Guarantees and the security interests and the liability of the Guarantors, are subject to the limitations described in \u201cCertain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and _Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests.\u201d The Temporary Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of all of our subsidiaries,_ and the Additional Notes will be structurally subordinated to all obligations of the Issuer\u2019s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Additional Notes and effectively subordinated to any existing and future debt of the Issuer and the Guarantors that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Additional Notes, to the extent of the value of such property and assets. The Original Notes have been admitted to listing on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the \u201cExchange\u201d). There is currently no market for the Temporary Notes or the Additional Notes. Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the \u201cAuthority\u201d) for the listing of and permission to deal in the Temporary Notes and the Additional Notes on the Official List of the Exchange. There can be no assurance, however, that the Temporary Notes or the Additional Notes will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the Temporary Notes or the Additional Notes will be granted or that such listing will be maintained. The Exchange is not a regulated market pursuant to the provisions of Directive 2004/39/EC on markets in financial instruments, as amended, or Article 2(1)(13A) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.

Since these transactions are not covered by any IFRS standard, the Group has used the historical financial information of the entities included in the combined reporting entity when preparing the Financial Statements. All intra-group transactions between legal entities within the reporting entity have been eliminated. As a result, the combined financial statements represent the economic activities of the reporting entity that will be formed after the transaction.

As a result, the Unaudited Condensed Interim Financial Statements and the 2019 financial information contained in the Audited Combined Financial Statements are prepared after implementing IFRS 16, and the 2018 and 2017 financial information contained in the Audited Combined Financial Statements is prepared prior to the implementation of IFRS 16. The comparison figures for 2018 and earlier periods have not been restated, and are thus not directly comparable where there are differences caused by the implementation of IFRS 16. See Note 1 to the Audited Combined Financial Statements. viii ----- The financial information included in this offering memorandum is not intended to comply with the applicable accounting requirements of the Securities Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC which would apply if the Temporary Notes or the Additional Notes were being registered with the SEC. The information included in this offering memorandum was not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the Unites States (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). There could be significant differences between IFRS, as applied by us, and U.S. GAAP. We neither describe the differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP nor reconcile our IFRS financial statements to U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, such information is not available to investors, and investors should consider this in making their investment decision. The financial information included in this offering memorandum would require the modification, reformulation or exclusion of certain financial measures. In addition, changes would be required in the presentation of certain other information.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}"
1629,Final Offerings 2020.md,3,STABILIZATION,3.11,Non-IFRS Measures,3.11.1,,"We have included certain non-IFRS financial measures in this offering memorandum, including EBITA, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, and certain financial ratios. Under our presentation: Š “Adjusted EBITA” means EBITA adjusted for items affecting comparability (including impairment of rights-of-use assets), which are categorized as acquisition, integration and start-up costs, restructuring costs, transformation costs and other items affecting comparability, as described under “Management’s Discussion _and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Items Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations.” Adjusted EBITA on a segment basis_ also excludes the impact of IFRS 16 on the combined financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 and the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2020 and is presented before intragroup eliminations. Š “Adjusted EBITDA” means Adjusted EBITA before depreciation of property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets, and after certain lease accounting adjustments to exclude the impact of IFRS 16 on the combined financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 and the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2020. Š “Adjusted EBITA Margin” and “Adjusted EBITDA Margin” mean Adjusted EBITA and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, divided by net revenue for the period, expressed as a percentage. Š “Cash Conversion” means Free Cash Flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA. Š “Changes in Net Working Capital” means the sum of the increase or decrease in inventories, the increase or decrease in net work in progress, the increase or decrease in total trade receivables, the increase or decrease in reserve for bad debt, the increase or decrease in other receivables, the increase or decrease in trade payables and the increase or decrease in other payables for the relevant period. Š “EBITA” means profit for the year/period excluding tax, net financial items and amortization of intangible assets. EBITA on a segment basis also excludes the impact of IFRS 16 on the combined financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 and the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2020 and is presented before intragroup eliminations. Š “EBITA Margin” means EBITA divided by net revenue for the period, expressed as a percentage. Š “Free Cash Flow” means Adjusted EBITDA, less the sum of Changes in Net Working Capital and Net Capital Expenditures for the period. Š “Net Capital Expenditures” means investments in intangible and tangible fixed assets, less the sales value (cash proceeds) of tangible and intangible fixed assets for the period, and including net leasing expenditures related to vehicles, which primarily relate to our car fleet, and after certain lease accounting adjustments to exclude the impact of IFRS 16 on the combined financial information for the year ended December 31, 2019 and the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2020. Š “Net Working Capital” means the sum of inventories, net work in progress, total trade receivables, reserve for bad debt, other receivables, trade payables and other payables for the relevant period. Š “Order backlog” means the remaining revenue expected to be recognized from ongoing projects subject to existing contractual commitments as of the end of the relevant period. Š “Order intake” means the revenue expected to be recognized on projects from (i) new contractual commitments entered into during the relevant period, plus (ii) changes during the relevant period to existing contractual commitments entered into during prior periods. ix ----- Š “Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA” means Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted to reflect the pro forma EBITDA contribution of the Fidelix Acquisition, certain other acquisitions that were not consolidated for the full twelve months ended September 30, 2020 and operational cost savings initiatives that were completed by December 31, 2019. We present EBITA, Adjusted EBITA, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and other non-IFRS measures referred to above because we believe they assist investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. The foregoing measures have limitations as analytical tools. Some of these limitations are: Š they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; Š they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; Š with the exception of net interest expense, they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service interest or principal payments on our debt; Š although depreciation and amortization are non-monetary charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and similar non-IFRS financial measures do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements; Š some of the large and unusual expenses we eliminate in calculating EBITA, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and similar non-IFRS financial measures reflect cash payments that were made, or will be made in the future; and Š the fact that other companies in our industry may calculate EBITA, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and similar non-IFRS financial measures differently than we do, which limits their usefulness as comparative measures. We present EBITA, Adjusted EBITA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as we believe they will be useful to investors and analysts in reviewing our performance and comparing our results to other operators. However, neither EBITA, Adjusted EBITA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA are IFRS measures and you are encouraged to evaluate any adjustments to IFRS measures yourself and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. You should not consider EBITA, Adjusted EBITA, Adjusted EBITDA or Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (a) as an alternative to operating profit/(loss) as a measure of our operating performance; (b) as an alternative to cashflow from operating and investment activities as a measure of our ability to meet cash needs; or (c) as an alternative to any other measure of performance under IFRS. Because of these limitations, as well as further limitations discussed above, the non-IFRS measures presented should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with IFRS. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our results in accordance with IFRS and using non-IFRS measures only supplementally.",,as_expected,2020,384,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: nan\nText: We have included certain non-IFRS financial measures in this offering memorandum, including EBITA, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, and certain financial ratios.

1629,Final Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.1,,"We are one of the Nordic region’s leading providers of complete installation and service solutions, with our primary activities focusing on electrical engineering, heating and sanitation, ventilation and automation, as well as key competencies in data and telecom, industrial pipes, district heating, cooling, sprinklers, security and electrical workshop and field services. We hold a strong position in the growing installation market in the Nordic region (comprising Sweden, Norway and Finland), which are estimated at approximately SEK 98 billion, SEK 75 billion and SEK 59 billion, respectively, and have a combined approximate value of SEK 231 billion as of December 31, 2019, and in 2019, we had the second largest share of Sweden’s installation market by revenue according to Prognoscentret. Moreover, in December 2020, we entered into a sale and purchase agreement to acquire Fidelix, a technology-driven building automation service company, which is expected to provide us with a market-leading position within the building automation market in the Nordics. We provide installation and service assignments in various types of properties, industrial facilities and infrastructure projects for a diverse customer base consisting over 20,000 large and small customers, which include construction companies, the public sector, property owners and industrial companies. Our strong relationships with our customers have contributed to an order backlog of SEK 8,245 million and an LTM order intake of SEK 9,859 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2020, and we currently have over 3,000 ongoing projects. We take on primarily two types of assignments: contractor assignments and service assignments. The proportion of contractor assignments and service assignments represented 60% and 40%, respectively, of our net revenue for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020. Our operations are decentralized and governed based on a shared framework, clear allocation of roles and responsibilities and systematic monitoring. Our current operating organization is divided into five specific business areas: three in Sweden (Assemblin El, Assemblin VS and Assemblin Ventilation), one in Norway (Assemblin Norway) and one in Finland (Assemblin Finland), comprising over 166 branches across over 100 locations with over 5,800 employees in the Nordic region. We believe that our decentralized business model contributes to the profitability of our operations. This decentralized and entrepreneurial business model allows us to swiftly adjust to a largely variable cost structure and promotes enterprise and accountability at all levels of our structure with the president of each business area being responsible, together with their management groups, for the operations and earnings in their respective business areas. 1 ----- The following map shows the branch footprint of our business areas, representing the locations in which we operated in the Nordic region as of September 30, 2020. We have been owned by Triton Partners since 2015, and since then have expanded our geographical presence and volumes through the acquisition of 40 additional companies to date (excluding Fidelix), the largest of which being a carve-out from construction company Skanska, Skanska Installation, acquired in 2016. Our organic and inorganic growth has made us into a complete installation and service partner, with the strength of a multidisciplinary group and the personal presence of a local company. In the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, we had total net revenue of SEK 10,133 million, a net profit for the period of SEK 42 million, EBITA of SEK 304 million, Adjusted EBITA of SEK 569 million and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of SEK 851 million. This was supported by our strong order backlog, which stood at SEK 8,245 million as of September 30, 2020. The table below sets out the net revenue, Adjusted EBITA (and corresponding margin), order backlog, share of service assignments, average number of FTE employees and number of branches for each of our business areas as of and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020.",,as_expected,2020,384,

We are outperforming the market and gaining market share; specifically, in 2019, we held the second largest market share (8.4%) of the estimated SEK 98 billion installation market in Sweden, representing a market share increase of 75 basis points between 2017 and 2019. Our presence in Norway and Finland has also shown strong growth, with our market share (1.6%) of the estimated SEK 75 billion installation market in Norway increasing by 44 basis points between 2017 and 2019, and our market share (1%) of the estimated SEK 59 billion installation market in Finland increasing by 8 basis points over the same period. We have operated through our constituent subsidiaries in our key markets of Sweden, Norway and Finland for more than half a century and have a track record of completing contracts on time and in line with customer specifications, which is underpinned by our commitment to attaining the highest levels of customer satisfaction. We believe that brand awareness and market reputation are key factors for customers deciding upon a particular installation and services provider and that our established portfolio and track record, therefore, provide us with a significant competitive advantage. Importantly, we have developed high network density in our chosen markets, including nation-wide Sweden, the greater Oslo area (Norway) and in the Helsinki-Turku-Tampere triangle (Finland), with our footprint tailored to maximize regional leadership in an industry where local scale matters. Our market presence and the scale and geographic reach of our operations give us a clear advantage over our competitors, which in our fragmented market comprise mostly small or medium-sized enterprises. This is particularly the case with respect to contracts for major projects, which typically generate stable revenue streams and cash flows, as we are one of only a small number of companies in our markets with sufficient resources and expertise to be mandated on, and successfully execute, such contracts due to the scale, diversity and quality of our installation and service offering. Our geographic reach has enabled us to attain significant market positions in the regions where we operate, particularly in Sweden where, in terms of 2017 net revenue, we had nine regions ranked either number one or number two in electrical engineering, ten in heating and sanitation and six in ventilation. Only one of our competitors had more regions ranked higher in these categories than Assemblin in Sweden. Our Group and local scale provide differentiating competitive advantages. At the Group level, we are able to utilize our procurement expertise to optimize sourcing supplier terms within each business area and leverage on our digital capabilities. In addition, we leverage certain central functions such as finance, legal, communication and our central IT platform. At the local level, our geographic network comprises over 166 branches across over 100 locations in the Nordic region, in close proximity to our customers. In certain locations, our business areas share branch premises allowing for significant cross-selling and cost-reduction opportunities. In addition to being better positioned to win local tenders, our cross-staffing ability between branches allows us to optimize project selection. Further, our local scale has allowed us to build a workforce of over 5,800 employees in the Nordic region with many employees preferring to work for a larger company due to supportive and clear governance, stability, brand awareness and personal development opportunities. 3 -----",,as_expected,2020,384,
1629,Final Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Competitive Strengths,9.3.2,Execution excellence delivered by local branch managers and specialist staff,"We believe that our decentralized business model contributes to the profitability of our operations. Our current operating organization is divided into five specific business areas (Assemblin El, Assemblin VS, Assemblin Ventilation, Assemblin Norway and Assemblin Finland), which in turn consist of regions, divisions and branches where local decision making and project execution is undertaken. This decentralized and entrepreneurial business model allows us to swiftly adjust our largely variable cost structure (see “—Resilient and agile business model”) and promotes entrepreneurial culture and accountability at all levels of our structure with the president of each business area being responsible, together with their management groups, for the operations and earnings in their respective business areas. We believe that one of our key strengths is the division of our business by business area instead of by region. The focus on business areas allows our managers and their teams to prioritize their technical areas of expertise, it provides career development opportunities for our talented employees within their respective business lines, as well as it is also an important advantage in the mergers and acquisition context where the typical target company has one technical discipline, allowing the target company to join the appropriate part of our business which focuses on the target’s core strength. For example, we expect the Fidelix Group to be an independent business area within the Group, and Fidelix’s experienced management team will continue to play a critical role in Fidelix’s ongoing operations to help ensure continued success. Through our decentralized business model, our branch managers are incentivized to create value and lead a specialized and skilled workforce. Specifically, the interplay between specialist staff and strongly incentivized branch managers has led to improved profitability. Our specialist staff are supported by the Assemblin Academy and compulsory web courses to enhance their skillsets. In addition, employees are guided by clear development plans and career ladders, which, in turn, allows us to attract top quality employees. The focus on incentivizing specialist staff through measures such as the Assemblin Academy as well as our staff incentive plan has contributed to industry leading employee satisfaction at Assemblin, underpinning our ability to retain specialist staff. Specifically, in 2019, we achieved an employee net promoter score (“NPS”) of 18, compared to 4 in 2012, which was substantially higher than the industry average of 9. Furthermore, we have an employer reputation score of 3.3 in Sweden, which is the highest among our key competitors. On the branch manager side, branch managers’ decision-making is based on their in-depth local market knowledge and customer relationships supported by a specialized staff allowing branch managers to reduce costs and provide a geared installation and service offering to customers. Branch managers are strongly incentivized on EBITA Margin targets as well as efficient working capital management. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, enhanced monitoring at the branch level has allowed successful management of market and operational challenges stemming from COVID-19 restrictions. We have also experienced successful management of personnel shortfall due to sick leaves during COVID-19 through effective reallocation between assignments, allowing us to continue relying on our specialist staff. As a result of our investment in specialist staff and incentivizing our branch managers, the proportion of lossmaking branches has reduced from 38% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 19% for the year ended December 31, 2019, and these branches contributed only 14% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. The proportion of branches delivering over 7% of EBITA Margin has increased over the same period from 22% to 40%. The table below outlines the split of branches’ profitability level by EBITA Margin for the periods indicated, based on management estimates.",,as_expected,2020,384,

This high revenue visibility allows us to take a more stringent approach in our margin selection criteria. Our order intake volumes grow our backlog over time. Between September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2020, our order intake increased by 7.1% to SEK 7,252 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, compared to SEK 6,774 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2018. Moreover, we experienced our highest annual order intakes to date in the year ended December 31, 2019, reaching SEK 11,258 million (compared to SEK 9,459 million in 2018), which was driven in particular by two large orders: the Stockholm Bypass project from the Swedish Transportation Administration and the new health care building in the Malmö hospital district, which contributed SEK 520 million and SEK 867 million, respectively, to our order intake during that period. Order backlog as of September 30, 2020 was SEK 8,245 million, compared to SEK 6,780 million as of September 30, 2018, and the order intake for 2019 resulted in our reaching our highest annual order intake to date of SEK 8,478 million as of December 31, 2019.

Branch managers are continuously supported and monitored at the 4 ----- regional, business area and Group level to ensure appropriate risk management and improved profitability. This support is carried out by, among other things, project selection controls and project execution controls. In relation to project selection, tenders are approved based on project size, assuming standard contractual terms. Projects under €1 million can be approved directly by the branch office, with projects between €1 million to €2 million and €2 million to €5 million required to be approved at the region and business level, respectively. Projects between €5 million to €10 million must be approved at the Group level and contracts over €10 million are required to be approved by our Board. With respect to project execution, branches are supported by an established system of financial, internal and management controls.",,as_expected,2020,384,

1629,Final Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.7,Quarter ended:,9.7.1,Resilient and agile business model,"Our decentralized and entrepreneurial business model allows us to swiftly adjust our largely variable cost structure. Installation is the last part of the typical construction project, with multi-technical service providers having solid predictability of the project pipeline. As a result of our late stage involvement in projects, branch managers are able to identify early signs in the changes of market dynamics and adjust our variable cost base as necessary. Our ability to proactively manage or swiftly react to such changes in market dynamics is supported by our lean and decentralized operational organization of five business areas in three countries, spread across over 166 branches. Approximately 89% of our cost structure during the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 was variable or semi-variable, which provides us with substantial operational flexibility. Additionally, although to date the installation market has proved to be relatively resilient to the COVID-19 pandemic and we believe the underlying drivers for long-term growth remain, we have experienced increased competition due to more uncertain market conditions. In light of this uncertainty, we believe it is beneficial to be a large, stable player with an ability to identify and react quickly to market changes, which we believe our leading market position, strong financial position and decentralized business model allows us to achieve. Further, branch managers have a diverse end-market exposure with a high share of service assignments and mainly smaller projects. Based on our end-market analysis conducted for our largest business areas, Electrical and Heating & Sanitation, in terms of net revenue, between January 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020, a large part of our net revenue originated from cycle-resilient end-markets such as healthcare (10%), education & culture (8%), infrastructure (2%) and service assignments (42%). Further, we had limited exposure to the Swedish residential market as approximately 12% of our end-market exposure was attributable to project assignments in the residential market, with new residential builds representing an estimate of less than 5% of our total project revenue. Other limited end-market exposures include business (3%), offices (9%), hospitality (2%), warehouses (2%) and industrial (8%). Our business also has limited dependency on a specific customer or type of contract. According to the Group’s management estimates, our top ten customers accounted for approximately 30% of our net revenue for the for the year ended December 31, 2019. Further, based on net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019, projects (which includes both installation projects as well as certain service projects subject to percentage of completion accounting) under SEK 50 million, between SEK 50-100 million, over SEK 100 million represented 56%, 5%, 3% of our net revenue, respectively and the remaining 36% being other service assignments. Following Triton’s acquisition of the Group, we have pursued a strategy of low-risk and accretive bolt-on acquisitions in order to expand our business. Specifically, with Triton as our owner, we have grown through the acquisition of 40 additional companies (excluding Fidelix), the largest of which being a carve-out from construction company Skanska, Skanska Installation, acquired in 2016. The rest of our acquisitions comprised companies with an average revenue of approximately SEK 48 million and 25 employees. When completing an acquisition, we anticipate paying a multiple of approximately 4-6 times the target’s EBITA, consistent with the multiple for our recent historical acquisitions. For more information, see “—History.” We believe that our established track-record of low-risk bolt-on acquisitions in a consolidating market has allowed us to successfully realize synergies and integrate the workforce, and we intend to continue to pursue acquisitions in order to increase our market presence, our service offering and our service capacity.",,as_expected,2020,384,

Even when new contracts appear highly likely to be awarded as a result of our Integrated Project Delivery (“IPD”) (see “Business—Competitive Strengths”) pipeline, we exclude them until they are signed. In addition, the lead time on our backlog projects has been increasingly extended due to capacity constraints, which now requires customers to book projects earlier on. We currently hold a strong pipeline of large, more technical and publicly-funded contracts due to current structural needs for schools, hospitals and transport infrastructures in the Nordic region. We also benefit from an increasingly high rate of recurring service business and have experienced a meaningful increase in the conversion rate from project assignments, which primarily consist of new installation or the redevelopment of, and adaptations to, technical systems in buildings, plants, to service assignments, which comprise the operation, maintenance, repair, replacement, reconfiguration and monitoring of installations in buildings, plants and infrastructure. For example, the net revenue of our service business increased from SEK 2,922 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 to SEK 3,833 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, representing 35.8% and 38.4% of our total net revenue of SEK 8,169 million and SEK 9,978 million respectively. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, the net revenue of our service business was SEK 4,007 million, which represented 39.5% of our net revenue of SEK 10,133 million during this period. This 5 ----- increased service contribution improves our budget accuracy and drives profitable growth, particularly in the case of recurring services, which pose high barriers to entry for our competitors at the contract renewal stage. We endeavor to maximize client satisfaction and retention by taking a strategic approach to each customer relationship. This approach begins by establishing multiple touch points with the customer and developing a deep understanding of the client’s needs. Next, we offer a state-of-the-art digital platform that allows for continuous performance monitoring and improvement throughout each assignment. Finally, we provide a comprehensive breadth of service offerings and aim for performance beyond customer expectations in order to increase the likelihood of recurring service contracts going forward.",,as_expected,2020,384,

See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Presentation of Financial Information—Non-IFRS Measures.” For a reconciliation of these non-IFRS measures to IFRS financial information, see “Summary—Summary Combined Financial and Other _Information—Operating Data and Non-IFRS Financial Information.”_ Our high cash flow generation has been driven by our capital-lite operations together with efficient working capital management. Our operations require very limited capital expenditure, which primarily comprises tools, refurbishment and IT, with our Net Capital Expenditure representing 0.8% of net revenue for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020. Our service vehicle fleet which is directly linked to the growth of our service operations is being arranged through flexible financial lease arrangements. We have a high focus on working capital management across the Group and as a result our Net Working Capital has been negative, being negative SEK 173 million, or 2.1% as a percentage of net revenue (SEK 8,169 million) for the year ended December 31, 2017, negative SEK 363 million, or 4.1% as a percentage of net revenue (SEK 8,885 million) for the year ended December 31, 2018, negative SEK 391 million, or 3.9% as a percentage of net revenue (SEK 9,978 million) for the year ended December 31, 2019 and negative SEK 493 million, or 4.9% as a percentage of net revenue (SEK 10,133 million) for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020. For the definition of Net Working Capital, see “Presentation of Financial and Other Data—Non-IFRS Measures.” Our ability to generate Free Cash Flow has contributed to our growth and has allowed us to undertake our mergers and acquisition strategy and achieve deleveraging, including since the issuance of the Original Notes as demonstrated by the decrease in our ratio of total net debt to pro forma Adjusted EBITDA from 4.3x to 3.5x as of September 30, 2020 (without giving pro forma effect to this Offering).

We believe that we are well positioned to grow our leading local market positions throughout the Nordic region and strong local market positions by continuing to provide high-quality services and support to our customers and employees, and by focusing on our local operations. We intend to continue to operate a large, decentralized organization, with local branch units operating as individual profit centers.

However, we believe that there is scope to continue to increase our absolute margin level. While we differentiate our offering by providing consistent, high-quality installation and technical services and offering a wide range of services to our customers, we are also able to drive cost savings by driving best practices across our Group. In 2019, we completed our accelerated profitability improvement program targeted to optimize our branch network, reduce overhead expenditures and improve operational efficiency. This program provided us with tangible cost savings in 2019, and we intend to consolidate and build on the improvements achieved so far. Additionally, to continue to improve our margins and cash flow, we intend to continue focusing on project selection and execution to allow us to operate more efficiently and profitably in the short-term while reducing project risk in the long-term. Over time, we are also gaining a better understanding of key success factors and best practices by analyzing the operational data and profitability metrics on a project by project basis. We achieve this by measuring branch profitability and by creating a corporate culture where profitability is rewarded over volume.

We believe we have significant experience in identifying, executing and integrating acquisitions while remaining focused on our existing business. We also believe the acquisition of Fidelix will provide us with a platform for further acquisition-led growth, especially given Fidelix’s track-record of successful bolt-on acquisitions. Our focus on technical disciplines allows us to better approach likely targets and provide a compelling view of a common future.

Buildings are increasingly connected and involve smart, interconnected and automated technical systems. This represents a substantial growth opportunity for our business that we strive to take advantage of. In particular, the acquisition of Fidelix brings additional digitalization capabilities across the Group, which we expect to be a driver as we focus on the next-generation of installation across all of our business areas. Digitalization, however, does not only underpin our long-term growth profile, it is also an opportunity to connect construction sites to better inform decision-making and foster a closer collaboration across our teams but also with the various parties which we collaborate with on a construction site. Each of our business areas has dedicated digitalization managers mapping local initiatives and driving local digitalization efforts. Our central steering group involves members from all business areas and prioritizes initiatives according to Assemblin’s digital agenda. Our key successes have historically been on our market leading expertise in Building Information Modelling (“BIM”) where Assemblin has around 16 years of experience. This type of modelling is currently used both in large and small projects, improves clarity to all stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle, and makes it easier to achieve project and business goals. Other digital tools we have developed includes Assemblin eManageri which is a smart platform helping property managers and owners to monitor and manage energy efficiency in properties.",,as_expected,2020,384,

1629,Final Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.12,Fidelix,9.12.1,Overview of Fidelix Business,"Fidelix was founded in 2002 and has since grown into a technology-driven building automation service company with a leading market position in the Nordics. Using in-house developed technology, Fidelix covers the full value chain, from sales and deployment of products and systems, to cloud and aftermarket services. Fidelix currently operates in Finland and Sweden (accounting for approximately 70% and 30% of Fidelix’s 2020 net sales, respectively, based on Fidelix’s management accounts and before intragroup eliminations), with 20 regional offices and over 300 employees. Its experienced management team will be integrated within the Group and will continue to play a critical role in Fidelix’s ongoing operations to support continued success. Fidelix offers building management systems (“BMS”) for commercial buildings by combining hardware and software from its product portfolio to optimize building performance both from a cost and environmental perspective, while providing the building users with a healthier indoor environment. Fidelix also provides metering, cloud and IoT solutions for residential buildings (referred to as individual metering and debiting or “IMD”) through EcoGuard, which it acquired in April 2019. Fidelix provides its BMS and IMD services to a well-diversified customer base. Its customers include both public (representing almost half of its orderbook as of June 2020 based on Fidelix’s management accounts) and private end-customers across the commercial and residential market, for both new builds and renovations (accounting for over 40% and 55%, respectively, of net sales in 2019 based on Fidelix’s management accounts). Fidelix’s project portfolio includes both relatively large and small projects, with Fidelix’s management estimating that over 60% of its completed and ongoing projects individually generated sales of less than €200,000. As a result, Fidelix is able to cover a wider installed base, which totaled approximately 26,500 buildings as of January 2020 (based on Fidelix management’s estimates), approximately 15,500 of which comprise its BMS installed base (in Sweden and Finland), with the remainder comprising its IMD installed based (in Sweden). Fidelix’s installed base serves as a conduit for its aftermarket and cloud businesses and provides references and expertise across building types and deeper visibility into market outlook. Its three operational segments are: (i) products and cloud services (as part of its BMS offering); (ii) projects and maintenance (as part of its BMS offering); and (iii) measurement (as part of its IMD offering) (accounting for approximately 26%, 53% and 21% of Fidelix’s 2020 net sales, respectively, based on Fidelix’s management accounts and before intragroup eliminations). Fidelix’s BMS and IMD services allow for close collaboration with its customers throughout the life-cycle of their projects, whether through the development of solutions, assistance during the design and engineering phases, installation of the Fidelix products (in Finland) or the management of the building after the project’s completion. _Products and cloud services_ Fidelix’s BMS offers hardware and software products to create systems that allow for reliable monitoring of commercial buildings (including the monitoring of multiple systems and buildings through its centralized monitoring solution). The BMS system collects data from various sensors (such as temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide) and controls different processes in the building (such as ventilation, heating and cooling), using a purpose-built computer that is usually located in the technical room of the building. Fidelix also offers more advanced optimizations through cloud-based diagnostics and energy optimization solutions. Products are sold either to Fidelix’s projects business (its largest single source of product sales) or through its network of Finnish or Swedish system integrator partners, while its cloud services are offered directly to end-customers that have a Fidelix BMS in place. Although Fidelix’s products and cloud services are offered in both the Finnish and Swedish markets, its systems have been exported to other countries through Fidelix’s system integrator partners. _Projects and maintenance_ Through its project business offering, Fidelix offers a turn-key BMS service, which includes project management, technical design services, sourcing of hardware and software and programming and installation services. The project business serves as a route-to-market channel for Fidelix’s own BMS hardware and software 12 ----- products. Fidelix also offers an after-market services for its BMS, including on-site maintenance, system improvement and development services, sales and installation of additional components and upgrades and longterm service contracts. Fidelix’s turn-key BMS service is offered through participants in the new building construction markets that hire Fidelix for the relevant project (such as building automation designers, project management consultants, general contractors or HVAC contractors). Its aftermarket services, however, are offered directly to the building owners. These project and maintenance services are offered in Finland. _IMD_ Fidelix offers IMD solutions through its EcoGuard products and systems. These systems, which are typically installed in the apartments and in the building’s technical rooms, collect and communicate data to CURVES, the cloud-based IoT platform. The cloud software collects all the data for visualization, analysis, regulating energy consumption and individual debiting. In addition to providing tools for individual metering and debiting to assist residential building owners in managing their residential property portfolios, access to CURVES can be used to reduce energy and water consumption and costs of tenant services and maintenance, as well for security purposes (such as leak and smoke detections). EcoGuard products and systems are offered in Sweden, with sales primarily made to customers in the residential renovation sector, as well as to residential building owners that have Fidelix systems in place. In 2019, Fidelix acquired a 40% stake in Lansen Sytems AB (“Lansen”), a Swedish manufacturer of wireless and battery driven connected indoor climate and security sensors. This has enhanced its sub-metering and wireless solution capabilities, as well as provided Fidelix with access to the smart-home market in Sweden and Finland. Lansen products are expected to be sold through EcoGuard and Fidelix and to other European IMD specialists.",,as_expected,2020,384,
1629,Final Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.12,Fidelix,9.12.2,Overview of Fidelix Financial Performance,"Fidelix has achieved solid financial performance in recent years. According to Fidelix’s management accounts, for the year ended September 30, 2020, Fidelix had reported net sales, net profit, EBITDA and EBITDA margin of €45.5 million, €2.3 million, €6.1 million and 13.4%, respectively. Growth in reported net sales since 2017 have been driven by both organic growth and acquisitions (including the acquisition of EcoGuard in April 2019). Although a one-off provision in 2018 relating to an accounting methodology adjustment caused reported EBITDA to decrease in 2018 (as compared to 2017), Fidelix’s successfully grew reported EBITDA in 2019 and 2020. Similarly, double-digit reported EBITDA margins have fluctuated between 2017 and 2020, with the one-off provision in 2018 and investments in personnel in 2020 depressing strong margins. Fidelix has demonstrated strong cash flow generative growth, with free cash flow and cash conversion of €5.6 million and 91.1%, respectively, for the year ended September 30, 2020. Fidelix’s operational model does not require significant capital expenditures, which amounted to €1.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2020 (according to Fidelix’s management accounts and excluding acquisition and financing related items accounted for in capital expenditures). Although Fidelix’s capital expenditures have increased since 2017, the majority of this increase relates to research and development projects, such as the development of a new operating platform and EcoGuard’s development projects. Net working capital changes vary depending on the working capital requirements of Fidelix’s BMS projects, which tend to tie up working capital given that a large portion of the payment is received at the completion of the project. According to Fidelix’s management accounts, Fidelix’s net working capital was €3.6 million as of September 30, 2020 (representing a negative net working capital change of €0.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2020).",,as_expected,2020,384,
1629,Final Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.12,Fidelix,9.12.3,Rationale for Fidelix Acquisition,"Fidelix’s business strengthens and complements our offering and accelerates our development journey. The Fidelix Acquisition provides us with a market-leading position within the building automation market. This fits directly in our strategy to organize according to technical disciplines with potential cross-sales synergies. Moreover, the addition of a critical mass in BMS technical competence supports our long-term position. It also provides a platform for further acquisition-led growth, especially given Fidelix’s track-record of successful bolt-on acquisitions that have complemented its organic growth. 13 ----- We believe Fidelix will be accretive to us in light of the increased exposure to an attractive part of the resilient installation market given Fidelix’s digitalization capabilities. In particular, we expect the Fidelix Acquisition will provide a further platform for growth by increasing our exposure to a growing technical discipline, which addresses certain key sustainability areas for businesses that we expect to be integrated in many future projects, with a focus on areas such as energy efficiency, digitalization and health, and which is also backed by the regulatory emphasis on increased sustainability. Fidelix will also add to our overall market presence in Finland, enabling our overall Finnish operation to reach a critical mass. Fidelix’s operations are also expected to enhance our overall margin profile by adding a relatively high-margin business to the Group. Fidelix has a strong track record of double-digit margins. Its large and growing installed base, which includes an installed base of approximately 11,000 in residential buildings in Sweden through Fidelix’s EcoGuard products, further profitability through its aftermarket and cloud businesses, including through CURVES, the cloud-based IoT platform. We believe that Fidelix’s recent positive financial performance can continue in the near-term, particularly given its strong market position and focus on renovation projects. Fidelix’s solid free cash flow conversion driven by relatively low capital expenditure requirements and focus on net working capital efficiency is also consistent with the Group’s operations. Fidelix also offers a diversified customer base, with exposure to different project sizes, including renovation and public sector projects. This diversification is expected to increase further over time given Fidelix’s IMD services. The Fidelix Acquisition also brings additional digitalization capabilities across the Group, which we expect to be a driver as we focus on the next-generation of installation across all of our business areas. We also believe that there is a strong cultural fit with Fidelix’s management given their focus on technical competence and similar decentralized philosophy. For example, Fidelix’s in-house research and development team has developed and introduced multiple successful technologies over the years. Likewise, our lean and tested support functions will allow Fidelix to improve in terms of reporting and internal control in a more rapid and cost efficient manner.",,as_expected,2020,384,

These companies have a total of over 270 employees and estimated aggregated annual revenue of over SEK 450 million. These acquisitions were made through share and asset purchases for an aggregate cash consideration of approximately SEK 310 million, of which SEK 300 million has been paid as of the date hereof and SEK 10 million will be payable at a later date under the terms of the relevant acquisition agreements.

Estimated net revenue growth from acquisitions was offset by negative organic growth, which was primarily attributable to the closure of a number of unprofitable units in late 2019, in combination with enhanced production in several major projects during that time. Despite stable estimated net revenue, we estimate that Adjusted EBITA will increase, as compared to Adjusted EBITA of SEK 516 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and for Adjusted EBITA Margin to improve as compared to the Adjusted EBITA Margin of 5.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019, driven by measures to enhance profitability that were taken in late 2019 through our accelerated profitability program, in combination with profitable acquisitions.

The financial information for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily representative of our results of operations, cash flows or financial position for any future period at any future date, is not prepared in the ordinary course of our financial reporting. (2) Excludes the impact of IFRS 16 on the combined financial information as of and for the relevant period. (3) EBITA, Adjusted EBITA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and other ratios derived therefrom are non-IFRS measures. We define EBITA as profit for the year/period before tax, net financial items and amortization of intangible assets. We define Adjusted EBITA as EBITA before items affecting comparability (including impairment of rights-of-use assets), which are categorized as acquisition, integration and start-up costs, restructuring costs, transformation costs and other items affecting comparability, as described under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of _Operations—Items Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations.” We define Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITA before_ depreciation of property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets, and after certain lease accounting adjustments to exclude the impact of IFRS 16 on the combined financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 and the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2020. We define Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted to reflect the pro forma EBITDA contribution of the Fidelix Acquisition, certain other acquisitions that were not consolidated for the full twelve months ended September 30, 2020 and operational cost savings initiatives that were completed by December 31, 2019. Investors should not consider 30 ----- EBITA, Adjusted EBITA, Adjusted EBITDA or Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (a) as an alternative to operating profit/(loss) as a measure of our operating performance, (b) as an alternative to cashflow from operating and investment activities as a measure of our ability to meet cash needs or (c) as an alternative to any other measure of performance under IFRS. EBITA, Adjusted EBITA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as presented in this offering memorandum may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in the way these measures are calculated. See “Presentation of Financial and _Other Information—Presentation of Financial Information—Non-IFRS Measures.” Investors should also note that EBITA, Adjusted_ EBITA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as presented above are calculated differently from “Consolidated EBITDA” as defined and used in the Indenture. See “Description of Notes—Certain Definitions” for a definition of “Consolidated EBITDA” in the Indenture. The following is a reconciliation of profit to EBITA, Adjusted EBITA, Adjusted EBITDA and to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented:",,as_expected,2020,384,

The combined financial information represents the group of entities that became the legal Assemblin Financing Group at the end of 2019. From January 1, 2019, we apply IFRS 16 Leases which has an impact on our reported statements of profit or loss, financial position and presentation of cash flow. In implementing IFRS 16, we selected the modified retrospective approach as the transition method As a result, the Unaudited Condensed Interim Financial Statements and the 2019 financial information contained in the Audited Combined Financial Statements are prepared after implementing IFRS 16, and the 2018 and 2017 financial information contained in the Audited Combined Financial Statements is prepared prior to the implementation of IFRS 16. The comparison figures for 2018 and earlier periods have not been restated, and are thus not directly comparable where there are differences caused by the implementation of IFRS 16. See Note 1 to the Audited Combined Financial Statements. The unaudited condensed statement of comprehensive income information and the other financial information presented for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 have been derived by subtracting from the financial information of the audited combined financial statements as of December 31, 2019 the comparative financial information of the unaudited condensed interim financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, and adding the financial information of the unaudited condensed interim financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The unaudited condensed statement of comprehensive income information and the other financial information presented for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 have been prepared for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily representative of our results of operations for any future period or our financial condition at any future date. In particular, the unaudited financial information for the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2020 is not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ended December 31, 2020 and should not be used as the basis for or prediction of an annualized calculation. This data has been prepared solely for the purpose of this offering memorandum, is not prepared in the ordinary course of our financial reporting. The unaudited as adjusted and pro forma combined financial information presented in this section has been prepared to illustrate the effect of the Transactions and certain other adjustments on certain combined financial information as of and for the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2020. The information, which has been produced for illustrative purposes only, by its nature addresses a hypothetical situation and, therefore, does not represent the Group’s actual financial position or results, nor do they purport to project our financial position at any future date or our results of operations for any future period. The actual results may differ significantly from those reflected in the as adjusted and pro forma combined financial information for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, differences in assumptions used to prepare the as adjusted and pro forma combined financial information. The Group’s combined financial information and other data should be read in conjunction with the information contained in “Use _of_ _Proceeds,”_ “Capitalization,” “Selected _Consolidated_ _and_ _Combined_ _Financial _Information,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and_ the Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. 26 -----",,as_expected,2020,384,
1629,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business and Industry Our business may be adversely affected by difficult economic conditions and other factors beyond our control,13.1.1,,"Our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the Nordic, European and global economies. The demand for some of our services tends to be cyclical and can be significantly lower in an economic environment characterized by lower household income and corporate earnings, lower levels of government and business spending and slowdowns in the construction industry. Demand for our services depends in particular on spending in residential and commercial construction in the Nordic region as well as renovation and maintenance in industrial and infrastructure markets in that region, and a prolonged period of slow growth or economic contraction may reduce demand for our services. The level of activity in these end-markets depends on a variety of factors that we cannot control, including: Š local, regional and global economic conditions, slowdowns and recessions; Š the policies of the countries in which we operate, including the policies of the central banks of Sweden, Norway and Finland; Š the policies of transnational institutions, such as the European Central Bank and other institutions of the European Union, which influence the performance of national economies in countries in which we operate; and Š the level of demand in construction and in manufacturing and process industries, demographic trends, capital spending and consumer confidence. Unfavorable developments with respect to any or all of these or other factors can have a material impact on the demand for the services that we offer, both in terms of decreased volumes and price levels. One of our market drivers is activity in the new construction market, which is sensitive to general business and economic conditions both regionally and worldwide, including the availability of credit, interest rates, inflation, fluctuations in capital, the credit and mortgage markets, changes in tax laws affecting the real estate industry, unemployment levels, and business and consumer confidence. The demand for some of our services is cyclical to the construction market. We provide the majority of our services to the renovation and maintenance and related services markets, which have historically been more resilient to macroeconomic changes and can tend to be countercyclical. Private residential spend, as well as other sectors of the installation market, can be affected by high mortgage delinquency and foreclosure rates and limitations in the availability of home improvement financing, which may limit consumers’ spending during economic downturns, particularly on discretionary items, and affect their confidence level, leading to continued reduced spending on home improvement projects. The impact of these economic factors specific to the renovation and maintenance market may be further exacerbated by unemployment levels. As a result, adverse developments in global financial markets and general business and economic conditions, including economic recessions, downturns or negative developments or general weakness in the economies of the Nordic countries could adversely affect demand for our products and services, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. 36 ----- In particular, the outlook for the world economy remains subject to uncertainty, particularly in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may lead to prolonged periods of economic uncertainty in the Nordic, European and global economies. The International Monetary Fund predicts negative global growth in 2020 and many national governments have instituted rescue policies intended to prevent a financial recession. A renewed or future recession could reduce the demand for our services, particularly due to any reduced spending in residential and commercial construction in the Nordic region as well as renovation and maintenance in industrial and infrastructure markets in that region. Moreover, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or other similar pandemics or adverse public health developments, our operations and those of our customers, subcontractors and suppliers, may experience delays, disruptions and other adverse effects, such as suspension or reduction of operations, declines in sales activities, difficulties in travel and communications, and regulatory restrictions, any of which could have a material adverse impact on us as a result of, for example, a further reduction in demand for our services, delays and uncertainties in project timelines, deteriorations in the ability of our customers and subcontractors to serve their contractual obligations due to liquidity constraints or other financial difficulties. Although schemes have been initiated by national governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate to provide financial support to parts of the economy most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the actual impact on our customers, subcontractors and suppliers and, therefore, the impact on us, remain uncertain at this stage. See “—A change in supplier rebates due to the loss of our leading market position or other market conditions or _a deterioration in our commercial relationship with one or more key suppliers could adversely affect our income and gross margins” and “—Our operations could be adversely affected if a significant number of our customers terminate their services contracts prior to the end of the contractual term or select another provider following the expiration of their contracts.” Moreover, although governmental authorities in most of the countries in which_ we operate have loosened restrictions as compared to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, many restrictions have remained in place and a significant number of these governmental authorities have re-imposed restrictions (or may impose new restrictions) in response to an increasing number of COVID-19 cases. It is not possible to predict the end of the pandemic or how long the restrictions may remain in place as a precaution even once the pandemic has ended. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or on our ability to service or otherwise make payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness. Furthermore, in our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have utilized certain generallyavailable governmental support measures in conjunction with the temporary suspension or part time work of a portion of our employees. Although the amounts received to date have not been significant, should we require additional significant support, any government action relating to funds received by the Group under such governmental support measures, including demands for repayment, could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the Group.",,as_expected,2020,384,
1629,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,We may not be able to successfully manage future growth,13.2.1,,"Our ability to manage our growth and integrate operations, technologies, services and personnel depends on our administrative, financial and operational controls and our ability to create the infrastructure necessary to exploit market opportunities for our services, as well as our financial resources. In order to compete effectively and to grow our business profitably, we will need, on a timely basis, to maintain and improve our financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures, implement new systems as necessary, attract and retain adequate management personnel, and hire, retain and train a highly qualified workforce. Furthermore, we expect that as we continue to introduce new services and enter new markets, we will be required to manage an increasing number of relationships with various customers and other third parties. This would typically require us to attract, train and retain increasing numbers of highly skilled technical personnel and branch managers. The failure or delay of our management in responding to these challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and result of operations.",,as_expected,2020,384,
1629,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.3,We operate in highly competitive markets,13.3.1,,"The market for installation and services is highly competitive. There are currently a large number of small, local companies and a smaller number of relatively large regional, national and multinational companies operating in our markets. We also expect that new competitors may develop over time as smaller enterprises become more established and reliable and refine their service capabilities. Competition varies depending on business area, customer classification and geographic area. The principal competitive factors in our business include the following: Š the availability and cost of materials and supplies; Š technical product knowledge and expertise as to application and usage; 37 ----- Š consulting and other service capabilities; Š the ability to build and maintain customer relationships; Š the effective use of technology to identify net revenue and operational opportunities; Š same-day delivery capabilities for certain services; and Š the pricing of services and the provision of credit. Some of our current or future competitors may have greater resources or lower price discipline than we do, and may use this advantage to further increase their market share. Competitors may also engage in aggressive pricing tactics, which may lead to us having to reduce our prices in order to compete with them. For example, since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been subject to increased competition on smaller projects due to increased price competition from local companies. Furthermore, we may expend significant time and resources in order to prepare a bid or participate in a bidding process, at the end of which we may not be retained. Even if we are awarded a contract, it may not yield the expected results. As a result of high competition, therefore, we may not be able to maintain our competitive position in the markets in which we operate and our net revenue, profitability and market shares may decline, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the nature of the markets in which we compete may attract new entrants, particularly from countries with low-cost employment. Although we consider this risk to be relatively limited, in part, due to significant levels of unionization and professional qualification requirements for workforce engaged in the installation and services industry, competition with service providers that benefit from lower cost structures may challenge our competitive position. Furthermore, in recent years, new construction methods have led to the introduction of a range of new low-cost installation solutions. For example, as low-cost prefabricated housing construction becomes more common, the demand for prefabricated building and housing components with pre-built low-cost installations may increase, which may have an adverse impact on the demand for our services. If we are unable to respond to these shifts in demand, our sales may decline, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.",,as_expected,2020,384,
1629,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.4,The Nordic Building Services Market has low barriers to entry at the local branch level and we may face a loss of market share or a decrease in margins from increased price competition in certain local markets,13.4.1,,"The market for installation and services is highly fragmented, with low barriers to entry at the local level. Our local branches compete with a large number of relatively small local installers and service providers, some of whom benefit from operating efficiencies or lower overhead costs than us, which enables them to offer lower prices than we do. This has in the past and may continue to result in a high degree of competition at the local or regional level in the Nordic Building Services Market. Increased industry competition could result in increased price competition, lower profit margins, a decline in our market share and greater competition for qualified personnel. If we were to face such competition, our net revenue, profitability and market shares may decline, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",,as_expected,2020,384,
1629,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.5,"Our competitors continue to consolidate, which could cause the markets in which we operate to become more competitive and could negatively impact our business",13.5.1,,"There has been an increase in consolidation activity among our competitors in the markets in which we operate. This consolidation is being driven primarily by customer need and supplier capabilities, which could cause our markets to become more competitive as greater economies of scale are achieved by our competitors. Customers are increasingly aware of the total costs of not having access to consistent sources of supply at multiple locations. While we believe these customer needs could result in fewer numbers of competitors in the market as our remaining competitors become larger and capable of supplying their services on a more consistent and comprehensive basis, these consolidated competitors may increase competition along the value chain. We may fail to effectively participate in the industry consolidation for a variety of reasons, including antitrust restrictions, which may limit the degree to which a large market participant such as us can acquire additional competitors, as well as our substantial indebtedness, and we may not have the resources to compete for such acquisitions. In addition, industry consolidation could make it more difficult for us to maintain operating margins and could also increase competition for our acquisition targets and result in higher purchase price multiples. We may also face increased difficulty in growing and maintaining our market share and increasing our growth prospects. 38 -----",,as_expected,2020,384,
1629,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.6,"Our growth strategy involves acquisitions, and we may experience difficulties identifying acquisition targets, integrating acquired businesses and achieving anticipated synergies",13.6.1,,"Growth through acquisitions is one of our key growth strategies. We regularly identify and evaluate acquisition opportunities. For example, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we have acquired businesses in Sweden across several business areas, including one in Electrical, three in Heating and Sanitation and three in Ventilation. Since October 1, 2020, we have completed the acquisitions of an additional thirteen companies in Sweden, Norway and Finland and across each of our business areas, including four in Electrical, four in Heating and Sanitation, three in Finland and one in each of Norway and Ventilation. See “Management’s Discussion and _Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations— Acquisitions.” We also expect to complete the Fidelix Acquisition with part of the proceeds from the Offering._ See “Summary—The Transactions—The Fidelix Acquisition.” We may enter into binding agreements to acquire additional businesses that we expect to complement or augment our existing operations. There can be no assurance, however, that suitable acquisition targets will be identified in the future, or that we will be able to finance such acquisitions on favorable terms. Furthermore, acquisitions we have already made or future acquisitions may not be integrated successfully into our operations and may not achieve desired financial objectives. Any acquisitions of businesses entail numerous operational and financial risks, including: Š higher than expected acquisition and integration costs; Š the possibility that we could pay more than the acquired company or its assets are worth; Š the possibility that we may not identify appropriate acquisition targets, complete future acquisitions on satisfactory terms or realize expected synergies or cost savings within expected timelines; Š unforeseen expenses, delays or conditions may be imposed upon the acquisition, including due to required regulatory approvals or consents; Š exposure to unknown liabilities; Š difficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of acquired businesses with our existing operations and personnel; Š diversion of management’s attention from our day-to-day business; Š impairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers of acquired businesses due to changes in management and ownership and the restructuring of logistics and information technology systems; Š the inability to retain key employees of acquired businesses; Š difficulty avoiding labor disruptions in connection with any integration, particularly in connection with any headcount reduction; and Š the incurrence of substantial debt. The occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. See also, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Fidelix Acquisition.” In addition, there can be no assurance that, following integration into our Group, an acquired operation will be able to maintain its customer base consistent with expectations or generate the expected margins or cash flow. Although we analyze each acquisition target, our assessments are subject to a number of assumptions concerning profitability, growth, interest rates and company valuations. We may have difficulties in implementing our business model within an acquired company due to various factors, including conflicting corporate culture. There can be no assurance that our assessments of and assumptions regarding acquisition targets will prove to be correct and actual developments may differ significantly from our expectations. In agreeing to acquire entities, we generally make certain assumptions and determinations on, among other things, future net revenue and earnings, based on our investigation of the respective businesses and other information then available. We cannot assure you that our assumptions and determinations will prove to be correct or that liabilities, contingencies or other risks previously not known to us will not arise. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to acquire companies depending on the concentration of ownership in specific markets and our relative market position. Any such unanticipated risks, liabilities, contingencies, losses or issues, if realized, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, acquisitions of companies expose us to the risk of unforeseen obligations with respect to employees, customers, suppliers and subcontractors of acquired businesses, public authorities and other parties. We cannot ensure that there will not be unexpected risks or obligations. Such obligations, were they to materialize, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 39 -----",,as_expected,2020,384,
1629,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.7,Anticipated pro forma adjustments to our financial information may not materialize as anticipated,13.7.1,,"We present certain information herein on the basis of certain estimates and assumptions to present for the twelve months ended September 31, 2020 management’s estimate of, among other things, (i) the pro forma full twelvemonth impact of the Fidelix Acquisition, as if such acquisition had completed on October 1, 2019 (based on Fidelix’s historical EBITDA derived from its management accounts, as adjusted for certain non-recurring items and the estimated pro forma effect of an acquisition by Fidelix and the application of consistent accounting policies) and (ii) the pro forma full twelve-month impact of certain acquisitions that were completed prior to and after September 30, 2020, in each case, as if such acquisitions had completed on October 1, 2019 (based on each target’s historical EBITDA derived from its management accounts, as adjusted for its actual contribution to our results of operations since the date of its acquisition and as further adjusted in a manner consistent with our presentation of financial information to the extent applicable and the application of our accounting policies and other items). See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations— _Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Acquisitions.”_ Each of the adjustments is based on our current estimates, and involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any anticipated future results. None of the pro forma financial data and underlying assumptions has been audited, reviewed or verified by an independent accounting firm or other third party. The adjustments and assumptions used in preparing these metrics may prove to be inaccurate or may be affected by other factors that have not been accounted for, including if any of the risks set out in these ‘‘Risk Factors’’ are magnified. As such, they should not be considered in isolation or be used as a substitute for an analysis of the operating results of our Group and no undue reliance should be made in respect of such information. Any failure to realize the anticipated pro forma adjustments to financial information could materially and adversely affect our business, result of operations and financial condition.",,as_expected,2020,384,
1629,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.8,"Our success depends on effective project and site management, which could be impaired by a certain number of factors",13.8.1,,"For many of our projects, we provide a broad range of services with a high technical content. For example, in our Assemblin EL segment, we install complex electrical infrastructure in hospitals and other commercial buildings and in our service business area, we provide maintenance and periodic repair of these installations, for which a high level of technical skill is required. In order to ensure that the projects we take on are effectively conducted and profitable, we need to have a high degree of project and site management expertise, especially in evaluating the costs of providing our services to the relevant customer and in maximizing efficiency in providing the contracted services throughout the term of the contract. Specific factors that can affect our performance and profitability include our ability to accurately determine the costs of providing the contracted services in the context of a particular project, our ability to measure the personnel and other resources that we need to deploy in order to fulfil our contractual obligations on an ongoing basis, our ability to control services provided by subcontractors or to influence the performance of such subcontractors or other service providers, and unforeseen technical difficulties that could cause project delays or unscheduled project downtime. The challenges related to project management could be magnified by the growth of our business, as we may be unable to staff each project with suitably qualified personnel. See “—Our success is highly dependent on the ability to recruit and retain _technical and other key personnel.” Moreover, our ability to effectively manage our projects or deliver our_ services may be affected by factors beyond our control. For example, although these effects have not been significant to our financial results, since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced delays in several installation projects due to the closing of construction sites. Moreover, due to relatively more stringent lockdown measures in the second quarter of 2020, we were unable to deliver our services to certain customers. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors _Affecting Our Results of Operations—General Economic Conditions and Activity in the Installation Market.”_ If, due to ineffective contract planning or management or otherwise, we are unable to efficiently and profitably render our services, we could experience increased contract execution costs, difficulty in obtaining timely payment for our services or harm to our reputation, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.",,as_expected,2020,384,
1629,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.9,"We bear the risk of cost overruns in many of our projects and, as a result, we may experience reduced profits or, in some cases, losses under these projects if the cost increases are above our estimated amounts",13.9.1,,"We base our prices for our fixed-price contracts largely upon estimates and assumptions of projected costs. The timetable of execution and/or cost structure of our projects can differ from bid estimates because both depend on 40 ----- a wide range of parameters, some of which are difficult to forecast at the beginning of a project, such as the accessibility of the work site, the availability of qualified personnel, adverse weather conditions and increases in the prices of petroleum or raw materials used in the materials we purchase for installation in our customers’ sites (for example, copper with respect to cables) which we may not be able to pass on through re-invoicing to our customers. If our estimates or assumptions prove to be inaccurate, circumstances change in a way that renders our assumptions and estimates inaccurate, or if unexpected complexities in project execution arise, we may incur costs higher than those that we estimated, cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits or a loss for affected projects. For example, in the first quarter of 2019, we have experienced cost overruns on some of our projects in Norway, which have negatively affected our Norway segment’s performance and margins during that period. We also are exposed to increases in energy prices and prices for raw materials that we may be unable to pass on to our customers. Additionally, in certain circumstances, we guarantee project completion or the achievement of certain acceptance and performance testing levels by a scheduled date, as well as provide warranties to our customers for a certain period (generally five years) after project completion. Although we seek to procure performance guarantees for our projects from insurance companies and banks for up to 10% of the project’s value, a failure to meet schedule or performance requirements typically results in additional costs to us, and, in some cases, it may create liability for consequential and liquidated damages. In certain circumstances, some providers of performance guarantees may determine we are no longer qualified to receive such guarantees, in which case, we would need to find alternative providers. Performance problems for existing and future projects could cause our actual results of operations to differ materially from those we anticipate and could damage our reputation within our industry and our customer base.",,as_expected,2020,384,
1629,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.10,Our success is highly dependent on the ability to recruit and retain technical and other key personnel,13.10.1,,"Our future success depends on our ability to continue to identify, attract, train, retain and motivate a sufficient number of highly skilled technical personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense. We may be unable to successfully attract, assimilate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel. Failure to do so could harm our business and growth, and ultimately our profitability. In particular, it may be difficult to find qualified personnel in regions that are experiencing a growth in demand for the services that we provide, such as in Stockholm, Oslo and Helsinki. In addition, our continued success depends largely on our ability to retain our technical and key personnel. The departure of significant numbers of our highly skilled personnel could impair our ability to execute our business plan and growth strategy, cause a loss of customers, reduce revenues and adversely affect employee morale. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain or attract an adequately skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our business strategy or that labor expenses will not increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of these skilled personnel. In addition, our activities require a wide range of continually evolving skills in order to keep up with changes in the sectors in which we operate. We may be unable to find qualified candidates, train staff in new methods, and recruit and train managers. We may also face decreased access to qualified labor due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related government mandated lockdowns due to closure of borders and decreased labor mobility. For example, our operations in Norway and Finland during the second quarter of 2020 were adversely affected by such restrictions due to the impediments on our ability to use subcontractors from outside such countries. Moreover, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced increased sick leave, which may adversely affect our operations, particularly our services business for which we rely on the technical skills and institutional knowledge of our existing employees that cannot be readily replaced with subcontractors. We may also incur significant costs in maintaining employee health and safety requirements and, as our operations expand, we may face increased work accidents and illness (both in frequency and severity). The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased sick leave among our staff and a need to increase health and safety measures throughout our operations. In addition, during periods of rapid economic growth, we may encounter problems in recruiting and retaining qualified employees, as well as experience increased staff costs during these periods, or a decrease in the quality of the services we provide, all of which could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.",,as_expected,2020,384,
1629,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.11,"A majority of our balance sheet assets consist of intangible assets, which are subject to impairment testing and may affect future results of operations",13.11.1,,"Our intangible assets are substantial and represented SEK 2,790 million as of September 30, 2020. Our intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill. 41 ----- We capitalize goodwill relating to acquisitions, which is calculated as the difference between the historical cost and fair value of an acquired business and the fair value of our share of the acquired business’s identifiable net assets at the time of acquisition. Goodwill from the acquisition of operations is recognized as an intangible asset. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment testing at least annually. The identification and measurement of impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units. Accounting for impairment contains uncertainty because management must use judgment in determining appropriate assumptions to be used in the measurement of fair value. The estimates of fair value of reporting units are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment and incorporate management assumptions about expected future cash flows and contemplate other valuation techniques. For more information see our financial statements included in this offering memorandum. An adverse development in our business activities may require us to recognize impairment charges to write off all or a part of the carrying amount of our goodwill and other intangible assets. If an expense or impairment loss must be recognized, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There is significant judgement required in the analysis of a potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets. The future development of the macroeconomic environment, of the COVID-19 pandemic, unsuccessful acquisitions or other factors could lead to possibly significant impairments to be recognized in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

We are dependent upon the services of our employees and their respective local customer relationships, as well as on the skills and expertise of our employees in particular projects or particular markets. We may not be able to retain such employees in the future, and such employees could leave us for competitors or form competing businesses themselves. Despite our decentralized model, we also depend upon the services of our management. Any inability to attract or retain an adequate number of qualified branch managers, project managers, key executive officers or other skilled employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, while we believe decentralization is a key element of our business model and an important element for the implementation of our strategy, decentralization necessarily places significant control and decisionmaking powers in the hands of local project and branch managers. There is a risk that those local managers will not comply with our internal policies or processes or that we will not successfully implement future compliance policies, update existing control procedures and compliance policies and maintain efficient reliable IT systems required to effectively monitor our operations.

Our historical success is attributable, in large part, to our reputation as a leading and reliable provider of a broad range of services, particularly services requiring a certain level of technical expertise, and this reputation has strengthened our business and helped to facilitate our expansion. Although we closely monitor the quality of our services, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to protect our business against damage to our reputation vis-à-vis our customers, potential customers and, more generally, in the geographic regions and business sectors in which we operate. Any damage to our reputation or brand as a result of adverse litigation, breach of procurement laws or regulations, third-party challenges to contracts won in public procurement procedures, failure to meet contract deadlines or specialized performance requirements, or for any other reason, could have a material adverse effect on our marketing and ability to obtain projects from customers, as well as our business, results of operations and financial condition.",,as_expected,2020,384,

The success and profitability of our public sector business may be influenced by political considerations. It may also be affected by political and administrative decisions concerning levels of public spending. In certain cases, due to applicable regulations, such as European Union tender rules, certain terms of public sector contracts, such as pricing terms, contract period, the use of subcontractors and the ability to transfer receivables under contract, could result in less flexibility than comparable private sector contracts. Public sector contracts can, if entered into or prolonged in violation of applicable tender rules, be declared invalid by a court of law, or if questioned by a third party competitor, risk being terminated by the public sector customer. Certain of our public sector contracts may be subject to challenge on these grounds and could be declared invalid if they are found to be in violation of applicable public procurement law. 43 ----- Moreover, decisions to decrease public spending may result in the termination, delay or downscaling of public sector contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Historically, our performance has been linked, in part, to the ability and willingness of local, regional and national governments to allocate public funds to infrastructure and other publicly funded projects, as well as our ability to bid successfully for these contracts. Public sector spending, in turn, generally has been dependent on long-term general macroeconomic conditions. A decrease in public sector spending as a result of a deterioration in Nordic, European or global economic conditions, changes in governmental policy or other reasons, including the COVID-19 pandemic, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. There is a risk that a fall in public sector spending in the countries in which we operate will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation. Contracts in the public sector are also subject to review and monitoring by local authorities to ensure compliance with laws and regulations prohibiting anti-competitive practices. Although we believe that we comply with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not be found in violation of any such laws or regulations, and we could be subject to fines, penalties and other sanctions, including exclusion from participation in tenders for public contracts.

Furthermore, if a public sector entity were to violate applicable procurement laws or regulations in connection with contracts entered into with us or our marketing activities, the relevant authorities or a competitor could seek enforcement action against us. Any such violation, even if prohibited by our policies, could result in civil or criminal penalties, the loss of business or harm to our reputation and, accordingly, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, awards under public procurement processes may be subject to challenge or rescission based on actual or alleged procedural deficiencies in the tender process, even after we have made significant expenditures associated with winning such an award.

Some of our competitors may be willing to offer a lower price than us, reduce staff costs, accept lower profit margins or expend more in capital to obtain or retain customers. As a result, we may not be successful in winning awards on commercially attractive terms over our competitors. In addition, competitive bidding results in substantial costs and presents a number of risks, including: substantial investments in terms of cost and managerial time required to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may or may not be awarded to us; the need to estimate accurately the resources and costs that will be required to service any contracts we are awarded, often in advance of the final determination of their full scope; the expense and delay that may arise if our competitors protest or challenge awards made to us pursuant to a competitive bidding process, and the risk that such protest or challenge could result in the requirement to resubmit bids or in the termination, reduction or modification of the contracts that have been awarded; and the opportunity cost of not bidding on and winning other contracts we might otherwise pursued, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",,as_expected,2020,384,

Interest rate changes, for example, affect demand for residential and non-residential structures, which in turn affects sales of our services that serve these activities. Interest rate changes also affect our customers’ ability to finance purchases and can impact the ability of our suppliers to finance the production of parts and components necessary to deliver the services we sell. In addition to changing interest rates, central banks and other policy arms of many countries take actions to vary the amount of liquidity and credit available to such country. During the COVID-19 pandemic, governments globally have stepped up monetary and fiscal policies to fight the economic effects of lockdowns and containment measures. Such measures have served to stabilize conditions in the short term to various degrees but may need to be unwound in the future.

We are not always able to quickly or effectively react to price increases by our suppliers or pass through increased costs to our customers. A majority of our contracts allow us to pass through cost increases to our customers. However, short-term changes in the costs of raw materials, some of which are subject to significant fluctuations, are not always passed on to our customers, and we do not currently enter into forward sales, commodity, derivative or hedging arrangements to establish a price in advance for the purchase of future raw materials. Any delay in our ability to pass on material price increases to our customers could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, if prices decrease for commodities, we may have inventories purchased at prices higher than prevailing market prices. Prices and the availability of petroleum products are subject to political, economic and market factors that are outside our control. Political events in petroleum-producing regions as well as weatherrelated events may cause the price of fuel to increase. Any significant increases in fuel or energy prices or increased costs relating to emissions control requirements that have been or may be imposed in the future, particularly due to climate change-related legislation, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

However, we retain responsibility for the work performed by these subcontractors. Accordingly, we are exposed to risks relating to managing subcontractors and the risk that these subcontractors may fail to perform the agreed-upon services satisfactorily and on a timely basis, which could affect our ability to perform our obligations (which could lead to contractual monetary penalties) or meet our customers’ expectations and comply with applicable regulatory requirements. In extreme cases, performance or other deficiencies on the part of our subcontractors could result in a customer terminating our contract. A termination could expose us to financial liabilities, damage our reputation and impair our ability to compete for future contracts. In addition, in the event a subcontractor provides unsatisfactory services on our behalf, we could be required to make additional investments or provide additional services to ensure the adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services. In addition, we are exposed to the operational controls of our subcontractors, including with respect to the qualifications of their personnel and their compliance with labor and immigration laws. Our subcontractors may maintain inadequate insurance coverage or inadequate financial resources to honor claims resulting from damages or losses inflicted by such subcontractors on our customers. We constantly manage and monitor the performance of our subcontractors. However, the failure of subcontractors to meet their contractual obligations or comply with applicable laws or regulations could harm our reputation, as well as result in customer losses and financial liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Similarly, much of our business, particularly with respect to installation in new construction projects, derives from our strategic partnerships with leading Scandinavian construction companies that hire us as subcontractors. 45 ----- In our contracts with these construction companies, we often agree, along with all other subcontractors on the project, to have joint and several liability for the performance of the construction company’s obligations under the supply contract.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, we estimate that our top ten suppliers accounted for 33% of our total supply costs. We may not be able to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers that can satisfy our standards for quality and price and our need to access products and supplies in a timely and efficient manner. We may be required to replace a supplier if its products do not meet our quality, price or safety standards. Our results of operations and inventory levels could suffer if we are unable to promptly replace a supplier that is unwilling or unable to satisfy our requirements with a supplier providing similar products. The loss of, or substantial decrease in the availability of, products from our suppliers, or the loss of a key supplier, could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, supply interruptions could arise from shortages of raw materials, labor disputes or weather conditions affecting products or shipments, transportation disruptions or other factors beyond our control, including closures related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Short-term and long-term disruptions in our supply chain would result in a need to maintain higher inventory levels as we replace similar products, a higher cost of goods and ultimately a decrease in our net revenue and profitability. A disruption in the timely availability of our goods by our key suppliers and the failure by our suppliers to continue to supply us with products on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, may result in a decline of our operating margins and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. The cost of our services have historically been volatile and subject to fluctuations arising from changes in supply and demand, economic conditions, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulation and trade policies, as well as from periodic delays in the delivery of our products. We have a limited ability to control the timing and amount of changes to prices that we will pay for our products. In addition, the supply of our products fluctuates based on available manufacturing capacity. A shortage of capacity, or excess capacity, in the industry can result in significant increases or decreases in market prices for those products, often within a short period of time. Even where we are able to increase our prices to our customers, we may be unable to increase our prices in sufficient time to absorb price increases by our suppliers.

For example, we were part of an installation group that was hired by building contractor Skanska to conduct the planning and design of the installation work for the new health care building in the Malmö hospital area in 2015. Recently in September 2019, Skanska entrusted the same installation group with the implementation phase of that project, an assignment that is worth approximately SEK 1,669 million in total and of which we will be responsible for SEK 1,067 million. Our opportunities to partner with these types of construction companies could be adversely affected if: we are unable to achieve the objectives under our arrangements in a timely manner, or at all; our partners become unable, unwilling or less willing to invest in new property development due to poor general market conditions, their financial condition or other circumstances, many of which are beyond our control; we disagree with a key partner regarding strategic direction, the economics of our relationship or other matters; we are unable to successfully manage multiple simultaneous projects with such partners; our strategic partners breach or terminate their contract with us; our partners become competitors of ours or enter into agreements with our competitors; 46 ----- applicable laws and regulations, domestic or foreign, impede our ability to enter into strategic arrangements; or as we enter into additional or consolidation in the construction markets limits the number of potential industry partners. If any of these events occur, or if we fail to maintain our agreements with our strategic partners and collaborators, we may not be able to further develop our business or generate sufficient revenues to support our operations. Additionally, our business could be negatively impacted if any of our industry partners undergo a change of control, assign the rights or obligations under any of our agreements or cease to be a going concern. We may be exposed to the credit risk of certain of our customers and, in addition, our liability to customers under guarantee provisions may materially and adversely affect our earnings. We sell installation and services solutions to our customers through contracts that are not secured by collateral or other security and therefore bear the risk that our customers will be unable to pay amounts due to us. Our products are sold to customers in industries that may experience fluctuations in demand based on economic conditions, energy prices, seasonality, consumer demand and other factors beyond our control. These industries include the construction industry. We may not be able to limit our potential loss of revenues if a significant number of customers are unable to pay amounts due to us on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. At the same time, we generally provide guarantees for completed projects as to the proper operation and conformance to specifications of our installations and services. The failure of our installations to operate properly or to meet specifications may increase our costs by requiring additional engineering resources and services, the replacement of parts and equipment or monetary reimbursement to a customer.

These rebates effectively reduce our costs. Our ability to earn and negotiate rebates is critical to the success of our business. If market conditions change or if we lose our leading market position, suppliers may respond by changing the terms of some or all of these purchasing programs to our detriment. Any such changes could lower our gross margins or revenues. Furthermore, a loss of market share could result in a decreased demand for our services, which could cause our volume requirements for certain products to decline. If we are unable to meet specified volume thresholds for certain suppliers, we may not receive favorable rebates, which could increase our costs and decrease our gross margins. In addition, some of our suppliers are not obligated under long-term supply agreements to continue to sell to us. We have relatively few sources of supply for some of the products that we purchase, and in some cases we rely on a small group of suppliers for certain key products. In addition, the lead time involved in the manufacturing of some of these components can be lengthy. If certain of our key suppliers become unwilling or unable to supply us with components meeting our requirements, we may not be able to organize additional or replacement suppliers in a timely manner, or at all. Moreover, we maintain low levels of inventory and our suppliers deliver directly to our work sites, which prevents us from being able to provide replacement supplies on our own should one or more or our suppliers fail to meet our supply requirements.

Although our backlog only includes expected sales under committed contracts with customers, there can be no assurance that these contractual terms would not change, and that the backlog will result in an actual recognition of revenue within the period initially anticipated, if at all. In addition, certain contracts included in our estimated order backlog may not be profitable. We may experience variances in the realization of our estimated order backlog because of project delays or cancellations resulting from weather conditions, project deferrals or delays, scope adjustments, external market factors and economic factors beyond our control. If our estimated order backlog fails to materialize as we anticipated, our business, financial condition or results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. Accordingly, our estimated order backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of future revenue or earnings. Our order backlog does not provide a precise indication of the time period over which we are contractually entitled to receive such revenue and there is no assurance that such revenues will be actually received by us in the time frames anticipated, or at all. Our order backlog is computed based on facts known and assumptions deemed appropriate at the computation date. Although under our unilateral termination rights relating to defined termination events, our order backlog is based on the full contractual period, as we estimate that, based on our operating history and course of dealing with our customers, these contracts are more likely than not to reach their full term and be continued for the duration of their option periods. Unforeseen events or circumstances, including, for example, the termination or scaling down of service contracts, may affect the backlog and could negatively impact our earnings and financial position. There can be no assurance that the revenue projected in our order backlog will be realized or, if realized, that it will result in profits. Because of contract terminations or suspensions and changes in contract scope and schedule, we cannot predict with certainty when, or if, our order backlog will be achieved. We can provide no assurance that we will not receive additional terminations, and, even where a contract proceeds as scheduled, it is possible that the customer may default and fail to pay amounts owed by it, including due to customer bankruptcies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise. To the extent we are unable to realize the pipeline of revenue associated with contracts in our backlog due to material delays, terminations or payment defaults, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected.

As such, claims involving customers, suppliers and subcontractors may be brought against us, and by us, in connection with our contracts or with customers’ internal procedures. Claims brought against us could include back charges for alleged defective or incomplete work, breaches of warranty and/or late completion of the project and claims for cancelled projects. The claims and back charges can involve actual damages, as well as contractually agreed-upon liquidated sums. These claims, as well as claims we may make against customers or other third parties, if not resolved through negotiation, could result in lengthy and expensive litigation or arbitration proceedings. We occasionally bring claims against project owners for additional costs that exceed the contract price or for amounts not included in the original contract price, including change orders. These types of claims occur due to matters such as owner-caused delays, increased unit prices or changes from the initial project scope that result, both directly and indirectly, in additional costs. Often, these claims can be the subject of lengthy arbitration, litigation or third-party expert proceedings, and it can be difficult to accurately predict when these claims will be fully resolved. When these types of events occur and unresolved claims are pending, we may invest significant working capital in projects to cover cost overruns pending the resolution of the relevant claims.

The projections and assumptions made by our risk management team at the time when such transactions were entered into could prove to be incorrect and the transactions could fail to limit the risks as intended or increase our costs. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we intend to hedge some or all of our interest rate and currency risk under the Notes since the majority of our revenues are paid in currency other than euros, which is the currency of the Notes. Such hedges are senior obligations of the Issuer and rank pari passu in right of payment with the Notes and obligations under the Super Senior Facilities, and together with the Notes, the Super Senior Facilities are secured by first-priority security interests over the Collateral; provided, however, that, under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, certain hedges are “super senior” in terms of the receipt of the proceeds of enforcement of Collateral until such super senior hedges and obligations under the Super Senior Facilities have been repaid in full. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements— _Intercreditor Agreement.” If we were to default in making payments under the Notes, or if certain other credit_ events were to occur in relation to us and a credit-linked hedge of interest rate or currency risk in respect of such Notes were to terminate or be closed out as a result, then, in relation to the mark-to-market (“MTM”) value which would normally be payable by one party to the other on a termination or close-out of an equivalent hedge that was not credit-linked, either (a) we will be limited, where such MTM value would otherwise be payable to us, in claiming against our hedge counterparty in respect of such termination or close-out to an amount equal to the product of (i) such MTM value and (ii) the credit recovery rate for holders of the Notes, such credit recovery rate being determined within a reasonable period after such termination or close-out by reference to a market auction process or market quotations for such notes, or (b) no MTM payment in respect of such termination or close-out will be due from either party, depending on the particular type of credit-linked hedge into which we enter.",,as_expected,2020,384,
1629,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.34,We are exposed to translation risk of currency fluctuations,13.34.1,,"Our business operations are characterized by a relatively low level of transactional currency risk since our purchases and sales are made in the same local currency with minimal exposure to imported components. From an accounting perspective, we are exposed to risks relating to translation into Swedish kronor of income statements and balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries with local reporting denominated in euro (in the case of operations in Finland) and Norwegian kroner. In order to prepare our combined financial statements, we must translate foreign currency assets, liabilities, net revenue and expenses into Swedish kronor. For balance sheet items, foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates applicable on the transaction date. For income statement items, foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the average exchange rate applicable to the period. Consequently, increases and decreases in the value of the Swedish krona against other currencies affect the amount of these items in our combined financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. A 5% strengthening of the euro as of December 31, 2019 would have had a positive translation effect on equity of SEK 3.4 million and the same increase in value of the Norwegian krone would have had a positive translation effect on equity of SEK 2.8 million. 50 -----",,as_expected,2020,384,

Over the past several years, our business has benefited from increased levels of the outsourcing of installation and services activities by public institutions and private companies. The development of outsourced services may be affected by political decisions, public opinion, positive and negative experiences with outsourcing, and demand by public institutions and private users.

Although weather patterns affect our results of operations throughout the year, cold and wet weather during the winter months has historically reduced construction activity primarily in the first quarter in our markets. In contrast, our highest volume of net revenue historically has occurred in September through November. Generally, during the winter months, new construction activity declines due to inclement weather and to the holiday season. Public holidays and vacation, particularly in the months of June and July, also have seasonality effects, because building projects or industrial production processes may slow or temporarily cease. As a result, our results of operations may vary significantly from period to period. We anticipate that fluctuations from period to period will continue in the future. In addition, cold weather is less favorable for construction projects and delays installation work because it hinders site accessibility. Adverse weather conditions, particularly during the winter season, could affect the ability of our employees to perform efficient work outdoors in certain regions of Sweden, Finland, and Norway.

Changes in tax laws could adversely affect our tax position, including our effective tax rate or tax payments. In addition, Swedish, Finnish, Norwegian and European and other international tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and are subject to varying interpretations. We often rely on generally available interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We cannot be certain that the relevant tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretation of these laws. If our tax positions are challenged by relevant tax authorities, the imposition of additional taxes could require us to pay taxes that we currently do not collect or pay or increase the costs of our services to track and collect such taxes, which could increase our costs of operations and have a negative effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. For example, Swedish and Norwegian tax authorities challenged the deductibility of interest on our shareholder loans, and while discussions with tax authorities continue, we have taken appropriate provisions for our tax positions in our results of operations, which are reflected through an increase in tax for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018 in our Audited Combined Financial Statements.",,as_expected,2020,384,

We may not be able to develop and implement, on a timely basis, projects, systems, procedures and controls required to support the growth and development of our operations. If we are unable to manage our growth and improve our performance, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. We rely on information technology systems that allow us to track and bill our services, communicate with our customers, manage our employees and gather information upon which our management makes decisions regarding our business. The administration of our business is increasingly dependent on the use of these systems. As a result, system failures or disruptions resulting from disasters, computer viruses, hackers or other causes could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, pursuant to contracts with third-party vendors, we outsource the operation and maintenance of certain of our information technology systems to seek to ensure effective management of our information technology resources, as well as to improve the cost efficiency of our information technology infrastructure, systems and applications.

Other employees have pensions that are recognized as defined-contribution. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 30% of our employees had defined benefit pensions. Of these, the Swedish plan for electricity white-collar employees is unfunded and based on final salary, which provides employees with benefits in the form of a guaranteed level of pension disbursements over their lifetimes and is recognized as defined benefit for purposes of our financial statements. For the remaining white-collar employees in Sweden the defined-benefit pension obligations are secured through insurance with Alecta and are accounted for as a defined contribution plan. Pension scheme liabilities vary with changes to long-term interest rates, inflation, pensionable salaries and the longevity of scheme members. Our liabilities in respect of provisions for pensions increased from SEK 483 million as of December 31, 2017, to SEK 560 million as of December 31, 2018, to SEK 703 million as of December 31, 2019 before decreasing slightly to SEK 690 million as of September 30, 2020, which was driven primarily by a decline in market interest rates, which resulted in the assumed discount rate for definedbenefit obligations decreasing from 2.40% as of December 31, 2018 to 1.40% at December 31, 2019 to 1.30% at September 30, 2020. The increase in liabilities in respect of provisions for pensions also reflects the relatively greater proportion of plan participants that are not eligible for retirement, as compared to the number of former plan participants that have retired. Changes to local legislation and regulations relating to defined benefit plan funding requirements may also result in significant deviations in the timing and size of the expected cash contributions under such plans. For example, in the year ended December 31, 2019, actuarial losses and financial commitments related to pensions liability amounted to SEK 90 million. Increases in our pensions liability could adversely affect our financial condition. In accordance with the requirements of the pension administrator, we are required to provide bank guarantees in respect of a portion of the Group’s defined-benefit pensions obligations. We have been required to increase the amount of our current SEK 240 million bank guarantee (incurred under the Pension Guarantee Facility) by SEK 45 million, which additional amount was initially incurred under the Guarantee Facility. We expect to ultimately incur the full SEK 285 million under the Pension Guarantee Facility once we have increased the SEK 240 million of aggregate commitments thereunder by SEK 45 million, as permitted under the terms of the Pension Guarantee Facility Agreement to reflect increased guarantee requirements by the pension administrator (and to cancel the amount initially incurred under the Guarantee Facility). Our obligations with respect to the Pension Guarantee 52 ----- Facility and the Guarantee Facility are secured on the Collateral on a super senior basis to the Notes. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—The Super Senior Facilities.” Availability of the additional guarantee amounts under the Pension Guarantee Facility or the Guarantee Facility, however, is subject to certain conditions, including compliance with certain financial covenants. Moreover, lenders under the Pension Guarantee Facility may not be able to increase the size of their commitments thereunder in time to satisfy the deadline set by the pension administrator or at all. If the Swedish pensions regulatory authority requires us to provide bank guarantees of our pensions liabilities or increase the size of our pre-existing bank guarantees in excess of the amounts that are available to us, this may result in additional financial obligations being imposed on us by the regulator, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.",,as_expected,2020,384,

We may encounter strikes or other disturbances, or threats of strikes or disturbances occasioned by our unionized labor force and, upon the expiration of existing collective bargaining agreements, we may be unable to reach new collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or without work stoppages, strikes or similar industrial actions. Our inability to negotiate satisfactory terms for new agreements would likely cause our labor costs to increase, which would negatively affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass the additional costs on to our customers. When we acquire companies and integrate them into our existing operations, we frequently enter into negotiations to restructure or reduce the workforce at the acquired company. We may experience lengthier consultations or even strikes, work stoppages or other industrial actions in the future, particularly when we are engaged in restructuring and reducing our workforce.

Additionally, in accordance with local laws, the Security Agent and/or the Trustee may not be able to represent the holders of the Additional Notes in a court process without a specific power of attorney. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note _Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_ Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance and other laws, a court could subordinate or void the Note Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral granted by the relevant Security Documents and, if payment had already been made under a Note Guarantee or upon enforcement of the Collateral, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant Guarantor, if the court found that: Š the relevant Note Guarantee or security interest under the Security Documents was incurred with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or security provider or, in certain jurisdictions, even when the recipient was simply aware that the Guarantor or security provider was insolvent when it granted the relevant Note Guarantee or security; Š the Guarantor or security provider did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for the relevant Note Guarantee or security interest under a Security Document and the Guarantor or security 55 ----- provider was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Note Guarantee or security interest; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Note Guarantee or security interest; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; Š the relevant Note Guarantees or Security Documents were held to exceed the corporate objective of the Guarantor or security provider or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor or security provider; or Š the amount paid or payable under the relevant Note Guarantee or the enforcement proceeds under the relevant Security Documents was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law. The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon applicable governing law. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness: Š the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, is greater than the fair value of all its assets; Š the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay the probable liability on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become due; or Š it cannot pay its debts as they become due. If a court were to find that the issuance of the Notes or a Note Guarantee was a fraudulent conveyance or held it unenforceable for any other reason, the court could hold that the payment obligations under the Notes or such Guarantee are ineffective, or require the holders of the Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the Notes or such Note Guarantee. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent conveyance occurred, you may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of the other Guarantors under any Note Guarantees that have not been declared void. Additionally, any future pledge of Collateral in favor of the Security Agent, including pursuant to Security Documents delivered after the date of the Indenture, might be avoidable by the security provider (as debtor-in-possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy (or similar officer) if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the security provider is insolvent at the time of the pledge, the pledge permits the holders of the Additional Notes to receive a greater recovery than if the pledge had not been given and a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the security provider is commenced within three months following the pledge, or in certain circumstances, a longer period. In order to receive the benefit of a security interest, the secured creditors must hold secured claims (in other words, the secured party and the creditor have to be the same person). In addition, under the terms of the Indenture, we are permitted in the future to incur additional indebtedness and other obligations that may share in the liens on the Collateral securing the Additional Notes and the liens on the collateral securing our other secured debt. The granting of new security interests may require the releasing and retaking of security or otherwise create new hardening periods in certain jurisdictions. The applicable hardening period for these new security interests will run from the moment each new security interest has been granted or perfected.

1629,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.53,Risks Related to Our Financial Profile Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations may make it difficult for us to fulfil our obligations under the Notes and operate our business,13.53.1,,"We have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness with significant debt service requirements. After giving effect to the Transactions (excluding the Fidelix Acquisition, but including the Offering and the use of proceeds thereof), our total financial indebtedness (including the Temporary Notes) would have been SEK 4,459 million (or approximately €384 million) as of September 30, 2020. Our significant leverage could have important consequences for holders of the Notes, including, but not limited to: Š making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our other debt and liabilities; Š requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our debt instead of operations, thus reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund internal growth through working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures, product research and development, and other general corporate purposes; Š increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, a downturn in our business, or generally adverse economic or industry conditions; Š placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged as us; Š limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive environment and industry; Š restricting us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or exploiting certain business opportunities; Š limiting, among other things, our and our subsidiaries’ ability to borrow additional funds, including with respect to financial leases on which we rely for replacement and expansion of our vehicle fleet, or raise equity capital in the future and increasing the costs of such additional financings; 57 ----- Š exposing us to risks that are inherent in interest rate fluctuations because certain of our indebtedness (including the Notes) bears variable rates of interest; and Š subjecting us to restrictive covenants, including, in the case of our Super Senior Facilities, financial covenants, the non-compliance with which could result in an event of default under, or acceleration of, our indebtedness. In addition, over the next three years, additional variable cash consideration of up to approximately SEK 160 million may be payable in connection with acquisitions we have undertaken as of the date hereof. We primarily expect to use cash flow from operations and borrowings under our Super Senior Facilities to finance our operations, service our indebtedness and fund capital expenditures. Our ability to make these payments depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors, many of which we cannot control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, which could result in us being unable to service or repay indebtedness or fund other liquidity needs. If we cannot service our indebtedness and meet our other obligations and commitments, we might be required to refinance our debt or dispose of assets to obtain funds for such purpose. We cannot assure you that such refinancings or asset disposals could be effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all, or would be permitted by the terms of our debt instruments.",,as_expected,2020,384,

Although the Temporary Indenture, the Indenture and the Super Senior Facilities Agreement contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness (including secured indebtedness) that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Following this Offering, we expect to have SEK 640 million immediately available for borrowing under our Revolving Credit Facility, and SEK 200 million under our Guarantee Facility. Under the Temporary Indenture and the Indenture, in addition to specified permitted debt, we can incur additional indebtedness so long as on a pro forma basis our fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Temporary Indenture and Indenture) is at least 2.0 to 1.0 and additional indebtedness sharing in the Collateral securing the Additional Notes so long as on a pro forma basis our consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio (as calculated in accordance with the “Description _of the Notes”) is no greater than 4.3x to 1.0. In addition, neither the Temporary Indenture, the Indenture nor the_ agreement governing our Super Senior Facilities prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements. Moreover, some of the debt we may incur in the future could be effectively and structurally senior to the Notes and may be secured by collateral that does not secure the Notes. The incurrence of additional debt would increase the leverage-related risks described in this offering memorandum. If we are able to designate some of our restricted subsidiaries under the Temporary Indenture and the Indenture as unrestricted subsidiaries, those unrestricted subsidiaries would be permitted to borrow beyond the limitations specified in the Temporary Indenture and the Indenture and engage in other activities in which restricted subsidiaries may not engage. We are also permitted to invest in joint ventures and acquisitions, which may increase our indebtedness. Moreover, although the Temporary Indenture, the Indenture and the agreement governing our Super Senior Facilities contain restrictions on our ability to make restricted payments, including the declaration and payment of dividends, we are able to make substantial restricted payments under certain circumstances. Under the Temporary Indenture and the Indenture, for example, we are able to make dividends, distributions, loans or other payments to any Parent (as defined therein) so long as on a pro forma basis our specified consolidated total net leverage ratio (as calculated in accordance with the “Description of the Notes”) does not exceed 3.0 to 1.0 on a net basis. Adding new debt to our and our subsidiaries’ existing debt levels or making restricted payments could exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage described above, including our possible inability to service our debt.",,as_expected,2020,384,
1629,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.55,"We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, including due to factors outside our control, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful",13.55.1,,"Our ability to service our indebtedness will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors. Some of these factors are 58 ----- beyond our control. In addition, our ability to borrow funds in the future to make payments on our debt will depend on the satisfaction of the covenants in our debt agreements, including the Temporary Indenture and the Indenture, and other agreements we may enter into in the future. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make interest and principal payments on our debt, including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. If our cash flows from operations and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital, forego opportunities, or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not be sufficient to enable us to meet our scheduled debt obligations. In the absence of such cash flows and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be required to sell material assets to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those asset sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices and on terms that we believe are fair, and any proceeds that we receive may not be adequate to meet any debt obligations then due. If we cannot meet our debt obligations, the holders of our debt may accelerate our debt and, to the extent such debt is secured, foreclose on our assets securing such debt. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay all of our debt. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest or principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness.

Each of the covenants is subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of _Certain Financing Arrangements—The Super Senior Facilities” and “Description of the Senior Secured Notes— Certain Covenants.” Despite these exceptions and qualifications, the covenants contained in the Temporary_ Indenture, the Indenture and the agreement governing our Super Senior Facilities could materially affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to react to market conditions, raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns, take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise or grow in accordance with our strategy. For example, such restrictions could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, make strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances, restructure our organization or finance our capital needs. Additionally, our Super Senior Facilities Agreement requires us to maintain a senior secured net leverage ratio, which must not exceed 7.2x to 1.0, tested quarterly, and our ability to meet that financial ratio can be affected by 59 ----- events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. A breach of any of those covenants or restrictions could result in an event of default under the agreement governing the Super Senior Facilities, and the relevant lenders, subject to applicable cure periods and other limitations on acceleration or enforcement, could cancel the availability of the Super Senior Facilities and elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, a default under the agreement governing the Super Senior Facilities could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, including the Temporary Indenture and the Indenture. If our creditors, including the lenders under the Super Senior Facilities, accelerate the payment of those amounts, we cannot assure you that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, and to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries which would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the Notes, in full or in part. In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts.",,as_expected,2020,384,

In addition, the Temporary Indenture and the Indenture permit us to incur additional indebtedness, which may bear a floating rate of interest. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future. To the extent that interest rates or any drawings were to increase significantly our interest expense would correspondingly increase, reducing our cash flow. Although we may enter into certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will be available or continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. Further, there may be a mismatch between the successor rates applied in respect of the Group’s floating rate debt and the successor rates applied in respect of hedging arrangements thereon, which may render such hedging arrangements ineffective in managing the Group’s interest rate risks.",,as_expected,2020,384,
1629,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.58,"Uncertainty relating to the calculation of EURIBOR or LIBOR or a discontinuance of such rates or any regulatory reform affecting such rates may materially adversely affect the value of and return on our floating rate debt, including the Notes",13.58.1,,"Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, a measure of interbank lending rates, regulators and law enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union are conducting investigations into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily EURIBOR or the calculation of LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate EURIBOR and LIBOR. In addition, LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” are the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, which entered into force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. For example, on July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021 (the “FCA Announcement”). The FCA Announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. The potential elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or LIBOR is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark. Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest. 60 ----- The Temporary Indenture and the Indenture provide a mechanism whereby, if EURIBOR is no longer being calculated or administered, the Issuer could cause an independent financial advisor to determine an appropriate successor rate, and make certain adjustments to such rate, including applying a spread thereon to make such successor rate substantially comparable to EURIBOR, which upon certification by the Issuer to each of the Temporary Trustee, the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and the Paying Agent will be used to calculate the interest rate in relation to the Notes without any further action or consent by the Holders or the Trustee or the Temporary Trustee. This would mean that interest on the Notes would be determined on the basis of a benchmark rate, together with adjustments, that was not contemplated at the time you purchased the Notes. In addition, due to the uncertainty concerning the availability of an appropriate successor rate and the involvement of an independent financial advisor, the Temporary Indenture’s or the Indenture’s successor rate mechanism may not operate as intended at the relevant time. Any elimination of the EURIBOR benchmark, or changes in the manner of administration of EURIBOR, could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions of our floating rate debt. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on the value of and return on any such floating rate debt. If EURIBOR were discontinued or otherwise unavailable, the rate of interest on our floating rate debt will be determined for the relevant period by the fallback provisions applicable to such debt.",,as_expected,2020,384,

Furthermore, the Original Notes and the Additional Notes and the Notes Guarantees are or will be secured on a first-priority basis by the same Collateral securing the obligations under the Super Senior Facilities. In addition, under the terms of the Temporary Indenture and the Indenture, we are permitted to incur significant additional indebtedness and other obligations that may be secured by the same Collateral on a pari _passu basis with the Notes and, in certain circumstances, receive proceeds from enforcement of Collateral prior_ to the Notes.

Such security interests are, or will be, evidenced by security documents for the benefit of (whether directly or through the Security Agent) the holders of the Additional Notes, the lenders under the Super Senior Facilities and/or the holders of certain other future indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the Temporary Indenture and the Indenture. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, subject to certain conditions, in the event of acceleration of the Super Senior Facilities, the Additional Notes or other secured obligations, amounts recovered in respect of the Collateral, will be required to repay indebtedness in respect of the Super Senior Facilities, including obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Guarantee Facility and the Pension Guarantee Facility, as well as certain Hedging Obligations, certain future indebtedness and hedging obligations (if any) in priority to the Additional Notes, following the payment of fees and expenses of the agent under the Super Senior Facilities, the Trustee and the Security Agent (and any receiver or delegate) and any fees and expenses of any other creditor representative of future indebtedness permitted under the terms of the Temporary Indenture and the Indenture to benefit from such security interests. As a result, proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may be insufficient to pay claims under the Additional Notes. In addition, claims of our secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also secure the Additional Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Additional Notes. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that a common security agent, who will serve as the Security Agent for the secured parties with respect to the Collateral, will act only as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement.

In addition, under the terms of the Temporary Indenture and the Indenture, we are permitted to incur significant additional indebtedness and other obligations that may be secured by the same Collateral. Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, a common security agent will serve as the Security Agent for the secured parties under the Super Senior Facilities, the Original Notes, the Additional Notes and the hedging arrangements (if any), respectively, with regard to the shared Collateral (as applicable). The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent will, subject to certain limited exceptions, act to enforce the security interests in the Collateral and take instructions from the relevant secured creditors in respect of the Collateral only at the direction of an “instructing group.” Generally, if there are conflicting enforcement instructions received by the Security Agent from the different classes of creditors which are secured by the Collateral and who can constitute either “majority super super senior creditors” (generally lenders under the Pension Guarantee Facility and any additional Pension Guarantee Facility whose credit participations represent more than 66 2/3% of the aggregate credit participations of all Pension Guarantee Facility lenders), “majority super senior creditors” (generally, creditors representing 50.1% of the aggregate of all unpaid and undrawn commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Guarantee Facility (or any replacement thereof) and the termination value or assumed termination value of certain future “super priority” hedging obligations, if any) or “majority senior secured creditors” (generally, creditors representing the majority of the outstanding principal amount under the Original Notes and the Additional Notes, any pari passu secured indebtedness and the termination value or assumed termination value of certain future hedging obligations which are not given “super priority” status, if any), as the case may be, the representatives of the creditors sharing in the Collateral are required to first consult in good faith with each other (in each case, including the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Original Notes and the Additional Notes, the agent on behalf of lenders under the Pension Guarantee Facility (or any replacement thereof) and the agent on behalf of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility (or any replacement thereof) and the Security Agent, for a period of 15 days (or such shorter period as may be agreed) with a view to coordinating the instructions to be given by an instructing group and agreeing an enforcement strategy (a “joint enforcement strategy”). Upon conclusion of this “consultation period,” if the relevant creditor representatives are unable to agree on a joint enforcement strategy or if conflicting enforcement instructions are received by the Security Agent from the different classes of creditors which are secured by the Collateral and who can constitute an instructing group, and provided that the “security enforcement principles” set out in the Intercreditor Agreement have been complied with, then the majority senior secured creditors shall constitute an instructing group and shall have the right to instruct the Security Agent as to the enforcement of the Collateral. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no consultation period shall be required if either (i) any of the Collateral becomes enforceable because of an insolvency event in respect of the Issuer, Midco or certain members of the Group, (ii) the majority super super senior creditors, majority super senior creditors or the majority senior secured creditors determine in good faith that entering into consultation could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any of the Collateral or to reduce the amount likely to be realized upon enforcement of the Collateral to a level such that the obligations to the “super senior creditors” would not be discharged in full, or (iii) the relevant creditor representatives are in agreement as to any proposed enforcement action, in which case, the Security Agent shall act in accordance with the instructions provided by the majority senior secured creditors (provided that such instructions are consistent with the security enforcement principles set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement). 62 ----- Generally, if the Security Agent is obliged to follow the enforcement instructions of the majority senior secured creditors as discussed above and either (i) the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility (or any replacement thereof) (together with any “super priority” hedging obligations) have not been repaid in full in cash within six months of the end of the consultation period, (ii) the Security Agent has not commenced any enforcement action (or any transaction in lieu) in respect of the relevant Collateral within three months of the end of the consultation period or (iii) an insolvency event has occurred in respect of the Issuer or certain members of the Group and the Security Agent has not commenced enforcement (or any transaction in lieu) of the relevant Collateral or taken any other enforcement action at that time, then, the Security Agent shall, provided that the security enforcement principles set out in the Intercreditor Agreement have been complied with, instead follow the instructions that are given by the majority super senior creditors (and the terms of the relevant previous enforcement instructions of the majority senior secured creditors which conflict with the instructions of the majority super senior creditors shall be deemed revoked). Further, generally, if the Security Agent is obliged to follow the enforcement instructions of the majority super senior creditors or the majority senior secured creditors as discussed above and either (i) the lenders under the Pension Guarantee Facility (or any replacement thereof) have not been repaid in full in cash within twelve months of the end of the consultation period, (ii) the Security Agent has not commenced any enforcement action (or any transaction in lieu) in respect of the relevant Collateral within nine months of the end of the consultation period or (iii) an insolvency event has occurred in respect of the Issuer or certain members of the Group and the Security Agent has not commenced enforcement (or any transaction in lieu) of the relevant Collateral or taken any other enforcement action at that time, then, the Security Agent shall, provided that the security enforcement principles set out in the Intercreditor Agreement have been complied with, instead follow the instructions that are given by the majority super super senior creditors (and the terms of the relevant previous enforcement instructions of the majority senior secured creditors or majority super senior secured creditors which conflict with the instructions of the majority super senior creditors shall be deemed revoked). The foregoing security enforcement arrangements could be disadvantageous to the holders of the Additional Notes in a number of respects. Disputes may occur between the holders of the Additional Notes and creditors under our Super Senior Facilities (under any of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Guarantee Facility and the Pension Guarantee Facility), counterparties to certain hedging arrangements, if any, and/or holders of any permitted pari passu secured indebtedness as to the appropriate manner of pursuing enforcement remedies and strategies with respect to the Collateral securing such obligations. In such an event, the holders of the Additional Notes will be bound by any decisions of the relevant instructing group, which may result in enforcement action in respect of the relevant Collateral, whether or not such action is approved by the holders of the Additional Notes or may be adverse to such holders of Additional Notes. The creditors under the Super Senior Facilities (under any of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Guarantee Facility and the Pension Guarantee Facility), counterparties to certain hedging arrangements, if any, or the holders of any permitted pari passu secured indebtedness may have interests that are different from the interest of holders of the Additional Notes and they may elect to pursue their remedies under the relevant Security Documents at a time when it would otherwise be disadvantageous for the holders of the Additional Notes to do so. Other creditors not party to the Intercreditor Agreement could commence enforcement action against the Issuer or one or more of the Issuer’s subsidiaries during the consultation period or the Issuer or one or more of the Issuer’s subsidiaries could seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws, or the value of certain Collateral could otherwise be impaired or reduced in value. In addition, if we incur substantial additional indebtedness which may be secured on the Collateral, the holders of the Additional Notes may not comprise the requisite majority senior secured creditors for the purposes of instructing the Security Agent. Further, if the super senior creditors have not been repaid in full within six months of the end of the consultation period or in the event of the occurrence of certain other circumstances described above, then control of the enforcement proceedings will shift to the majority super senior creditors and if the super super senior creditors have not been repaid in full within twelve months of the end of the consultation period or in the event of the occurrence of certain other circumstances described above, then control of the enforcement proceedings will shift to the majority super super senior creditors. The holders of the Additional Notes will also have no separate right to enforce the Collateral securing the Additional Notes. In addition, the holders of the Additional Notes will not be able to instruct the Security Agent, force a sale of Collateral or otherwise independently pursue the remedies of a secured creditor under the relevant Security Documents, unless they comprise an instructing group which is entitled to give such instructions, which, in turn, will depend on certain conditions and circumstances including those described above. 63 ----- In addition, if the Security Agent sells any of the Collateral as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Additional Notes and over any other assets securing the Additional Notes may be released.

1629,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.61,The Collateral may not be sufficient to secure the obligations under the Additional Notes,13.61.1,,"The Original Notes, the Additional Notes and the Notes Guarantees are or will be secured by first-priority security interests in the Collateral described in this offering memorandum, which Collateral also secures the obligations under the Super Senior Facilities, certain hedging obligations and may secure certain future obligations. The Revolving Credit Facility is part of the Super Senior Facilities which also include a SEK 200 million Guarantee Facility and a SEK 240 million Pension Guarantee Facility. We may increase the amounts available under Super Senior Facilities or incur additional super senior liabilities as a result of which the amount of indebtedness and obligations that will benefit from “super priority” first-priority security interests in the Collateral may be increased up to the amount permitted under the Temporary Indenture and the Indenture. The Temporary Indenture and the Indenture do not prohibit any increases to the amount of the Pension Guarantee Facility secured on the Collateral nor provide any cap in respect of such amount. For example, we have been required to increase the amount of our current SEK 240 million bank guarantee incurred under the Pension Guarantee Facility by SEK 45 million. Although we have initially incurred this additional amount of SEK 45 million under the Guarantee Facility, we expect to ultimately incur the full SEK 285 million under the Pension Guarantee Facility once we have increased the SEK 240 million of aggregate commitments thereunder by SEK 45 million, as permitted under the terms of the Pension Guarantee Facility Agreement to reflect increased guarantee requirements by the pension administrator (and to cancel the amount initially incurred under the Guarantee Facility). Thus any amount of Pension Guarantee Facility (or replacement facility utilized for the same purposes) will be secured in priority to the Additional Notes. The Collateral may also secure additional debt ranking pari passu with the Additional Notes to the extent permitted by the terms of the Temporary Indenture, the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The rights of the holders of the Additional Notes to the Collateral may therefore be diluted by any increase in the debt secured by first-priority liens on the Collateral. If there is an event of default on the Additional Notes, the holders of the Additional Notes will be secured only by the Collateral. There is no guarantee that the value of the Collateral will be sufficient to enable the Issuer to satisfy its obligations under the Additional Notes. The proceeds of any sale of the Collateral following an event of default with respect to the Additional Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy, and may be substantially less than, amounts due on the Additional Notes. The value of the Collateral is based on certain assumptions. The fair market value of the Collateral at any point in time may be subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, general economic conditions, industry conditions and similar factors. The amount to be received upon an enforcement of such Collateral will depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers, whether or not our business is sold as a going concern, the ability to readily liquidate the Collateral and the fair market value and condition of the Collateral. Furthermore, there may not be any buyer willing and able to purchase our business as a going concern, or willing to buy a significant portion of our assets in the event of an enforcement action. As a result, the book value of the Collateral should not be conclusively relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets following the occurrence of an event of default or enforcement event under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture or the Super Senior Facilities. All or a portion of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, we cannot assure you that there will be a market for the sale of the Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in our liquidation. In addition, the security granted over the shares of an entity may be of no value if that entity is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding. To the extent that liens, security interests and other rights granted to other parties encumber assets owned by the Issuer or the Guarantors, those parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to their liens, security interests or other rights that could adversely affect the value of that Collateral and the ability of the Security Agent, the Trustee or investors as holders of the Additional Notes to realize or enforce that Collateral. If the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Additional Notes and the Notes Guarantees, investors (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only an unsecured claim (if the relevant guarantee has not been released) against the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ remaining assets. Each of these factors or any challenge to the validity of the Collateral or the intercreditor arrangement governing our creditors’ rights could reduce the proceeds realized upon enforcement of the Collateral. 64 ----- In addition, the Collateral may not be liquid, and its value to other parties may be less than its value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that there will be a market for the pledged shares or other Collateral or, if such market does exist, that there will not be substantial delays in their liquidation. In addition, the value of this Collateral may fluctuate over time.",,as_expected,2020,384,
1629,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.62,The Collateral secures amounts under certain guarantee facilities which are more likely to become due in circumstances when an enforcement action may be taken,13.62.1,,"The Super Senior Facilities comprise the Revolving Credit Facility, the Guarantee Facility and the Pension Guarantee Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized by the drawing of cash advances, the issue of bank guarantees and documentary credits (including letters of credit and performance bonds) and by way of ancillary facilities. The Guarantee Facility may be utilized by the issue of letters of credits, bank guarantees and by way of ancillary facilities by way of guarantee facilities and the Pension Guarantee Facility may be utilized by the issue of bank guarantees and by way of ancillary facilities by way of pension guarantee facilities. The Pension Guarantee Facility is intended to provide a guarantee required by the Swedish pension regulatory authorities in respect of the Group’s defined benefit pensions obligations. In the ordinary course of business, amounts under the Guarantee Facility and the Pension Guarantee Facility are likely to operate in a contingent manner rather than requiring immediate repayment. However, in the types of circumstances where the Collateral may become enforceable, including upon a payment default or insolvency related default under the Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility, the Guarantee Facility or the Pension Guarantee Facility, these contingent claims are more likely to crystallize. This may occur, for instance, if contractual parties that have been provided guarantees under project contracts will call on their guarantees. This will mean that amounts under such facilities will become due and payable, and as discussed above, will recover the proceeds of Collateral in priority to the Additional Notes. As described above, if the Super Senior Facilities are not repaid in full in prescribed amounts of time as set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement, creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and Guarantee Facility as super senior creditors and / or creditors under the Pension Guarantee Facility as super super senior creditors will become the instructing group for enforcement of the security.",,as_expected,2020,384,

The security interests will be limited to the same extent as those under the Super Senior Facilities and otherwise as set forth under “Certain Insolvency _Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests,” which limitations could be significant. It should be noted that if a guarantee or a security interest_ granted by a Guarantor in certain jurisdictions is granted or perfected after the secured obligation arose, such guarantee or security interest may be subject to claw-back provisions under applicable local insolvency laws.",,as_expected,2020,384,

The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the Additional Notes, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the first-priority ranking of security interests with respect to the Additional Notes can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in the Collateral. For example, the enforcement of share pledges, whether by means of a public auction or a private sale, may be subject to certain specific requirements and the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third-party to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security 65 ----- Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.

The granting of shared security interests to secure future indebtedness or other obligations permitted to be secured on the Collateral may restart or reopen such hardening periods in particular, because the Indenture permits the release and retaking of security granted in favor of the Additional Notes in certain circumstances, including in connection with the incurrence of future indebtedness. The applicable hardening period for these new security interests can run from the moment each new security interest has been granted, perfected or recreated. Each time, if the security interest granted, perfected or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the Additional Notes would lose the benefit of the security interest. The same rights and risks also will apply with respect to future security interests granted in connection with the accession of further subsidiaries as additional Guarantors and the granting of security interests over their relevant assets and equity interests for the benefit of holders of the Additional Notes.

The liens on the Collateral securing the Additional Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Additional Notes if we fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens. Absent perfection, the holder of the security interest may have difficulty enforcing such holder’s rights in the Collateral with regard to third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Collateral and some security interests do not actually create the purported security interest if not properly perfected. In addition, a debtor may discharge its obligation by paying the security provider until, but not after, the debtor receives a notification of the existence of the security interest granted by the security provider in favor of the security taken over the claims the security taker (as creditor) has against the debtor. Finally, since the ranking of pledges is sometimes determined by the date on which they became enforceable against third parties, a security interest created on a later date over the same Collateral, but which came into force for third parties earlier (by way of registration in the appropriate register or by notification) may have priority. Neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent has any obligation or responsibility to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute collateral or the perfection of, or to take steps or actions to perfect or ensure the perfection of, any security interest in the Additional Notes against third parties.

The Indenture provides (along with the Intercreditor Agreement) that only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the Security Documents. As a consequence, holders of the Additional Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Additional Notes, except through 66 ----- the Trustee, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the Collateral. See “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and _Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests” for further information._ It is generally possible under Swedish law to grant security interests in favor of an agent acting on behalf of secured parties. However, to enable the Security Agent to enforce the security interests in the Collateral on behalf of the holders of the Additional Notes in a Swedish court, the Security Agent may need a specific power of attorney from each holder of the Additional Notes. It has not been established by judicial precedent or otherwise by law that a power of attorney or mandate of agency, including the appointment of an agent can be made irrevocable. Therefore, any powers of attorney or mandates of agency can be revoked and will terminate by operation of law and without notice at the bankruptcy or temporal demise of the party giving such powers.

Upon the Temporary Notes Exchange, some, but not all, of the members of the Group will guarantee the Additional Notes. As of and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, the Guarantors represented 90% of our net revenues, 88% of our EBITDA and over 100% of our assets (other than goodwill and shares in subsidiaries), in each case, calculated on a stand-alone basis without giving effect to intergroup eliminations. On an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions as of September 30, 2020, the subsidiaries of the Issuer that will not guarantee the Additional Notes would have had less than SEK 10 million outstanding financial indebtedness.

The Indenture provides that the Notes Guarantees, and the Indenture and the relevant Security Documents provide or will provide that the security interests, will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed, or otherwise, or in respect of which security interests may be granted, by the relevant Guarantor or grantor, as applicable, without rendering the relevant Notes Guarantee or security interest, as it relates to that Guarantor or grantor, voidable or otherwise ineffective or limited under applicable law. See “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes _Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_ In addition, enforcement of any of the Notes Guarantees against any Guarantor or security interests against any security provider will be subject to certain defenses available to Guarantors or security providers, as applicable, in the relevant jurisdiction. Although laws differ among these jurisdictions, these laws and defenses generally include those that relate to corporate purpose or benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, 68 ----- insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, financial assistance, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital maintenance, set-off, counter-claim and prescription (time bar) or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, a Guarantor or grantor of security interests may have no liability or decreased liability under its Notes Guarantee or security interest, as applicable, depending on the amount of its other obligations and applicable law. Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other laws, a court could (i) subordinate or void any Notes Guarantee or any security interest (ii) direct that the holders of the Additional Notes return any amounts paid under a Notes Guarantee or security interest to the relevant Guarantor or security provider, or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to you, typically if the court found that: Š the Notes Guarantee or security interest was granted with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or the security provider or, in certain jurisdictions, even when the recipient was merely aware that the Guarantor or the security provider was insolvent when it granted the relevant Notes Guarantee or security; Š the Guarantor or security provider did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for the granting of the Notes Guarantee and/or security interest and the Guarantor or security provider: (i) was insolvent or was rendered insolvent as a result of having granted the relevant Notes Guarantee or security interest; (ii) was under-capitalized or became under-capitalized because of the relevant Notes Guarantee or security interest; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; Š the granting of the relevant Notes Guarantee and/or security interest was held to constitute prohibited financial assistance; Š the granting of the relevant Notes Guarantee and/or security interest was held not to be in the best interests or not to be for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor or security provider or was held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or security provider; or Š the aggregate amounts paid or payable under the relevant Notes Guarantee or enforcement proceeds under the relevant security were in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law. These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee granted by any of our subsidiaries pursuant to the Indenture. The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon applicable governing law. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if: Š the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all its assets; Š the present fair value of its assets was less than the amount required to pay its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they became due; or Š it could not pay its debts as they became due. We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was “insolvent” at the relevant time or that, regardless of the method of the valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Notes Guarantee was issued, that payments to holders of the Additional Notes constituted preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds. The liability of each Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee, or security provider under the relevant Security Document, will be limited to the amount that will result in such Notes Guarantee or security interest not constituting a fraudulent preference or conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurances as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor or security provider. There is a possibility that the entire Notes Guarantee or security interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. If a court were to find that the issuance of the Additional Notes or a Notes Guarantee, or the granting of the security, was a fraudulent preference or conveyance or unenforceable for any other reason, the court could hold that the payment obligations under the Additional Notes or such Notes Guarantee or Security Document are ineffective, could void the security over the Collateral, or could require the holders of the relevant Additional 69 ----- Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the Additional Notes or such Notes Guarantee or any enforcement proceeds received from enforcement of the security. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent preference or conveyance occurred, you may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor or security provider and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer, any other Guarantor or security provider, if applicable, under any Notes Guarantees or Security Documents that have not been declared void. Additionally, any future pledge or charge of Collateral in favor of the Security Agent, including pursuant to Security Documents delivered after the date of the Indenture, might be avoidable by the security provider (as debtor-in-possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy (or similar officer) if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the security provider is insolvent at the time of the pledge or charge, the pledge or charge permits the holders of the Additional Notes to receive a greater recovery than if the pledge or charge had not been given and a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the security provider is commenced within a certain time period following the pledge or charge.",,as_expected,2020,384,

Moreover, the Issuer and the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Sweden and Norway and a third party security provider is located in Luxembourg. Therefore, in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in these and other applicable jurisdictions. The rights of the holders of the Notes under the Temporary Indenture or the Indenture, as applicable, will thus be subject to the laws of a number of jurisdictions, and it may be difficult to effectively enforce such rights in multiple bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar proceedings. Moreover, such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly for creditors and often result in substantial uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors’ rights. In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Issuer and the Guarantors may be materially different from, or in conflict with, one another, including creditors’ rights, priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceeding.

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of repurchase. If a Change of Control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the Super Senior Facilities, the Temporary Indenture, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other than existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A Change of Control may trigger a mandatory prepayment of the Super Senior Facilities and other indebtedness.

The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from its subsidiaries to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control, may be limited by our then existing financial resources.

We cannot assure you that our Group would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Temporary Indenture or the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Revolving Credit Facility.

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investment-grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. The trading market for the Notes may attract different investors and this may affect the extent to which the Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. As a result, there can be no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all. Although the Original Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and an application will be made to the Authority for the listing of and permission to deal in the Temporary Notes and the Additional Notes on the Official List of the Exchange, we cannot assure you that the Notes will become or remain listed, as applicable. Although no assurance can be made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of the admission to the Official List of the Exchange, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting (whether or not for an alternative admission to listing on another stock exchange) of the Notes from the Official List of the Exchange may have a material effect on a holder’s ability to resell the Notes in the secondary market. In addition, the Indenture allows us to issue additional Notes in the future, which could adversely impact the liquidity of the relevant Notes.",,as_expected,2020,384,
1629,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.78,United States civil liabilities may not be enforceable against us,13.78.1,,"The Issuer and the Guarantors are located in Sweden and Norway and all of our assets are located outside the United States. In addition, all of the members of our board and our officers reside outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us or such other persons residing outside the United States, or to enforce outside the United States judgments obtained against such persons in United States courts in any action. In addition, it may be difficult for investors to enforce, in original actions brought in courts in jurisdictions located outside the United States, rights predicated upon United States laws. See “Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.” Sweden and Norway currently do not have a treaty with the United States providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. This may give rise to difficulties in respect of the enforcement in Sweden and Norway of judgments obtained in the United States. In particular, a judgment entered against a company incorporated in Sweden in the courts of a state which is not a Member State (as defined in the Recast Brussels Regulation) or a Contracting State (as defined in the Lugano Convention), such as the United States, would not be recognized or enforceable in Sweden as a matter of law without a retrial. In addition, a Swedish court may choose to retry the dispute without regard to the previous judgment. See “Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.” Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time. One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The credit ratings address our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks in determining the likelihood that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed above and other factors that may affect the 72 ----- value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the relevant Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost, terms and conditions of our financings, and could adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.",,as_expected,2020,384,

In addition, by acceptance of delivery of any Notes, the holder thereof agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor accounts for which it has purchased the Notes that it shall not transfer the Notes in an aggregate principal account of less than €100,000.

If investors measure their investment returns by reference to a currency other than euro, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange-related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro relative to the currency by reference to which such investors measure the return on their investments. These changes may be due to economic, political and other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the euro against the currency by reference to which such investors measure the return on their investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which such investors measure the return on their investments.",,as_expected,2020,384,

In addition, the controlling shareholders have the power to elect a majority of our board of directors and appoint new officers and management and, therefore, effectively control many other major decisions regarding our operations.

The Financial Statements have been prepared as combined financial statements. The combined financial information has been prepared as combined financial statements in a way of illustrating financial information for a group of entities that are not a legal group but are ultimately owned by the same party. The combined financial information represents the group of entities that became the legal Assemblin Financing Group at the end of 2019. From January 1, 2019, we apply IFRS 16 Leases which has an impact on our reported statements of profit or loss, financial position and presentation of cash flow. In implementing IFRS 16, we selected the modified retrospective approach as the transition method. As a result, the Unaudited Condensed Interim Financial Statements and the 2019 financial information contained in the Audited Combined Financial Statements are prepared after implementing IFRS 16, and the 2018 and 2017 financial information contained in the Audited Combined Financial Statements is prepared prior to the implementation of IFRS 16. The comparison figures for 2018 and earlier periods have not been restated, and are thus not directly comparable where there are differences caused by the implementation of IFRS 16. See Note 1 to the Audited Combined Financial Statements. The unaudited condensed statement of comprehensive income information and the other financial information presented for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 have been derived by subtracting from the financial information of the audited combined financial statements as of December 31, 2019 the comparative financial information of the unaudited condensed interim financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, and adding the financial information of the unaudited condensed interim financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

1629,Final Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.1,Overview,17.1.1,,"We are one of the Nordic region’s leading providers of complete installation and service solutions, with our primary activities focusing on electrical engineering, heating and sanitation, ventilation and automation, as well as key competencies in data and telecom, industrial pipes, district heating, cooling, sprinklers, security and electrical workshop and field services. We hold a strong position in the growing installation market in the Nordic region (comprising Sweden, Norway and Finland), which are estimated at approximately SEK 98 billion, SEK 75 billion and SEK 59 billion, respectively, and have a combined approximate value of SEK 231 billion as of December 31, 2019, and in 2019, we had the second largest share of Sweden’s installation market by revenue according to Prognoscentret. Moreover, in December 2020, we entered into a sale and purchase agreement to acquire Fidelix, a technology-driven building automation service company, which is expected to provide us with a market-leading position within the building automation market in the Nordics. We provide installation and service assignments in various types of properties, industrial facilities and infrastructure projects for a diverse customer base consisting over 20,000 large and small customers, which include construction companies, the public sector, property owners and industrial companies. Our strong relationships with our customers have contributed to an order backlog of SEK 8,245 million and an LTM order intake of SEK 9,859 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2020, and we currently have over 3,000 ongoing projects. We take on primarily two types of assignments: contractor assignments and service assignments. The proportion of contractor assignments and service assignments represented 60% and 40%, respectively, of our net revenue for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020. Our operations are decentralized and governed based on a shared framework, clear allocation of roles and responsibilities and systematic monitoring. Our current operating organization is divided into five specific business areas: three in Sweden (Assemblin El, Assemblin VS and Assemblin Ventilation), one in Norway (Assemblin Norway) and one in Finland (Assemblin Finland), comprising over 166 branches across over 100 locations with over 5,800 employees in the Nordic region. We believe that our decentralized business model contributes to the profitability of our operations. This decentralized and entrepreneurial business model allows us to swiftly adjust to a largely variable cost structure and promotes enterprise and accountability at all levels of our structure with the president of each business area being responsible, together with their management groups, for the operations and earnings in their respective business areas. We have been owned by Triton Partners since 2015, and since then have expanded our geographical presence and volumes through the acquisition of 38 additional companies to date (excluding Fidelix), the largest of which being a carve-out from construction company Skanska, Skanska Installation, acquired in 2016. Our organic and inorganic growth has made us into a complete installation and service partner, with the strength of a multidisciplinary group and the personal presence of a local company. In the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, we had total net revenue of SEK 10,133 million, a net profit for the period of SEK 42 million, EBITA of SEK 304 million, Adjusted EBITA of SEK 569 million and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of SEK 851 million. This was supported by our strong order backlog, which stood at SEK 8,245 million as of September 30, 2020. 80 -----",,as_expected,2020,384,

1629,Final Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.3,Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations General Economic Conditions and Activity in the Installation Market,17.3.1,,"Macroeconomic factors in the geographic markets in which we operate affect customer demand and, in turn, our results of operations. These factors include GDP fluctuations in Sweden, Norway and Finland, the three main countries in which we operate. During periods of strong GDP growth, our activity is fueled by industrial investments, public sector infrastructure projects and commercial construction. During recessionary periods, our installation business typically experiences a decline in net revenue which correlates to reduced levels of capital investments by our customers. This includes reduced spending by national and local authorities, as well as industrial and utility companies, although public sector expenditure tends to decrease less relative to private sector spending. However, during recessionary periods, when customers significantly reduce their capital expenditures, demand in our service business, which is mainly driven by renovation and maintenance expenditures, has been generally resilient to macroeconomic changes and tends to be countercyclical, providing a more stable source of income. When macroeconomic conditions improve, we generally experience increases in revenues in both our installation business and our service business, as well as increased order flow. During the periods presented and prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, macroeconomic conditions remained generally stable, with high activity levels in the installation market. Housing construction slowed down in the metropolitan regions, which was however offset by increased public investments in primarily major infrastructure projects, hospitals and schools. While the COVID-19 outbreak has had, and continues to have, a material impact on business around the world and the economic environments in which they operate, our results of operations and cash flows have proven resilient to date. Although demand in our installation and services business has been adversely affected, the impact to date has been relatively low. Our net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 increased to SEK 7,277 million, compared to SEK 7,122 million, with organic performance remaining stable. In addition, although order intakes decreased to SEK 7,252 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 from SEK 8,652 million in the corresponding period in 2019, this decrease was driven primarily by two large orders in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 (representing a combined order intake of SEK 1,387 million), which provided a significant increase to our order intake, as opposed to any significant dampening of demand or cancellations due to COVID-19. Moreover, while we have experienced some disruptions to our installation projects (due to COVID-19 outbreaks at a limited number of construction sites) and services assignments (due to stringent lock-down measures in the second quarter of 2020), to date these have not been significant and we do not believe they are indicative of a macroeconomic shift in demand for our projects and services. Nevertheless, while our net revenue and order intake for the first three quarters of 2020 are promising, we expect the ultimate significance of the impact of reduced economic activity and disruptions, including the extent of their adverse impact on financial and operational results, will be primarily determined by the length of time that such reductions and disruptions continue, which will, in turn, depend on the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of measures that might be imposed in response to the pandemic and whether a vaccine or drug can be 81 ----- developed and deployed that allows business operations to return to their pre-pandemic form. Additionally, although to date the installation market has proved to be relatively resilient to the COVID-19 pandemic and we believe the underlying drivers for long-term growth remain, we have experienced increased competition due to more uncertain market conditions. In light of this uncertainty, we believe it is beneficial to be a large, stable player with an ability to identify and react quickly to market changes, which we believe our leading market position, strong financial position and decentralized business model allows us to achieve.",,as_expected,2020,384,
1629,Final Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Active Portfolio Management,17.4.1,,"We generally seek to maintain balanced and sustained revenue flows by prioritizing smaller, shorter-term, highmargin contracts and maintaining a balance between installation and service contracts with a diverse range of customers operating in various end-markets. When one of our end-markets, such as industrial manufacturing, is experiencing lower expenditure, we can benefit from increased spending in another sector, such as hospitals (which are generally not impacted by the business cycle). We also actively reallocate resources in response to demand in those regions. Providing sales visibility and allowing active management is our installation business order book, which we track with two metrics we call order intake and order backlog. Order intake represents the value of projects received during any relevant period, plus changes to existing projects made during that period. Order backlog represents the value of remaining (not yet accrued) production value in all projects not generated at the end of the relevant period.",,as_expected,2020,384,
1629,Final Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.5,Our Cost Structure and Operational Improvement Program,17.5.1,,"We have a flexible cost structure, which helps to preserve margins during economic downturns. Variable and semi-variable costs (including subcontracting costs, temporary and fixed-term employees and installation materials and consumables used) constitute the majority of our operating expenses. We maintain low levels of inventory and our suppliers deliver directly to our work sites, which helps reduce our fixed costs and allows us to adjust our cost structure in response to market demand. For the year ended December 31, 2019, raw materials and consumables amounted to SEK 3,404 million, or 35.0%, subcontractors and purchased services amounted to SEK 1,366 million, or 14.0%, personnel costs amounted to SEK 4,134 million, or 42.5%, consultant fees amounted to SEK 71 million, or 0.7%, IT costs and telephony amounted to SEK 69 million, 0.7%, depreciation and amortization amounted to SEK 217 million, or 2.2% and other operating costs amounted to SEK 422 million, or 4.3% of our total operating expenses of SEK 9,726 million. In addition, during 2019, in particular in the fourth quarter of 2019, we undertook a number of cost saving initiatives and operational efficiency measures to improve profitability, comprising: Š reductions in overhead costs in Group functions, business area regional level as well as in branches; Š closure of unprofitable branches, including eight branches and several sub-branches; and Š turnaround plans being implemented for selected unprofitable branches across all segments. In connection with the implementation of the cost savings initiatives described above, we incurred restructuring costs in the aggregate amount of SEK 148 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 (representing an increase from the initial estimated SEK 121 million due to an increase in the originally anticipated number of branch closures and related costs).",,as_expected,2020,384,
1629,Final Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.6,Seasonality,17.6.1,,"Our revenues and costs are subject to seasonal variation, limiting the overall comparability of interim financial periods. We account for revenue in accordance with the degree of completion of the project. Therefore, when a public holiday falls in a given interim period, there are fewer working days and as a result we recognize less revenue from our ongoing projects. Our working capital needs are seasonal, although they are generally negative due to our customer contracts and focus on invoice collection. We invoice our customers regularly, in the case of ongoing and completed installation and service projects. Cash flow tends to be generally the strongest in the fourth quarter, with public and private sector customers seeking to meet their maintenance and operating expenses budgets but also due to many projects being completed in this quarter before the year-end and onset of winter. Cash flow in August and September tends to be relatively weaker because of lower business activity in the month of July and August, which is the main annual holiday period in our markets. 82 ----- Despite this seasonal trend, we have experienced strong cash flows during the nine months ended September 30, 2020, which have been positively affected by increased focus on invoicing practices during the COVID-19 outbreak, resulting in working capital inflows. Moreover, to date, we have not experienced any significant delays in the payment of invoices by our customers. We may, however, experience an increase in working capital needs if the markets in which we operate are subject to significant recessionary periods due to the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Amounts included in our _estimated order backlog may not result in actual revenue or translate into profits, and our estimated order backlog is subject to delays, customer bankruptcy, accounting errors and unexpected adjustments and is therefore an uncertain indicator of future results of operations.” Increased demand in our service business,_ which tends to be countercyclical, typically result in more working capital outflows, as compared to our installation projects.",,as_expected,2020,384,
1629,Final Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.7,Foreign Currency Exchange Rates,17.7.1,,"Our reported results of operations and financial condition are affected by exchange rate fluctuations due to both transaction risk and financial reports from operations abroad. Our business operations are characterized by a relatively low level of transactional currency risk since our purchases and sales are made in the same local currency with minimal exposure to imported components. However, we are exposed to risks relating to translation into Swedish kronor of income statements and balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries with local reporting denominated in euro (in the case of operations in Finland) and Norwegian kroner. _Transactional risk: Transactional risk arises when our subsidiaries execute transactions in a currency other than_ their functional currency. Transactions in foreign currency are restated in the functional currency at the exchange rate in effect on the transaction date. Functional currency is the currency in which the primary financial environments where the companies conduct their operations. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency are restated in the functional currency at the exchange rate in effect on the balance-sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising in the restatements are recognized in profit or loss for the year. Non-monetary assets and liabilities recognized at historical cost are restated at the exchange rate on the transaction date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities recognized at fair value are restated in the functional currency at the exchange rate in effect on the date of measurement at fair value. We generally benefit from a natural hedge against currency fluctuations in the three countries in which we operate because we incur costs and receive revenues in the applicable local currency. However, we purchase equipment from suppliers who generally operate in euro, and these suppliers may change their Swedish kronor prices to reflect fluctuations in the Swedish kronor to euro exchange rate. _Financial reports from operations abroad: Assets and liabilities in operations abroad, including goodwill and_ other Group-related surpluses and deficits, are restated from the functional currency of the operations abroad in the Group’s reporting currency at the exchange rate in effect on the balance-sheet date. Revenue and expenses in operations abroad are restated in Swedish kronor at an average rate that constituted an approximation of the exchange rates that were in effect on the respective transaction dates. Translation differences arising in connection with currency restatements are recognized in Other comprehensive income, and are accumulated in a separate component in equity, designated as translation reserves. In the event the operations abroad are not wholly owned, the translation difference is allocated to holdings with a non-controlling interest based on its proportional ownership share. When controlling interest, significant interest or joint controlling interest for operations abroad are dissolved, the accumulated translation differences attributable to the operations are realized, at which point they are reclassified from the translation reserves in equity to profit or loss for the year. In the event a sale occurs but controlling interest remains, a proportional share of accumulated translation differences from the translation reserve is transferred to holdings with a non-controlling interest. In the event of a sale of portions of associates and joint ventures where significant interest or joint controlling interest remains, a proportional share of the translation differences are reclassified to profit or loss for the year. We did not experience significant gains or losses as a result of fluctuations of Norwegian kroner and the euro against Swedish kronor during the periods under review.",,as_expected,2020,384,

As a result, increases in labor costs have a material impact on our result of operations. As 83 ----- almost all of our labor force is subject to collective bargaining agreements, wages are generally subject to annual increases determined by the labor unions in accordance with the collective bargaining agreements. Between 2017 and 2019, our personnel costs have increased by 18.6%, driven by the increases in wages and provisions for severances (in connection with our accelerated profitability program), as well as a more modest increase in the total number of employees and certain changes to expense category classifications applied starting from 2019. In addition, our growth can at times be constrained by our ability to find skilled labor force necessary to complete our installation projects or perform service assignments. See “Risk Factors—Our success is highly dependent on _the ability to recruit and retain technical and other key personnel.” For example, future restrictions on travel,_ including due to the COVID-19 outbreak, may also adversely affect our ability to successfully find sufficient subcontractors, which could have a material adverse effect on our installation projects, particularly in Norway. Moreover, increased sick leave experienced during the COVID-19 outbreak may adversely affect our service assignments as it is generally more difficult to find suitable replacement personnel (as compared to installation projects, for which subcontracting is typically an available option). Although there have been periodic increases in sick leave (including during the three months ended September 30, 2020), to date our services business has not been significantly adversely affected. In particular, we have adapted our operations to comply with the authorities’ recommendations in Sweden, Finland and Norway. Moreover, a standard risk assessment that is conducted for all assignments now includes an analysis of any possible spread of infection. We will continue to prioritize the safety and health of our employees and customers, including by monitoring developments in respect of the COVID-19 outbreak and by adapting our operations to implement any further government recommendations.",,as_expected,2020,384,

Our expenses for this equipment and these materials are subject to fluctuations based on our activity levels and the prices of the equipment and materials we purchase. During periods of strong economic growth, our expenditures on equipment and other materials are higher, due to the fact that our installation business, which requires more purchases of materials, makes up a larger share of our total sales than is the case during recessionary periods. We continually seek to consolidate our purchases to achieve volume-based discounts from our suppliers. During economic downturns, when our service business makes up a larger share of our total sales than our installation business, our expenditures on equipment and other materials are lower, due to the fact that maintenance services require the use of less equipment and materials. The prices of the equipment we purchase are subject to variation based on the fluctuations in the prices of raw materials (primarily aluminum, copper and steel) used to produce that equipment.",,as_expected,2020,384,

In 2016, we acquired Skanska Installation, further solidifying our strong position in the Swedish market. In 2017, we made three small “bolt-on” acquisitions in Sweden, and as a result, our net revenue increased by SEK 55 million. In 2018, we completed five small “bolt-on” acquisitions in Sweden, Norway and Finland, as a result of which our net revenue increased by SEK 288 million. In 2019, we acquired businesses with a total turnover of over SEK 500 million, strengthening our Electrical business area’s industrial service footprint (Norrlands Industimontage), building our Heating and Sanitation business area’s capabilities in the district heating niche (Värmesvets Entreprenad, KP Svets & Smide and Industri och Varmemontage Werme AB) as well as expanding our geographical coverage in Norway to the Lillehammar region (Arve Hagen AS, Ramsøy AS and Gjøvik Varme and Sanitær AS). In the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we completed seven small “bolt-on” acquisitions (in the form of share and asset purchases) in Sweden across several of our business areas, including: Electrical (Elservice i Åmål AB), Heating and Sanitation (Botkyrka VVS & Fastighetsservice AB, El & Installationsteknik i Stockholm AB and SDC Stockholm Design & Construction AB) and Ventilation (Luftkompaniet Sjöblom AB, Projektuppdrag Syd AB and Örestadskyl AB). These companies have a total of over 80 employees and estimated aggregated annual revenues of SEK 246 million. These acquisitions were made with cash on balance sheet. Additional variable cash consideration of up to SEK 59 million was payable over the next three years as of September 30, 2020. See Note 7 to the Unaudited Condensed Interim Financial Statements and Note 32 to the Audited Combined Financial Statements. In addition, since October 1, 2020, we have completed an additional thirteen small “bolt-on” acquisitions (in the form of share and asset purchases) in Sweden, Norway and Finland and 84 ----- across each of our business areas, including: Electrical (J.Östling & C.

Svendsen AS) and Finland (KK Kylmäpalvelu Oy, Salon Kylmäpoja Oy and Karjalan Kylmäpalvelu Oy). These companies have a total of over 270 employees and estimated aggregated annual revenues of over SEK 450 million. The acquisitions completed after September 30, 2020 were made with cash on balance sheet for an aggregate cash consideration of approximately SEK 310 million, of which SEK 300 million has been paid as of the date hereof and SEK 10 million will be payable at a later date under the terms of the relevant acquisition agreements. Furthermore, up to SEK 80 million of additional variable cash consideration is payable over the next three years for the acquisitions completed after September 30, 2020. See Note 7 to the Unaudited Condensed Interim Financial Statements. Excluding the asset purchase transactions (Elservice i Åmål AB, Mälardalens Fjärrvärme Entreprenad AB and FBI Fastighet o Butiksinstallationer AB), we estimate, based on each company’s historical EBITDA derived from its management accounts, as adjusted in a manner consistent with the adjustments applied to our Adjusted EBITDA to the extent applicable and as further adjusted for the application of our accounting policies and other items, that the acquisitions completed since September 30, 2019 would have a positive EBITDA impact of SEK 101 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 if each of the acquisitions was completed on October 1, 2019 (of which, SEK 39 million is attributable to completed acquisitions in the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, with the remaining SEK 62 million attributable to completed acquisitions after September 30, 2020). On December 8, 2020, Assemblin AB entered into a sale and purchase agreement to acquire Fidelix from the shareholders and option rights holders in Fidelix. The Fidelix Acquisition is subject to approval from the Finnish competition authority. We estimate based on Fidelix’s historical EBITDA derived from its management accounts, as adjusted for certain non-recurring items and the estimated pro forma effect of an acquisition by Fidelix, that the Fidelix Acquisition would have a positive EBITDA impact of SEK 80 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 if such acquisition had completed on October 1, 2019. The adjustment is based on Fidelix’s historical EBITDA derived from its management accounts, as adjusted for certain non-recurring items, the estimated pro forma effect of an acquisition by Fidelix and the application of consistent accounting policies.

1629,Final Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.13,Description of Key Line Items,17.13.1,,"Set forth below is a brief description of our key income statement line items. _Net revenue consist primarily of revenue from construction contracts and service assignments._ Š For our construction contracts, revenue from ongoing contracts is recognized over time on the basis of assignment expenditures incurred in relation to the total estimated assignment fees of the assignment. Costs associated with this are recognized in earnings as they arise. Revenue is based on a contractual fixed price; the remuneration amount is variable only in exceptional cases. Changes in the scope of the assignment, claims and incentive remuneration are included in project revenue to the extent that they are agreed upon with the customer and can be reliably measured. A fundamental condition for reporting revenue over time is that the course of events can reasonably be measured against completion of the performance obligation. For projects in which the outcome of a performance obligation cannot reasonably be measured, but coverage is expected for the expenditures that arise from completing the performance obligation, only revenue for expenditures incurred up until the result of the performance obligation can reasonably be measured is reported. Š For our service assignments, revenue and the appurtenant costs are recognized over time (meaning, in pace with the service being provided to the customer). Measurement of the course of events is established on the basis of assignment expenditures incurred in relation to the total estimated assignment expenditures. For further information on our revenue recognition policy, see Note 1 to the Audited Combined Financial Statements. _Cost for production primarily consist of (i) personnel costs, including wages, bonuses and social security costs,_ (ii) raw materials and consumables costs, (iii) subcontractors and purchased services costs, and (iv) premises directly linked to production, such as warehouses or workshops. In the year ended December 31, 2019 and the nine months ended September 30, 2020, personnel costs accounted for the largest proportion of cost for production. _Sales and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel expenses in connection with the general_ management of our business, including wages, bonuses and social security costs, rental costs for our premises and other overhead costs as well as non-billable white-collar time. _Financial income consists of interest income on invested funds, dividend income, and gains on changes in value_ of financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss. Dividend income is recognized when the right to receive dividends has been established. _Financial expenses consist of interest charged on loans, and the effect of unwinding the present value of_ provisions. _Net financial items consist of net financial income and expense and net foreign exchange gains and foreign_ exchange losses. _Tax consists of consists of current tax (comprising income tax in each country where we operate) and deferred_ tax.",,as_expected,2020,384,

The difference between assets and liabilities is due to the reclassification of pre-paid lease expenses, and moreover, rights of use being recognized based on IFRS 16 having been applied since the start of the agreement as well as the right-of-use assets being reduced by reserves for onerous leases recognized in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets immediately prior to the transition to IFRS 16 on December 31, 2018. When measuring the lease liability, we discounted its lease expenses at the marginal interest rate on borrowings at January 1, 2019. The interest rate used in discounting future flows lies between 1.7% and 4.8%, depending on the tenor of the contract. Previous financial leases have been reclassified from property, plant and equipment to right-of-use assets. 88 ----- The right-of-use assets recognized are attributable to the following types of assets:",,as_expected,2020,384,
1629,Final Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.15,IFRS 16 Leases,17.15.2,,"As of January 1, 2019, we apply IFRS 16 Leases. This reporting standard replaces IAS 17 Leases. The Group has selected the modified retrospective approach as the transition method, which means that the comparison figures for 2018 and earlier periods are not restated, and that the difference between right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized in equity adjusted for pre-paid lease expenses and reserves for onerous contracts as at January 1, 2019. The effects of IFRS 16 are recognized at the Group level. The Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the commencement date of a lease. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which consists of the original value of the lease liability plus lease expenses paid on or before the commencement date and any initial 87 ----- direct expenses. The right-of-use asset is thereafter depreciated on a straight-line basis from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the asset and the end of the lease term. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the future lease expenses over the term of the lease that have not been paid on the commencement date. The lease expenses are discounted with the incremental borrowing rate or implicit interest rate of the lease. The term of the lease comprises the non-cancellable period, with the addition of further periods in the contract if, on the commencement date, it is deemed reasonably certain that these will be exercised. The lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective rate method. The lease liability is remeasured if the future lease expenses change as the result of such factors as changes to an index or price. When the lease liability is remeasured this way, an equivalent adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset. _Leases where the Group is lessee_ Previously, the Group determined whether an agreement contained a lease in accordance with IFRIC 4 Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease. As of January 1, 2019, the Group determines whether an agreement contains a lease based on the definition of leases in IFRS 16. At the transition to IFRS 16, the Group chose to apply the relief rule of “inheriting” the previous definition of leasing in conjunction with the transition. This means that IFRS 16 is applied to agreements that were previously identified as leases, and that IFRS 16 is not applied to agreements that previously were deemed not to contain leases. Consequently, the definition of leases under IFRS 16 is applied only the agreements that were amended or signed after January 1, 2019. Previously, the Group classified leases as operating or finance leases based on whether the lease transferred the risks and rewards of ownership of the underlying asset. In accordance with IFRS 16, the Group recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for most leases (in other words, the lease is included in the statement of financial position); exemptions from this are indicated below. _Leases previously classified as operating leases under IAS 17_ At the transition, the lease liabilities were measured at the present value of the remaining lease expenses, discounted by the Group’s marginal interest rates on borrowings on the initial date of application (January 1, 2019). Each right-of-use asset was measured at an amount corresponding to the lease liability, adjusted for any prepaid or accrued lease expenses and reserves for onerous contracts. We chose to apply the following solutions in practice: Š Applied a discount rate based on the Group’s financing expenses on various maturities. Š Adjusted the right-of-use asset by an amount recognized as a provision for operating leases that constituted onerous leases, immediately before the first date of application, as an alternative to performing an impairment review. Š Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities have not been recognized for leases for which the lease term finishes within twelve months or earlier (short-term leases). Š Excluded initial direct payments from the measurement of the right-of-use asset on the first date of application.",,as_expected,2020,384,

Of the total growth, 3.8% was due to acquisitions, which was offset primarily by adverse foreign exchange effects. Organic growth was (0.1)%, which was primarily attributable to the closure of a number of unprofitable units in late 2019 for which we did not generate the same level of net revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 due to the winding down of those branches. Additionally, we experienced enhanced production in several major projects in the nine months ended September 30, 2019, which we was not repeated to the same extent in the corresponding period in 2020. Net revenue from service assignments increased by 6.5% to SEK 2,862 million from SEK 2,688 million, and net revenue from contractor assignments decreased slightly to SEK 4,414 million from SEK 4,434 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 from the same period in the prior year. Order intake for the period decreased 16.2% period-on-period to SEK 7,252 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, compared to SEK 8,652 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2019, driven in particular by two large orders in 2019: Stockholm Bypass project from the Swedish Transportation Administration and the new health care building in the Malmö hospital district (representing a combined order intake of SEK 1,387 million). The order backlog as of September 30, 2020 decreased to SEK 8,245 million, compared to SEK 8,478 million as of September 30, 2019. _Electrical Segment_ Net revenue of the Electrical segment for the period remained flat at SEK 2,932 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to SEK 2,934 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. Net 89 ----- revenue grew in the first six months of 2020 (as compared to the corresponding period 2019), which was offset by a decrease in net revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2020 due to enhanced activity in operations in the corresponding period in 2019. Order intake decreased from SEK 3,309 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to SEK 3,038 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, driven primarily by two large projects in 2019: the assignments in Malmö’s hospital district and the LKAB relocation project in Kiruna. As of September 30, 2020, order backlog amounted to SEK 3,102 million compared to SEK 2,970 million as of September 30, 2019. _Heating and Sanitation Segment_ Net revenue of the Heating and Sanitation segment increased by 0.8%, from SEK 1,908 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to SEK 1,924 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The increase in net revenue over the first six months of 2020 were offset in part by a decrease in net revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2020 (compared to the corresponding period in 2019), primarily due to the closure of a number of unprofitable units in late 2019 and the enhanced level of activity in operations during the second half of 2019. Order intake decreased from SEK 2,351 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to SEK 1,963 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, driven primarily by two large projects included in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 described above in connection with the Electrical segment, which significantly contributed to the order intake for that period. Order backlog as of September 30, 2020 increased to SEK 2,103 million, compared to SEK 2,085 million as of September 30, 2018. _Ventilation Segment_ Net revenue of the Ventilation segment decreased by 1.7%, from SEK 1,000 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to SEK 983 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, driven primarily by lower sales volume in the first three months of 2020 (compared to the corresponding period in 2019) attributable to delayed start dates in a small number of major publicly funded assignments due to slower planning process than anticipated (and unrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic). This decrease was offset in part by increases in net revenue over the subsequent six months of 2020 (as compared to the corresponding period in 2019). Decreases in order intakes from SEK 1,932 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to SEK 1,675 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, were driven primarily by the two large projects included in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 described above in connection with the Electrical segment, which significantly contributed to the order intake for that period. Order backlog as of September 30, 2020 decreased to SEK 1,675 million, compared to SEK 1,932 million as of September 30, 2019. _Norway Segment_ Net revenue of the Norway segment increased by 19.8%, from SEK 904 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to SEK 1,083 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, driven primarily by previously completed acquisitions and ongoing projects within those companies and new installation and service assignments. Order intake decreased slightly from SEK 1,176 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to SEK 1,132 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Management believes that order book in Norway is currently at full capacity. Accordingly, we took a selective approach to undertaking new projects. Order backlog as of September 30, 2020 decreased to SEK 1,132 million, compared to SEK 1,176 million as of September 30, 2019. _Finland Segment_ Net revenue of the Finland segment increased by 1.7%, from SEK 418 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to SEK 425 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, driven by new assignments, which included primarily small installation and service assignments. Order intake increased from SEK 369 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to SEK 427 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Order backlog as of September 30, 2020 decreased to SEK 233 million, compared to SEK 316 million as of September 30, 2019.",,as_expected,2020,384,

The improvement in earnings and profitability was driven by measures to enhance profitability that were taken in late 2019 through our accelerated profitability program, in combination with profitable acquisitions. These improvements were offset in part by negative effects on demand from the COVID-19 pandemic (particularly in second quarter of 2020), as well as a project write-down in Finland (also in the second quarter of 2020). In addition, earnings and profitability for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 were negatively impacted by the first-quarter project write-downs in Norway and Finland totaling SEK 23 million (before recovering in both the second and third quarters). Adjusted EBITA for the Electrical segment increased by 8.6% from SEK 128 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to SEK 139 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, while the Adjusted EBITA Margin was 4.4% and 4.7% in the respective periods, primarily driven by the positive effects of our accelerated profitability program. For the Heating and Sanitation segment, Adjusted EBITA increased by 10.1% from SEK 89 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to SEK 98 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, and while the Adjusted EBITA Margin also improved from 4.7% to 5.1% over the same period, primarily due to the positive effects of our accelerated profitability program. 91 ----- Adjusted EBITA for the Ventilation segment increased by 13.9% from SEK 36 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to SEK 41 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, while Adjusted EBITA Margin also improved from 3.6% to 4.2% over the same period.

Of the total growth, 8.3% is attributable to organic growth and the remainder was due to acquisitions (3.7%) and foreign exchange effects (0.3%). Organic growth was driven primarily by increasing volumes from both installation and service assignments in all business areas, particularly in the Electrical segment. Net revenue from service assignments and contractor assignment operations increased by 13.2% to SEK 3,833 million from SEK 3,387 million and 11.8% to SEK 6,145 million from SEK 5,498 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019 from the same period in the prior year.

Increases in order intakes from SEK 1,204 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to SEK 1,956 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 were driven by the new assignments in Malmö’s hospital district and the LKAB relocation project in Kiruna. Order backlog as of December 31, 2019 increased to SEK 1,805 million, compared to SEK 1,338 million as of December 31, 2018. _Norway Segment_ Net revenue of the Norway segment increased by 19.8%, from SEK 1,073 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to SEK 1,285 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, driven primarily by previously completed acquisitions and new installation and service assignments.

The higher growth of cost of production relative to net revenue increase was primarily related to business mix as the costs for production in the year ended December 31, 2019 was driven by a relatively higher proportion of early-stage projects (late-stage projects typically enjoying higher margins as the outcome becomes more certain) as well as lower amount of pass-through costs incurred (such as subcontractor costs), compared to the same period in 2018. To a lesser extent, project write-downs in the first quarter of 2019 in Norway and Finland also contributed to the effect.",,as_expected,2020,384,

Earnings and profitability for the period were negatively impacted in 2019 by the first-quarter project write-downs in Norway and Finland totaling SEK 23 million, but they recovered in subsequent quarters, including due to the number of cost saving initiatives and operational efficiency measures to improve profitability that were launched in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITA for the Electrical segment increased by 34.5% from SEK 165 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to SEK 222 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, while the Adjusted EBITA Margin also improved from 4.6% to 5.3% over the same period. For the Heating and Sanitation segment, Adjusted EBITA increased by 29.9% from SEK 107 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to SEK 139 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to previously completed acquisitions with good profitability, while the Adjusted EBITA Margin also improved from 4.5% to 5.3% over the same period. Adjusted EBITA for the Ventilation segment remained stable at SEK 73 million and SEK 73 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively, while Adjusted EBITA Margin declined from 5.5% to 5.3%. The difference year-on-year is attributable in part to costs related to the start-up of large new projects with limited material content in early phases and conservative margins, as well as comparability with the strong completion of two large projects in the first quarter of 2018. In the Norway segment, weaker profitability in the first quarter of the year (due to the project write-downs mentioned above) experienced robust recovery in subsequent quarters. Adjusted EBITA for the period declined slightly from SEK 71 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to SEK 70 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, while the Adjusted EBITA Margin also declined from 6.6% to 5.4% over the same period.

Of the total growth, 6.9% consisted of organic growth and the remainder was due to acquisitions. Organic growth was driven in part by a stable inflow of smaller and medium-sized local assignment and in part by larger assignments. Interest in multi-tech assignments and partnering projects grew in major procurements, which is favorable for major providers of complete service and installation solutions like Assemblin. Sales rose in all segments, primarily in Norway and Ventilation. Order intake for the period decreased year-on-year to SEK 9,459 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to SEK 9,899 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, while order backlog increased from SEK 6,223 million as of December 31, 2017 to SEK 6,971 million as of December 31, 2018. Among the large new contract assignments announced during 2018 were a large proportion of multi-tech assignments, including the first phase of New Hospital District (NSM) in Malmö, the renovation of Sollentuna Hospital and a housing project in the Västra Hamnen district of Malmö. _Electrical Segment_ Net revenue of the Electrical segment was stable, at SEK 3,559 million and SEK 3,592 million, respectively for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018. Major projects in 2018 included the ESS research facility in Lund, the Patienten hospital construction in Stockholm, the terminal expansion at Landvetter Airport, the C4 Shopping center in Kristianstad and Hubben in Uppsala Science Park. As of December 31, 2018, order backlog amounted to SEK 2,590 million compared to SEK 2,026 million as of December 31, 2017. _Heating and Sanitation Segment_ Net revenue of the Heating and Sanitation segment increased by 5.9%, from SEK 2,256 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to SEK 2,388 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Growth was greatest in servicing, which grew 16.5% year-on-year. Ongoing larger projects included student housing at Campus Albano in Stock-holm, residences at Parken 2 in Lund, the new Geely main office in Gothenburg, the conversion of the Patienten hospital building in Stockholm and the terminal expansion at Landveter Airport. Order backlog as of December 31, 2018 increased to SEK 1,602 million, compared to SEK 1,381 million as of December 31, 2017. _Ventilation Segment_ Net revenue of the Ventilation segment increased by 22.9%, from SEK 1,072 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to SEK 1,317 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, driven primarily by organic growth and, to a lesser extent, completed acquisitions. Increased order intake was driven by the new assignments in Malmö’s hospital district. Larger ongoing projects included the Högland hospital in Eksjö, the Gäddorna 98 ----- office and residential properties in Malmö and the Chopin and Solletuna Sjukhus hostpital projects in Stockholm, as well as new service assignment with Skandiafastigheter. Order backlog as of December 31, 2018 decreased to SEK 1,338 million, compared to SEK 1,527 million as of December 31, 2017. _Norway Segment_ Net revenue of the Norway segment increased by 25.4%, from SEK 856 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to SEK 1,073 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, driven primarily by organic growth. The largest ongoing projects are the new office at Orkla, Tønsberg hospital project, the Tomtebrygga B1 hotel and residential property, the HSM Doyén residential district in the greater Oslo area. Order backlog as of December 31, 2018 increased to SEK 1,097 million, compared to SEK 965 million as of December 31, 2017. _Finland Segment_ Net revenue of the Finland segment increased by 9.6%, from SEK 492 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to SEK 539 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, driven by translation effects and organic growth offsetting the effect of discontinued pipeline renovation operations.

1629,Final Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.32,Liquidity and Capital Resources,17.32.1,,"“Liquidity” describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flow to meet the cash requirements of its business operations, including but not limited to working capital needs, capital expenditures, debt service obligations, contractual obligations and acquisitions. Our primary uses of liquidity are to meet our debt service obligations, to fund capital expenditures and selected bolt-on acquisitions and to fund changes in working capital. Our primary sources of liquidity are provided by cash generated from our operating activities, our leasing facilities which we utilize primarily to fund vehicle purchases, and further supplemented by amounts drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility. We expect to draw on the Revolving Credit Facility to service our working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes. Borrowings and availability under the Revolving Credit Facility will be subject to certain conditions precedent, including compliance with financial maintenance and other covenants and representations and warranties. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—The _Super Senior Facilities.” Additionally, in connection with the Fidelix Acquisition, we expect the Sponsor to_ contribute €20 million (or approximately SEK 210 million) in cash on or about the Completion Date in the form of an equity contribution. Although we believe that our expected cash flow from operating activities will be adequate to meet our expected liquidity needs, including our debt service obligations, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet these needs or that future debt or equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including making payments on the Notes or on our other debt when due. If our cash flow from operating activities is lower than expected, we may be required to seek additional financing, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Our ability to arrange financing generally and our cost of capital depend on numerous factors, including general economic conditions, the availability of credit from banks, other financial institutions and capital markets, restrictions in the instruments governing our debt and our general financial performance. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to _Our Financial Profile—Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations may make it difficult for us to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and operate our business” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Financial Profile—We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, including due to factors outside our control, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.”_",,as_expected,2020,384,

Although the first nine months of the year typically show adverse working capital development, compared to the year-end position, due to seasonal factors (see “—Key Factors Affecting Our _Results of Operations—Seasonality”), working capital requirements were positively impacted by improved_ invoicing practices.

Higher profitability in 2019 was more than offset by changes in working capital.

Other employees have pensions that are recognized as defined-contribution. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 30% of our employees had defined benefit pensions. Of these, the Swedish plan for electricity white-collar employees is recognized as defined-benefit for purposes of our financial statements, and is unfunded and based on final salary, which provides employees with benefits in the form of a guaranteed level of pension disbursements over their lifetimes. For the remaining white-collar employees in Sweden the defined-benefit pension obligations are secured through insurance with Alecta. For the financial year ended December 31, 2019, we did not have access to information that would make it possible to recognize this plan as a defined-benefit plan. The pension plan secured through insurance with Alecta is therefore recognized as a defined-contribution plan. Annual fees for pension insurance contracted with Alecta totaled SEK 55.5 million, SEK 51.5 million and SEK 50 million, in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Alecta’s surplus can be allocated to policy holders and/or the insured. Pension scheme liabilities vary with changes to long-term interest rates, inflation, pensionable salaries and the longevity of scheme members. During the periods under review, liabilities in respect of provisions for pensions increased from SEK 483 million as of December 31, 2017, to SEK 560 million as of December 31, 2018, to SEK 703 million as of December 31, 2019 before decreasing slightly to SEK 690 million as of September 30, 2020, with increases driven primarily by a decline in market interest rates, which resulted in the assumed discount rate for defined-benefit obligations decreasing from 2.57% as of December 31, 2017 to 2.40% as of December 31, 2018 to 1.40% as of December 31, 2019 and 1.38% at September 30, 2019. The increase in liabilities in respect of provisions for pensions also reflects the relatively greater proportion of plan participants that are not eligible for retirement, as compared to the number of former plan participants that have retired. See Note 8 to the Audited Combined Financial Statements for further information as to our pensions obligations and pensions costs. 105 ----- In accordance with the requirements of the pension administrator, we are required to provide bank guarantees in respect of a portion of the Group’s defined-benefit pensions obligations. We have been required to increase the amount of our current SEK 240 million bank guarantee (incurred under the Pension Guarantee Facility) by SEK 45 million, which additional amount was initially incurred under the Guarantee Facility. We expect to ultimately incur the full SEK 285 million under the Pension Guarantee Facility once we have increased the SEK 240 million of aggregate commitments thereunder by SEK 45 million, as permitted under the terms of the Pension Guarantee Facility Agreement to reflect increased guarantee requirements by the pension administrator (and to cancel the amount initially incurred under the Guarantee Facility). Our obligations with respect to the Pension Guarantee Facility and the Guarantee Facility are secured on the Collateral on a super senior basis to the Original Notes and the Additional Notes.

Our operations are decentralized and governed based on a shared framework, clear allocation of roles and responsibilities and systematic monitoring. Our branch managers are continuously supported and monitored at the regional, business area Group level to ensure appropriate risk managed and improved profitability. This support is carried out by, among other things, project selection controls and project execution controls. Management and administration are performed at the branch level by our branch-level managers at over 160 of our local branch offices in over 100 locations throughout the Nordic region. Our branch-level managers report to their respective regional manager who in turn reports to the Business Area manager who together with the CEO, CFO and Head of Communication form senior executive management.

1629,Final Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.59,INDUSTRY Overview,17.59.1,,"The Nordic installation market, which comprises the combined installation markets of Sweden, Norway and Finland, is a highly fragmented market and accounted for 35% of the overall Nordic construction market, at SEK 231 billion aggregate spend in 2019 according to Prognoscentret. The installation market can be segmented into two categories: (i) new-build installations and (ii) renovation, maintenance and services of existing installations. Because the Nordic construction market is mature, most of the activity is driven by renovation, maintenance and services of existing installations, rather than new-build. Š **_New-build installations represent about 29% (comprising 13.0% residential and 16.3% non-residential) of the Nordic installation market. Demand for new-build installation results generally from the demand for new-build construction and has therefore been sensitive historically to macroeconomic factors such as GDP growth, interest rates and realestate prices among other factors, although with a slight time lag owing to the downstream nature of the activity (installation occurring at the end of the construction process of a building). Although the new construction segment is generally cyclical, significant local and regional variations within different countries influence end-market exposure. It is also worth noting that public sector spendings have historically exhibited less volatility compared to the residential and commercial construction sectors, primarily because government spending in the Nordic region have historically been increased during economic downturns. Due to disruptions to economic activity caused by COVID-19, new construction activity in the near term is expected to experience some slowdown as projected by Euroconstruct in their report published in November 2020. However, the Group has limited exposure to markets expected to experience the sharpest contraction, such as new residential construction. Moreover, as a leading player with scale and a track record of execution excellence in a fragmented market, the Group is well positioned relative to the small- and medium-sized players to navigate the crisis and to potentially gain market share. Š **_Renovation, maintenance and services represent about 71% (comprising 26.2% service, 24.8% non-residential and 19.6% residential) of the Nordic installation market. Demand for maintenance has generally shown a higher level of stability compared to new-build and, similar to renovation, is largely driven by the age and composition of the buildings. During economic downturns, customers have a demonstrated preference for renovation and maintenance as opposed to new construction, which has traditionally resulted in countercyclical effects in the renovation and maintenance segment. Expenditures on renovation and maintenance are more flexibly managed and constitute part of a customer’s general operating expenses, making them less susceptible to reductions in customer spending and resulting in stable revenue flow for service providers. Moreover, demand for renovation and maintenance is primarily driven by the age and composition of real estate. The resilience of the renovation market has been highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as the construction market for renovation is expected to sustain stable growth in the near term as projected by Euroconstruct. The Nordic installation market can also be segmented by activity into: (i) Electrical; (ii) Heating and Sanitation and (iii) Ventilation. Š **_Electrical is one of the largest installation market segments, worth SEK 101 billion, according to Prognoscentret, and accounting for 44% of the overall installation market. Renovation, maintenance and service accounts for 73% of the Electrical segment, with non-residential renovation and maintenance being the largest building type segment. It includes the installation of wiring and fittings, lighting systems, street lighting, electrical signs, airport runway lighting, satellite dishes, alarms, solar energy collectors and connecting of electronic appliances, as well as their maintenance and repair. Š **_Heating and Sanitation accounts for 42% of the Nordic installation market and is worth SEK 98 billion. Renovation, maintenance and service accounts for 72% of the Heating and Sanitation segment, with residential renovation and maintenance being the largest building type segment. It includes the installation of plumbing and heating systems, as well as their maintenance and repair. Š **_Ventilation: Ventilation market is the smallest installation market segment, accounting for 14% of the Nordic installation market. 61% of the Ventilation market is renovation, maintenance and service, with service being the largest segment. It includes the installation of ventilation and air-conditioning systems, as well as their maintenance and repair. 109 ----- Some activities are regulated, and our technicians and engineers (in particular plumbers and electricians) are required to be certified. This creates staff scarcity in some market segments, in particular in the Electrical and Heating and Sanitation segments. Larger companies such as the Group are perceived as more stable and offering greater career opportunities to staff in the long- term.

The factors driving the robust market growth include energy efficiency, sustainability, cloud computing and IoT, tightening regulation, increase in energy prices and focus on indoor climate. Moreover the scope of activities and services for Fidelix is continuously expanding driven by advancements in technology in machine learning, automated diagnostics and smarter building automation systems.

These include: Š **_Energy efficiency: Increasing demand for energy efficient systems in buildings, driven by economic, environmental and regulatory pressures, provide significant growth opportunities, wherein installation solutions can be customized to each building to achieve low energy use. Stimulus programs introduced by various national governments and the EU to kick start recovery from the current economic slowdown are expected to help accelerate this trend as a number of these stimulus programs are specifically targeted or focused on the Green agenda. Examples include Sweden’s SEK 9.7 billion proposal for investments in green recovery initiatives in the Budget Bill for 2021, the EU’s €500 billion green stimulus package passed in July 2020, Norway’s May 2020 proposal to spend €360 million to support a greener economy and the EIB’s €150 million in financing for new near-zero-energy buildings and renovation investments to improve energy efficiency of existing buildings in the Helsinki metropolitan area; Š **_Growing demand for more advanced technology systems: Increasingly tech-heavy properties require more advanced technology systems, with a higher demand for IoT, energy efficient systems and security system automatization offering several growth avenues; Š **_Increasing pace of urbanization: Increased inflow of inhabitants in Nordic cities increases the need for new residential buildings and public properties while also placing greater requirements on safer and more efficient and modern premises; Š **_Higher degree of digitalization: Growing digitalization creates new requirements for managing data and allows for the creation of new technical installations to monitor and optimize energy efficiency while also driving greater demand for service due to increased complexity of technical installations and systems; 110 ----- Š **_Partnering projects: New forms of close collaboration between various parties in the construction process increases the importance of coordination of installations while also enabling greater efficiency in the production process and energy usage through multi-tech procurements; and Š **_Greater need for renovation in ageing buildings: A significant portion of the Nordic building stock is of considerable age prompting an upcoming renovation wave for buildings from the 1970s and 1980s and also driven by the potential to reduce energy usage in Sweden through renovations in existing building stock.",,as_expected,2020,384,
1629,Final Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.62,Competitive landscape,17.62.1,,"The Nordic installation market is highly fragmented, and competition is largely focused on a contract by contract basis at a local level. As a result, the Group rarely competes against larger pan-Nordic players such as Bravida, Instalco, Caverion, GK or Kemp & Lauritzen but rather against local small or medium-sized enterprises (“SMEs”), such as ELEffekt, Robmac and Stockholms Elektriska. However, we believe that customers demand an increasingly broad range of services and expertise from installation services providers, including a single point of contact for delivery of integrated solutions, in order to optimize their procurement process. Many SMEs specialize in a particular activity and regional area but are unable to offer “one-stop shop” solutions. This offers a potential advantage of larger groups and has led to the consolidation of small, local businesses over the years which is a trend we expect will continue. This is particularly true for larger projects which are generally awarded on price, but also on some qualitative factors such as breadth and depth of services, technical know-how, ability to deliver tailored, state-of-the-art solutions across multiple fields of technology, which tend to play well to the advantage of larger players. Scale itself is a differentiating factor as SMEs are unlikely to have the financial strength to undertake large, lengthy projects. Moreover, as customers increasingly evaluate the value position of service providers in terms of ongoing performance of installed equipment, technological competence is becoming particularly important. The Group has maintained a clear strategic focus on technologies and digital systems and Fidelix’s technology-driven focus will help solidify the Group’s positioning, particularly in one of the most attractive niches of the installation services market that caters to building automation. As a fully integrated player in this market, Fidelix faces competition from different parts of the value chain. Competitors include large industrial goods players such as Schneider and Siemens which are the only players bigger than Fidelix in its focus markets of Finland and Sweden. However, unlike Schneider and Siemens which are only focused on large projects, Fidelix is able to cover a wider installed base creating upselling and aftermarket sales opportunities, references and expertise across building types and deeper visibility into market outlook. Fidelix has been able to build on this further with its established position, open system and competitive pricing to capture market share as has been consistently seen historically and expected to continue forward. Local contracts tend to be of smaller size and often awarded based on customer relationships with managers at local branches, in addition to price considerations. It is therefore critical to empower staff locally so that they are incentivized to develop not only customer relationships and intimacy, but also raise brand awareness and maximize talent acquisition. Network density and customer proximity can create cost and service quality leadership which a one-branch competitor would not benefit from. 111 -----",,as_expected,2020,384,

Our strong relationships with our customers have contributed to an order backlog of SEK 8,245 million and an LTM order intake of SEK 9,859 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2020, and we currently have over 3,000 ongoing projects. We take on primarily two types of assignments: contractor assignments and service assignments. The proportion of contractor assignments and service assignments represented 60% and 40%, respectively, of our net revenue for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020. Our operations are decentralized and governed based on a shared framework, clear allocation of roles and responsibilities and systematic monitoring. Our current operating organization is divided into five specific business areas: three in Sweden (Assemblin El, Assemblin VS and Assemblin Ventilation), one in Norway (Assemblin Norway) and one in Finland (Assemblin Finland), comprising over 166 branches across over 100 locations with over 5,800 employees in the Nordic region. We believe that our decentralized business model contributes to the profitability of our operations. This decentralized and entrepreneurial business model allows us to swiftly adjust to a largely variable cost structure and promotes enterprise and accountability at all levels of our structure with the president of each business area being responsible, together with their management groups, for the operations and earnings in their respective business areas. The following map shows the branch footprint of our business areas, representing the locations in which we operated in the Nordic region as of September 30, 2020. We have been owned by Triton Partners since 2015, and since then have expanded our geographical presence and volumes through the acquisition of 40 additional companies to date (excluding Fidelix), the largest of which being a carve-out from construction company Skanska, Skanska Installation, acquired in 2016. Our organic and 112 ----- inorganic growth has made us into a complete installation and service partner, with the strength of a multidisciplinary group and the personal presence of a local company. In the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, we had total net revenue of SEK 10,133 million, a net profit for the period of SEK 42 million, EBITA of SEK 304 million, Adjusted EBITA of SEK 569 million and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of SEK 851 million. This was supported by our strong order backlog, which stood at SEK 8,245 million as of September 30, 2020. The table below sets out the net revenue, Adjusted EBITA (and corresponding margin), order backlog, share of service assignments, average number of FTE employees and number of branches for each of our business areas as of and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020.",,as_expected,2020,384,

The project is a fixed price project but is subject to indexation and consists mainly of material and subcontracted work where we have secured back to back agreements to minimize risk to our calculated margins. In addition, we have four contracts for work on the Malmö Hospital to be produced 2019 to 2024, of which two are conducted through joint-ventures. The current collective value of our joint ventures’ share of these contracts within Electrical, Heating and Sanitation, as well as our contracts within Ventilation, is SEK 1,099 million.",,as_expected,2020,384,
1629,Final Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.65,Competitive Strengths,17.65.1,Top Nordic player focused on regional leadership,"We are a leading provider of complete installation and service solutions in electrical engineering, heating and sanitation, ventilation and automation in the Nordic region. We hold a strong position in the growing installation market in Sweden, Norway and Finland, estimated at approximately SEK 231 billion as of December 31, 2019, and in 2019, we had the second largest share of Sweden’s installation market by revenue according to Prognoscentret. In addition, we believe we hold the number one position in the Oslo heating and sanitation market, and a top 5 position in Finland. Moreover, we expect the acquisition of Fidelix to provide us with a market-leading position within the building automation market in the Nordics. We are outperforming the market and gaining market share; specifically, in 2019, we held the second largest market share (8.4%) of the estimated SEK 98 billion installation market in Sweden, representing a market share increase of 75 basis points between 2017 and 2019. Our presence in Norway and Finland has also shown strong growth, with our market share (1.6%) of the estimated SEK 75 billion installation market in Norway increasing by 44 basis points between 2017 and 2019, and our market share (1%) of the estimated SEK 59 billion installation market in Finland increasing by 8 basis points over the same period. We have operated through our constituent subsidiaries in our key markets of Sweden, Norway and Finland for more than half a century and have a track record of completing contracts on time and in line with customer specifications, which is underpinned by our commitment to attaining the highest levels of customer satisfaction. We believe that brand 113 ----- awareness and market reputation are key factors for customers deciding upon a particular installation and services provider and that our established portfolio and track record, therefore, provide us with a significant competitive advantage. Importantly, we have developed high network density in our chosen markets, including nation-wide Sweden, the greater Oslo area (Norway) and in the Helsinki-Turku-Tampere triangle (Finland), with our footprint tailored to maximize regional leadership in an industry where local scale matters. Our market presence and the scale and geographic reach of our operations give us a clear advantage over our competitors, which in our fragmented market comprise mostly small or medium-sized enterprises. This is particularly the case with respect to contracts for major projects, which typically generate stable revenue streams and cash flows, as we are one of only a small number of companies in our markets with sufficient resources and expertise to be mandated on, and successfully execute, such contracts due to the scale, diversity and quality of our installation and service offering. Our geographic reach has enabled us to attain significant market positions in the regions where we operate, particularly in Sweden where, in terms of 2017 net revenue, we had nine regions ranked either number one or number two in electrical engineering, ten in heating and sanitation and six in ventilation. Only one of our competitors had more regions ranked higher in these categories than Assemblin in Sweden. Our Group and local scale provide differentiating competitive advantages. At the Group level, we are able to utilize our procurement expertise to optimize sourcing supplier terms within each business area and leverage on our digital capabilities. In addition, we leverage certain central functions such as finance, legal, communication and our central IT platform. At the local level, our geographic network comprises over 166 branches across over 100 locations in the Nordic region, in close proximity to our customers. In certain locations, our business areas share branch premises allowing for significant cross-selling and cost-reduction opportunities. In addition to being better positioned to win local tenders, our cross-staffing ability between branches allows us to optimize project selection. Further, our local scale has allowed us to build a workforce of over 5,800 employees in the Nordic region with many employees preferring to work for a larger company due to supportive and clear governance, stability, brand awareness and personal development opportunities.",,as_expected,2020,384,
1629,Final Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.65,Competitive Strengths,17.65.2,Execution excellence delivered by local branch managers and specialist staff,"We believe that our decentralized business model contributes to the profitability of our operations. Our current operating organization is divided into five specific business areas (Assemblin El, Assemblin VS, Assemblin Ventilation, Assemblin Norway and Assemblin Finland), which in turn consist of regions, divisions and branches where local decision making and project execution is undertaken. This decentralized and entrepreneurial business model allows us to swiftly adjust our largely variable cost structure (see “—Resilient and agile business model”) and promotes entrepreneurial culture and accountability at all levels of our structure with the president of each business area being responsible, together with their management groups, for the operations and earnings in their respective business areas. We believe that one of our key strengths is the division of our business by business area instead of by region. The focus on business areas allows our managers and their teams to prioritize their technical areas of expertise, it provides career development opportunities for our talented employees within their respective business lines, as well as it is also an important advantage in the mergers and acquisition context where the typical target company has one technical discipline, allowing the target company to join the appropriate part of our business which focuses on the target’s core strength. For example, we expect the Fidelix Group to be an independent business area within the Group, and Fidelix’s experienced management team will continue to play a critical role in Fidelix’s ongoing operations to help ensure continued success. Through our decentralized business model, our branch managers are incentivized to create value and lead a specialized and skilled workforce. Specifically, the interplay between specialist staff and strongly incentivized branch managers has led to improved profitability. Our specialist staff are supported by the Assemblin Academy and compulsory web courses to enhance their skillsets. In addition, employees are guided by clear development plans and career ladders, which, in turn, allows us to attract top quality employees. The focus on incentivizing specialist staff through measures such as the Assemblin Academy as well as our staff incentive plan has contributed to industry leading employee satisfaction at Assemblin, underpinning our ability to retain specialist staff. Specifically, in 2019, we achieved an employee net promoter score (“NPS”) of 18, compared to 4 in 2012, which was substantially higher than the industry average of 9. Furthermore, we have an employer reputation score of 3.3 in Sweden, which is the highest among our key competitors. 114 ----- On the branch manager side, branch managers’ decision-making is based on their in-depth local market knowledge and customer relationships supported by a specialized staff allowing branch managers to reduce costs and provide a geared installation and service offering to customers. Branch managers are strongly incentivized on EBITA Margin targets as well as efficient working capital management. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, enhanced monitoring at the branch level has allowed successful management of market and operational challenges stemming from COVID-19 restrictions. We have also experienced successful management of personnel shortfall due to sick leaves during COVID-19 through effective reallocation between assignments, allowing us to continue relying on our specialist staff. As a result of our investment in specialist staff and incentivizing our branch managers, the proportion of lossmaking branches has reduced from 38% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 19% for the year ended December 31, 2019, and these branches contributed only 14% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. The proportion of branches delivering over 7% of EBITA Margin has increased over the same period from 22% to 40%. The table below outlines the split of branches’ profitability level by EBITA Margin for the periods indicated, based on management estimates.",,as_expected,2020,384,

This high revenue visibility allows us to take a more stringent approach in our margin selection criteria. Our order intake volumes grow our backlog over time. Between September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2020, our order intake increased by 7.1% to SEK 7,252 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, compared to SEK 6,774 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2018. Moreover, we experienced our highest annual order intakes to date in the year ended December 31, 2019, reaching SEK 11,258 million (compared to SEK 9,459 million in 2018), which was driven in particular by two large orders: the Stockholm Bypass project from the Swedish Transportation Administration and the new health care building in the Malmö hospital district, which contributed SEK 520 million and SEK 867 million, respectively, to our order intake during that period. Order backlog as of September 30, 2020 was SEK 8,245 million, compared to SEK 6,780 million as of September 30, 2018, and the order intake for 2019 resulted in our reaching our highest annual order intake to date of SEK 8,478 million as of December 31, 2019.

This support is carried out by, among other things, project selection controls and project execution controls. In relation to project selection, tenders are approved based on project size, assuming standard contractual terms. Projects under €1 million can be approved directly by the branch office, with projects between €1 million to €2 million and €2 million to €5 million required to be approved at the region and business level, respectively. Projects between €5 million to €10 million must be approved at the Group level and contracts over €10 million are required to be approved by our Board.

Installation is the last part of the typical construction project, with multi-technical service providers having solid predictability of the project pipeline. As a result of our late stage involvement in projects, branch managers are able to identify early signs in the changes of market dynamics and adjust our variable cost base as necessary. Our ability to proactively manage or swiftly react to such changes in market dynamics is supported by our lean and decentralized operational organization of five business areas in three countries, spread across over 166 branches. Approximately 89% of our cost structure during the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 was variable or semi-variable, which provides us with substantial operational flexibility. Additionally, although to date the installation market has proved to be relatively resilient to the COVID-19 pandemic and we believe the underlying drivers for long-term growth remain, we have experienced increased competition due to more uncertain market conditions. In light of this uncertainty, we believe it is beneficial to be a large, stable player with an ability to identify and react quickly to market changes, which we believe our leading market position, strong financial position and decentralized business model allows us to achieve. Further, branch managers have a diverse end-market exposure with a high share of service assignments and mainly smaller projects. Based on our end-market analysis conducted for our largest business areas, Electrical and Heating & Sanitation, in terms of net revenue, between January 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020, a large part 116 ----- of our net revenue originated from cycle-resilient end-markets such as healthcare (10%), education & culture (8%), infrastructure (2%) and service assignments (42%). Further, we had limited exposure to the Swedish residential market as approximately 12% of our end-market exposure was attributable to project assignments in the residential market, with new residential builds representing an estimate of less than 5% of our total project revenue. Other limited end-market exposures include business (3%), offices (9%), hospitality (2%), warehouses (2%) and industrial (8%). Our business also has limited dependency on a specific customer or type of contract. According to the Group’s management estimates, our top ten customers accounted for approximately 30% of our net revenue for the for the year ended December 31, 2019. Further, based on net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019, projects (which includes both installation projects as well as certain service projects subject to percentage of completion accounting) under SEK 50 million, between SEK 50-100 million, over SEK 100 million represented 56%, 5%, 3% of our net revenue, respectively and the remaining 36% being other service assignments. Following Triton’s acquisition of the Group, we have pursued a strategy of low-risk and accretive bolt-on acquisitions in order to expand our business. Specifically, with Triton as our owner, we have grown through the acquisition of 40 additional companies (excluding Fidelix), the largest of which being a carve-out from construction company Skanska, Skanska Installation, acquired in 2016. The rest of our acquisitions comprised companies with an average revenue of approximately SEK 48 million and 25 employees. When completing an acquisition, we anticipate paying a multiple of approximately 4-6 times the target’s EBITA, consistent with the multiple for our recent historical acquisitions. For more information, see “—History.” We believe that our established track-record of low-risk bolt-on acquisitions in a consolidating market has allowed us to successfully realize synergies and integrate the workforce, and we intend to continue to pursue acquisitions in order to increase our market presence, our service offering and our service capacity.",,as_expected,2020,384,

Even when new contracts appear highly likely to be awarded as a result of our Integrated Project Delivery (“IPD”) (see “Business—Competitive Strengths”) pipeline, we exclude them until they are signed. In addition, the lead time on our backlog projects has been increasingly extended due to capacity constraints, which now requires customers to book projects earlier on. We currently hold a strong pipeline of large, more technical and publicly-funded contracts due to current structural needs for schools, hospitals and transport infrastructures in the Nordic region. We also benefit from an increasingly high rate of recurring service business and have experienced a meaningful increase in the conversion rate from project assignments, which primarily consist of new installation or the redevelopment of, and adaptations to, technical systems in buildings, plants, to service assignments, which comprise the operation, maintenance, repair, replacement, reconfiguration and monitoring of installations in buildings, plants and infrastructure. For example, the net revenue of our service business increased from SEK 2,922 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 to SEK 3,833 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, representing 35.8% and 38.4% of our total net revenue of SEK 8,169 million and SEK 9,978 million respectively. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, the net revenue of our service business was SEK 4,007 million, which represented 39.5% of our net revenue of SEK 10,133 million during this period. This increased service contribution improves our budget accuracy and drives profitable growth, particularly in the case of recurring services, which pose high barriers to entry for our competitors at the contract renewal stage. We endeavor to maximize client satisfaction and retention by taking a strategic approach to each customer relationship. This approach begins by establishing multiple touch points with the customer and developing a deep understanding of the client’s needs. Next, we offer a state-of-the-art digital platform that allows for continuous performance monitoring and improvement throughout each assignment. Finally, we provide a comprehensive breadth of service offerings and aim for performance beyond customer expectations in order to increase the likelihood of recurring service contracts going forward.",,as_expected,2020,384,

We define Cash Conversion as Free Cash Flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA. Changes in Net Working Capital is defined as the sum of the increase or decrease in inventories, the increase or decrease in net work in progress, the increase or decrease in total trade receivables, the increase or decrease in reserve for bad debt, the increase or decrease in other receivables, the increase or decrease in trade payables and the increase or decrease in other payables for the relevant period. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Presentation of Financial Information—Non-IFRS Measures.” For a reconciliation of these non-IFRS measures to IFRS financial information, see “Summary—Summary Combined Financial and Other _Information—Operating Data and Non-IFRS Financial Information.”_ Our high cash flow generation has been driven by our capital-lite operations together with efficient working capital management. Our operations require very limited capital expenditure, which primarily comprises tools, refurbishment and IT, with our Net Capital Expenditure representing 0.8% of net revenue for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020. Our service vehicle fleet which is directly linked to the growth of our service operations is being arranged through flexible financial lease arrangements.

For the definition of Net Working Capital, see “Presentation of Financial and Other Data—Non-IFRS Measures.” Our ability to generate Free Cash Flow has contributed to our growth and has allowed us to undertake our mergers and acquisition strategy and achieve deleveraging, including since the issuance of the Original Notes as demonstrated by the decrease in our ratio of total net debt to pro forma Adjusted EBITDA from 4.3x to 3.5x as of September 30, 2020 (without giving pro forma effect to this Offering).

We believe that we are well positioned to grow our leading local market positions throughout the Nordic region and strong local market positions by continuing to provide high-quality services and support to our customers and employees, and by focusing on our local operations.

We intend to continue to leverage our strong customer relationships and local market knowledge to meet our customers’ needs promptly and efficiently, in order to establish ourselves as the provider of choice in the markets in which we operate. We will enhance growth by targeting attractive local markets and remaining agile and flexible when it comes to our footprint so that capital and human resources are always allocated in the most accretive way. We will also continue to invest in markets where Assemblin is or has the ability to become the largest or second-largest operator so that we can leverage competitively our scale advantages and Group capabilities while strengthening our high customer intimacy.

We intend to utilize our reputation and intensify our brand awareness to continue to recruit and retain the best talents in the industry and to position ourselves as the employer of choice. We will also keep track and improve the performance of our existing managers and technicians by continuing to develop professional and technical training programs and by assigning our engineers and technicians to a wide range of fields.

However, we believe that there is scope to continue to increase our absolute margin level. While we differentiate our offering by providing consistent, high-quality installation and technical services and offering a wide range of services to our customers, we are also able to drive cost savings by driving best practices across our Group. In 2019, we completed our accelerated profitability improvement program targeted to optimize our branch network, reduce overhead expenditures and improve operational efficiency. This program provided us with tangible cost savings in 2019, and we intend to consolidate and build on the improvements achieved so far. Additionally, to continue to improve our margins and cash flow, we intend to continue focusing on project selection and execution to allow us to operate more efficiently and profitably in the short-term while reducing project risk in the long-term. Over time, we are also gaining a better understanding of key success factors and best practices by analyzing the operational data and profitability metrics on a project by project basis. We achieve this by measuring branch profitability and by creating a corporate culture where profitability is rewarded over volume. Execution-wise, we have a clear project governance scheme so that the right resources are allocated to each project while the adequate communication channels will relay relevant information across the Group.",,as_expected,2020,384,

We intend to increase our share of recurring projects with all of our customers by continuing to focus increasing our maintenance service revenues. We intend to extend this strategy to the companies we acquire, including Fidelix, whose strong track record of double-digit margins and large and growing installed base further supports profitability through its aftermarket and cloud businesses. We also plan to maintain a balance between our installation and services businesses and to continue to capitalize on our ability to provide add-on maintenance services following the completion of our installation projects as those tend to be recurring and more predictable by nature.",,as_expected,2020,384,

We believe we have significant experience in identifying, executing and integrating acquisitions while remaining focused on our existing business. We also believe the acquisition of Fidelix will provide us with a platform for further acquisition-led growth, especially given Fidelix’s track-record of successful bolt-on acquisitions. Our focus on technical disciplines allows us to better approach likely targets and provide a compelling view of a common future.

Buildings are increasingly connected and involve smart, interconnected and automated technical systems. This represents a substantial growth opportunity for our business that we strive to take advantage of. In particular, the acquisition of Fidelix brings additional digitalization capabilities across the Group, which we expect to be a driver as we focus on the next-generation of installation across all of our business areas. 119 ----- Digitalization, however, does not only underpin our long-term growth profile, it is also an opportunity to connect construction sites to better inform decision-making and foster a closer collaboration across our teams but also with the various parties which we collaborate with on a construction site. Each of our business areas has dedicated digitalization managers mapping local initiatives and driving local digitalization efforts. Our central steering group involves members from all business areas and prioritizes initiatives according to Assemblin’s digital agenda. Our key successes have historically been on our market leading expertise in Building Information Modelling (“BIM”) where Assemblin has around 16 years of experience. This type of modelling is currently used both in large and small projects, improves clarity to all stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle, and makes it easier to achieve project and business goals.

We believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of growth in the “green economy.” The energy consumption of a building is significantly influenced by the design of its electrical, heating and plumbing, and HVAC systems. As a leading Nordic installer and service provider of those systems, we are able to support customers seeking to optimize energy utilization in both new and existing buildings. We also offer energy efficiency solutions for different types of power distribution. We aim at increasing our revenues attributable to the “green economy” by further developing innovative installation and service offerings in the area of energy efficiency.

Imtech Nordic was in turn the result of acquisitions of a number of leading companies in Nordics with strong reputations in their respective technical disciplines often spanning decades: Š Our Electrical business area dates back to 1931, when Närkes Elektriska, NEA was founded in Örebro. NEA eventually expanded nationwide in Sweden and became a leading actor in electrical installations. Š Our Heating and Sanitation business area’s and Norway business area’s history stretches back to NVS originally founded in 1903 which became one of the leading heating and sanitation actors in the Nordic region, with over 90 offices in Sweden, Norway and Finland. Š Our Ventilation business area has its roots mainly in Sydtotal, a company founded by industry veterans in Malmö in 1999 offering ventilation as a total concept. With Triton as our owner, we have subsequently grown through the acquisition of 38 additional companies (excluding Fidelix), the largest of which being a carve-out from construction company Skanska, Skanska Installation, acquired in 2016. In 2020 and the start of 2021, these acquisitions included businesses with estimated aggregated annual revenues of SEK 696 million, strengthening our footprint across each of our business areas. In addition, in December 2020 we entered into a sale and purchase agreement to acquire Fidelix, a technology-driven building automation service company, which is expected to provide us with a market-leading position within the building automation market in the Nordics.

Our customers range from multi-regional companies to small businesses and property owners and comprise a variety of industries. Š **_Multi-regional construction companies: The Nordic construction market is dominated by several large, multi-regional companies which tend to have complete responsibility over large project deliveries and use installers such as Assemblin as subcontractors.

Š **_Local construction companies: We also work closely with local construction companies in a subcontracting role, primarily focusing our work on project assignments. In the local construction market, strong relationships are essential to maintaining customers and partnerships.

Examples of our customers include the Stockholm County Council, Akademiska Hus, Region Östergötland and Skellefteå Kommun. Š **_Large real-estate developers and property owners: We work with large real-estate developers and property owners who have strong real-estate and construction knowledge. We conduct both project and service assignments in this market. Examples of our customers include Kungsleden, Ikano, Riksbyggen and Centrum Fastigheter.

Depending on the size of the potential project, a tender process can last from a few days to more than a year. By contrast, our service projects are typically based on framework agreements or ongoing relationships. Prior involvement usually offers competitive advantages. Pricing for installation and service projects takes place primarily at the local branch level, with larger projects requiring approval from the Group or the Board. Factors that we typically take into account when pricing installation projects and service assignments may include: (i) the purchase price of materials; (ii) wages and hourly billing of project managers and employees; (iii) subcontractor costs; (iv) price differentiation for volume, geography or competence; (v) the fixed price of subscription agreements (in the service sector); and/or (vi) pricing adjustments relating to the economic cycle and general pricing adjustments.",,as_expected,2020,384,

Where the purchaser remains responsible for design of a project, we act as subcontractor and 127 ----- enter into standard subcontracting arrangements. By contrast, in “turnkey” projects where we act as a main contractor with principal responsibility for the design and execution of a project, our contracts will contain general terms that will allocate different responsibilities between us and the customer. Customer agreements service include individual service agreements for a fixed period, long-term framework agreements (typically without agreed volumes) and oral agreements (in daily operations). Additionally, we typically provide to our customers warranty and support service coverage in each of the countries where we operate. A standard warranty period for customer agreements for installation projects is five years on materials and workmanship from the date of acceptance and approval by the customer. Where applicable, the parties may sometimes agree on longer guarantee periods for special equipment. We often negotiate extension clauses in our supply agreements that provide a warranty period of up to 66 months (in other terms, five and one-half years) where a purchase is made for an installation project. This ensures adequate back-to-back coverage during the standard warranty period. A growing trend is IPD (or Partnering) contract models that have allowed us to be involved at earlier stages in the project and ensure a more flexible pricing model to allow for changes during the course of the project and a common interest in sharing risks and opportunities as they arise. These projects are often larger, more long-term projects and typically, for which we are reimbursed. During this phase we agree the design parameters and pricing in detail together with the customer before the construction contract is signed. The pricing is typically flexible against a total target price with lower margins if the price exceeded and higher margins if the price is held or better.",,as_expected,2020,384,

Additionally, where we can, we pass through the cost of inflation to our customers. We monitor material prices on a continuous basis, and changes in prices are passed through to our customers on a short notice via our pricing manuals (for services and small projects)while our multi-year contracts include index clauses. Our supplier base includes high-quality original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and wholesalers. The largest part of our procurement process involves direct material purchases from selected framework agreement suppliers. Our key manufacturers and distributors are mapped in order to control for benefits and risks; we require all suppliers to follow our Code of Conduct and subject them to routine evaluations.

From a broad perspective, the top management of the Group sets our Code of Conduct, which guides all procurement-related activities. At a more functional level, our material procurement comprises two key players: the central functions within each business area secure favorable terms with suppliers, and then local branch managers act as the ultimate decision makers. The centralized procurement function in each business area enables scale benefits and high-quality materials, while branch level procurement through our digital platforms secures availability and cost efficiency. Each business area has its own procurement function which governs and supports branch level procurement while also negotiating framework agreements with suppliers. The procurement function is responsible for signing, monitoring and reviewing framework agreements. Supplier assessment involves the evaluation of a range of factors including delivery capacity, warranties, product responsibilities, and prices. The procurement function within each business area also designates certain supplies as “Assemblin Best Choice” by collaborating with suppliers and operations to develop and evaluate new materials and products. We aim to offer the highest quality materials and products at a low cost with good availability to customers. In doing so, we limit our “Assemblin Best Choice” designation to only those suppliers who comply with relevant laws and requirements, as well as the requirements set out in our Code of Conduct. The actual procurement of materials is then done locally by branch or project managers, who are also responsible for hiring subcontractors for certain tasks, such as insulation work.

As of and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, the Initial Guarantors represented 90% of our net revenues, 88% of our EBITDA and over 100% of our assets (other than goodwill and shares in subsidiaries), in each case, calculated on a stand-alone basis without giving effect to intergroup eliminations. The obligations of the Guarantors will be contractually limited under the applicable Guarantees to reflect limitations under applicable law with respect to maintenance of share capital, corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance and other legal restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and their respective shareholders, directors and general partners. For a description of such contractual limitations, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the _Notes and the Collateral—The Notes Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability,” “—The Notes Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability” and “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_ A significant portion of the operations of the Issuer will be conducted through its Restricted Subsidiaries.

The Notes and each Guarantee therefore will be effectively subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than the Guarantors). For the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, our Non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries represented approximately 10% of our net revenues, 12% of our EBITDA and none of our assets (other than goodwill and shares in subsidiaries), in each case, calculated on a stand-alone basis without giving effect to intergroup eliminations. On an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions as of September 30, 2020, the Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer that will not guarantee the Notes would have had less than SEK 10 million outstanding financial indebtedness. Although the Indenture limits the incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture does not impose any limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.” 166 ----- In addition, as described below under “—Certain Covenants—Future Guarantees” and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, each Restricted Subsidiary that guarantees the Pension Guarantee Facility, the Super Senior Facilities, Public Debt or certain other indebtedness shall also enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Pension Guarantee Facility, the Super Senior Facilities and the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and similar principles. Each Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes _and the Collateral—The Notes Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability,” “—The Notes Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability” and “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_ The Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and release as described under “Certain Covenants—Release of the _Guarantees.”_",,as_expected,2020,384,

The 144A Global Notes will, on or about the Completion Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream. - Additional Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Note will, on or about the Completion Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream. Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear and Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred. If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000 principal amount, and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under the section “Offering and Transfer Restrictions” in the Offering Memorandum. Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 in principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Definitive Registered Notes: (1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes; (2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be redeemed in part; (3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or (4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) will, at the cost of the Issuer, promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any, provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount that is at least €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. If and so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange and to the extent that the rules and regulations of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any Change of Control Offer. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. The closing date of any such Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control may be changed to conform to the actual closing date of the Change of Control, provided that such closing date is not earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date the Change of Control Offer notice is mailed as described in the second paragraph of this section. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of the conflict. If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third-party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third-party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding the date of redemption. 180 ----- The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control may require a mandatory prepayment of certain Indebtedness. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under certain Indebtedness and may require a mandatory prepayment of such Indebtedness may not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Collateral—We may not be able to _obtain the funds required to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control and the occurrence of certain important corporate events will not constitute a Change of Control.”_ The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Notes.",,as_expected,2020,384,

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant: (1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant; (2) all Indebtedness outstanding on the Original Notes Issue Date under the Super Senior Facilities shall be deemed initially Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant and not the first paragraph or clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of this covenant, and may not be reclassified; (3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included; (4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (7), (11), (15) or (16) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included; (5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof; (6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness; (7) for the purposes of determining “Consolidated EBITDA” (x) pro forma effect shall be given to Consolidated EBITDA on the same basis for calculating the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries and (y) in relation to clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant, Consolidated EBITDA shall be measured on the most recent date on which new commitments are obtained (in the case of revolving facilities) or the date on which new Indebtedness is Incurred (in the case of term facilities) and for the period of the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters ending prior to such date for which such internal consolidated financial statements of the Issuer are available; and (8) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS. Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” Except as otherwise specified, the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (b) the principal amount, or 184 ----- liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness. For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness Incurred under a Credit Facility, reborrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to “cash sweep” provisions or any similar provisions under a Credit Facility that provide that Indebtedness is deemed to be repaid daily (or otherwise periodically), including any revolving indebtedness, shall only be deemed for purposes of this covenant to have been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on the date of any subsequent reborrowing thereof. If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant). For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or, at the option of the Issuer, first committed, in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that; (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable eurodenominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded, so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the definition of Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Original Notes Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Original Notes Issue Date; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to the euro) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in euro will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor will incur any Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt) that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor unless such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and the applicable Guarantee, if any, on substantially identical terms; provided, however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured with different collateral or by virtue of being secured on a junior priority basis or by virtue of the application of waterfall or other payment ordering provisions affecting different tranches of Indebtedness. No Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured on a first or junior Lien basis.",,as_expected,2020,384,

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and no action taken prior to the Reversion Date will constitute a Default or Event of Default. The “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the Indenture but not during the continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Original Notes Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” In addition, the Indenture also permits, without causing a Default or Event of Default, the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any contractual commitments or take actions in the future after any date on which the Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long as the contractual commitments were entered into during the Suspension Event and not in anticipation of the Notes no longer having an Investment Grade Status. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes that the conditions set forth in the first paragraph under this caption has been satisfied, _provided that, no such notification shall be a condition for the suspension or reversion of the covenants described_ under this caption to be effective.

The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and similar principles. By virtue of such limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. The validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in “Risk Factors” and “Limitations on Validity and _Enforceability of the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” in the Offering_ Memorandum. 202 -----",,as_expected,2020,384,

Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Trustee will have no obligation to monitor compliance by the Issuer with the Indenture. The Indenture provides that if a Default occurs and is continuing and a responsible officer of the Trustee is informed in writing in accordance with the terms of the Indenture of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Indenture provides that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture. The Indenture provides for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured (including by way of pre-funding) to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.",,as_expected,2020,384,

This summary deals only with initial purchasers of Temporary Notes at the “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of Temporary Notes is sold for money, excluding sales to underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) in the initial offering that are U.S. Holders, that receive such Additional Notes in exchange for such Temporary Notes, and that will hold the Notes as capital assets. The discussion does not cover all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to, or the actual tax effect that any of the matters described herein will have on, the acquisition, ownership or disposition of Notes by particular investors (including consequences under the alternative minimum tax or net investment income tax), and does not address any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. This summary also does not discuss all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to certain types of investors subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws (such as financial institutions, insurance companies, individual retirement accounts and other tax-deferred accounts, tax-exempt organizations, dealers in securities or currencies, investors that will hold the Notes as part of straddles, hedging transactions or conversion transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes, persons that have ceased to be U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents of the United States, investors holding the Notes in connection with a trade or business conducted outside of the United States, U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents living abroad or investors whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar). As used herein, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of Notes that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax without regard to its source or (iv) a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or the trust has validly elected to be treated as a domestic trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes that holds Notes will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Prospective purchasers that are entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes should consult their tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences to them and their partners of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of Notes by the partnership. This summary is based on the tax laws of the United States including the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations thereunder, published rulings and court decisions, all as of the date hereof and all subject to change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect.",,as_expected,2020,384,

Upon the exchange of the Temporary Notes as described in “Description of the Temporary Notes,” the Issuer will issue €100.0 million aggregate principal amount of Additional Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2025 (the “Additional Notes”). The Issuer will issue the Additional Notes under an indenture dated December 6, 2019 (the “Indenture”), between, inter alios, the Issuer, Deutsche Trustee Company Limited, as trustee (the “Trustee”), and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as security agent (the “Security Agent”) and as paying agent pursuant to which the Issuer issued €250.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2025 (the “Original Notes” and, together with the Additional Notes, the “Notes”). The Additional Notes will vote as a single class with the Original Notes for all purposes under the Indenture (including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase). The Indenture has not been qualified under, does not incorporate or include, by reference or otherwise, and is not subject to, any of the provisions of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. The proceeds of the offering of the Temporary Notes sold on the Issue Date (and exchanged on or about the Completion Date for an equal aggregate principal amount of Additional Notes) will be used to pay the cash consideration for the Target in connection with the Fidelix Acquisition, to pay transaction costs associated with the Transactions and to fund cash on balance sheet, including potential acquisitions, as set forth in the Offering Memorandum under the caption “Use of Proceeds.” The Indenture is unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which €100.0 million aggregate principal amount of Additional Notes will be issued in this Offering and €250.0 million was issued as the Original Notes on the Original Notes Issue Date. We may, subject to applicable law, issue an unlimited principal amount of subsequent additional Notes having identical terms and conditions as the Notes (the “Subsequent Additional Notes”); provided that, if the Subsequent Additional Notes are not fungible with either the Original Notes or the Additional Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such Subsequent Additional Notes will be issued with a separate ISIN code or common code, as applicable, from the Original Notes or the Additional Notes, as applicable. We will only be permitted to issue Subsequent Additional Notes in compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture, including the covenant restricting the Incurrence of Indebtedness (as described below under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”). Except with respect to right of payment and optional redemption, and as otherwise provided for in the Indenture, the Additional Notes issued in this Offering, the Original Notes and, if issued, any Subsequent Additional Notes, will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Unless the context otherwise requires, in this “Description of the Notes,” references to the “Notes” include the Original Notes, the Additional Notes and any Subsequent Additional Notes that are actually issued. The Indenture is subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and will be subject to any Additional Intercreditor Agreements (each as defined below). The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the terms and ranking of the Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes. See “Description of _Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” for a description of the material terms of the_ Intercreditor Agreement. This “Description of the Notes” is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Notes, the Indenture and the Security Documents, and it refers to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Since this description of the terms of the Notes is only a summary, you should refer to the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents for complete descriptions of the obligations of the Issuer and your rights. Copies of the Indenture are available from us upon request. The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered Holders will have rights under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to enforcement and the pursuit of other remedies.

Individuals who sell their Notes, or have their Notes redeemed or bought back, are_ subject to capital gains tax. The tax rate is 30%. The capital gain or loss is calculated as the difference between the sales (or redemption) proceeds, after deduction of sales costs, and the Notes’ acquisition cost for tax purposes. The acquisition cost is determined according to the “average method.” This means that the acquisition value for all Notes of the same class and type shall be added together and computed collectively, with respect to changes to the holding. Gains or losses on currency exchange rate fluctuations may arise in relation to Notes where the sales proceeds received are in a foreign currency. However, no special calculations are required if the sales proceeds are exchanged into SEK within 30 days from the time of disposal. In such case, the exchange rate on the date of exchange shall be used when calculating the value of the sales proceeds. The exchange rate on the date of acquisition is generally used when determining the acquisition cost for tax purposes. As a general rule, 70% of a capital loss is deductible against any other taxable income from capital. However, capital losses on listed Swedish receivables are fully deductible in the income from capital category. According to Swedish case law, full deductibility also applies to capital losses on listed foreign receivables. If a net loss arises in the income from capital category, a reduction of the tax on income from employment and from business operations, as well as the tax on real estate and the municipal real estate fee, is allowed. The tax reduction is 30% of any part of the net loss not exceeding SEK 100,000 and 21% of any part of the net loss in excess of SEK 100,000. An excess net loss may not be carried forward to a subsequent fiscal year. _Interest. Any interest income received by an individual Noteholder is subject to Swedish tax at a tax rate of 30%_ in the income from capital category. Interest income is taxable when the income can be disposed of. _Withholding of tax on interest. The legal entity effecting an interest payment to an individual (or an estate of a_ deceased individual) will normally be required to withhold Swedish preliminary tax (Sw. preliminärskatt). The preliminary tax withheld is normally equal to the final tax on the interest income, which means that there is generally no further tax payable on the interest. 252 -----",,as_expected,2020,384,

Under domestic tax rules, an individual is resident in Sweden for Swedish tax purposes if he/she (i) is domiciled in Sweden; (ii) has permanently stayed in Sweden; or (iii) has been domiciled earlier in Sweden and, after having moved abroad, continues to have an essential connection to Sweden. A limited liability company is generally deemed to be resident in Sweden if it is incorporated in Sweden under Swedish corporate laws. A foreign company is deemed to have a permanent establishment in Sweden in case it has a fixed place of business through which the business of the company is wholly or partly carried on. Swedish withholding tax, or Swedish tax deduction, is not imposed on payments of any principal amount or any amount that is considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes to a non-resident holder of Notes.

For both corporate and individual holders of Notes who are residents of Norway for tax purposes_ (“Norwegian Holders”) interest received on the Notes is taxable as “ordinary income” subject to tax at a flat tax rate of 22%. For Norwegian Holders holding Notes issued with a discount (compared to the nominal value) such discount will be taxed in the year of the realization of the Notes. If the Notes are not listed on a regulated market within six months following issuance, Norwegian Holders who are individuals will be subject to additional Norwegian taxes on the interest received at a flat tax rate of 22%. The basis for the additional tax is equal to the interest accrued on the Notes reduced by the tax rate of 22% and less a risk free interest rate (Nw. skjermingsfradrag). This amount is then multiplied with a factor of 1.44 in order to find the taxable amount. The risk free interest rate is determined by the Norwegian Ministry of Finance based on the interest rate published by Norges Bank on a bi-monthly basis. Any interest received in foreign currency is converted to Norwegian kroner when calculating the taxable interest income. If certain requirements are met, Norwegian Holders may be entitled to a tax credit in Norwegian taxes for withholding tax imposed on the interest in the jurisdiction where the issuer (being the debtor) is resident for tax purposes. _Capital gains and losses. Sale, disposal or other redemption of the Notes is treated as a realization of such Notes_ and will trigger a capital gain or loss for Norwegian Holders. Capital gains will be taxable as ordinary income for both individual and corporate Norwegian Holders, subject to the flat tax rate of 22%. Losses will be deductible from a Norwegian Holder’s ordinary income, which is taxed at the same rate. Any capital gain or loss is calculated for each Note, and is computed as the difference between the amount received by the Norwegian Holder on realization and the Norwegian Holder’s cost price of the Notes. The cost price is equal to the price for which the Norwegian Holder acquired the Notes, including costs incurred in connection with the acquisition and realization of the Notes. Any gain received in foreign currency when realizing Notes is converted to Norwegian kroner when calculating the taxable gain. If the Norwegian Holder owns Notes acquired at different points in time, the Notes that were acquired first will be regarded as the first to be disposed of, on a first-in first-out basis. The Norwegian tax treatment of the exchange from Temporary Notes to Additional Notes is not free from doubt, as there is no clear tax precedent regarding such transactions. If the exchange is considered a realization of the Temporary Notes, this may result in a taxable gain / loss for Norwegian Holders. The taxable gain will then be calculated based on the value of the Additional Notes received, including any interest and currency effects. Please see the sections above regarding the tax implications connected to realization of Notes. Norwegian Holders should consult their tax advisers regarding the Norwegian tax consequences of the exchange of Temporary Notes to Additional Notes. _Net wealth tax. Norwegian Holders that are individuals are subject to Norwegian net wealth taxation. The value_ of the Notes held by an individual Norwegian Holder at the end of each income year is included in the basis for the computation of net wealth tax. Currently, the marginal net wealth tax rate is 0.85% of the value assessed. The value for assessment purposes for listed Notes is the listed value as of January 1 in the year of assessment (in other words, the year following the relevant income year). The tax value of unlisted Notes is equal to the presumed market value of the Notes as of January 1 in the year of assessment.

The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to purchase Temporary Notes from the Issuer, are several and not joint. The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Temporary Notes for resale at the issue price that appears on the cover of this offering memorandum for the Temporary Notes. After the initial Offering, the Initial Purchasers may change the Offering’s price for the Temporary Notes and any other selling terms without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell Temporary Notes in the United States through certain of their affiliates or through United States registered broker dealers. In the Purchase Agreement, we have agreed that: Š the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the relevant Temporary Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain opinions of counsel; Š during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including the date that is 90 days after such date, none of the Issuer, the Guarantors or any of their subsidiaries or other affiliates will offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt (including, without limitation, any debt securities, loans or other debt instruments), issued or guaranteed by any of the Issuer or the Guarantors and having a tenor of more than one year (other than the Additional Notes issued in exchange for the Temporary Notes); and Š the Issuer and the relevant Guarantors will indemnify the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and/or will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may be required to make in respect of those liabilities. Š the Issuer has agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for their services in connection with the Offering and to reimburse them for certain out-of-pocket expenses. Persons who purchase Temporary Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the issue price set forth on the cover page hereof. Certain affiliates of the Issuer may purchase a portion of the Temporary Notes in the Offering. The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has agreed that the Temporary Notes may not be offered or sold within the United States except pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act or in transactions not subject to those registration requirements, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S. In addition, until 40 days following the later of (i) the commencement of the Offering and (ii) the Issue Date, an offer or sale of Temporary Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act unless the dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or another exemption from registration under the Securities Act. During this 40-day period, neither Clearstream nor Euroclear will monitor compliance by dealers with the Securities Act. Nordea Bank Abp’s ability to engage in U.S. securities dealings is limited under the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act and it may not offer or sell securities that are offered or sold in the United States. Nordea Bank Abp will only offer and sell the securities that are part of its allotment solely outside of the United States. The Temporary Notes and the Additional Notes are each a new issue of securities, and there is currently no established trading market for the Temporary Notes or the Additional Notes. In addition, the Temporary Notes and the Additional Notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Transfer _Restrictions.” We do not intend to apply for the Temporary Notes or the Additional Notes to be listed on any_ securities exchange other than the Official List of the Exchange or to arrange for the Temporary Notes or the 256 ----- Additional Notes to be quoted on any quotation system. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Temporary Notes and the Additional Notes, but they are not obligated to do so. The Initial Purchasers may discontinue any market making in the Temporary Notes and the Additional Notes at any time in their sole discretion. In addition, such market making activities will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and other applicable legal requirements. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid trading market will develop for the Temporary Notes or the Additional Notes, that you will be able to sell your Notes at a particular time or that the prices that you receive when you sell will be favorable. In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers may engage in overallotment, stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the Offering size, which creates a short position for the Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the Temporary Notes or the Additional Notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Temporary Notes and the Additional Notes, as applicable. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the Temporary Notes or the Additional Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions may cause the price of the Temporary Notes or the Additional Notes, as applicable, to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of those transactions. If the Initial Purchasers engage in stabilizing or syndicate covering transactions, they may discontinue them at any time. It is expected that delivery of the Temporary Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the date specified on the cover page of this offering memorandum, which will be the ten business day following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+10”). Under Rule 15(c)6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Temporary Notes on the date of pricing or the next seven successive business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Temporary Notes initially will settle in T+10, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement.

1629,Final Offerings 2020.md,137,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS,137.1,European Union,137.1.1,,"The Guarantors in Sweden and Norway are organized under the European Economic Area. Pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) no. 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), which applies within the E.U., other than Denmark, the courts of the Member State in which a company’s “center of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, “COMI”) is situated has jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings. The determination of where a company has its COMI is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. Although there is a presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that a company has its COMI in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary, Preamble 13 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the COMI of a debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and “is therefore ascertainable by third parties.” The courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in determining the COMI of a company, including, in particular, where board meetings are held, the location at which the company conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location at which the majority of the company’s creditors are established. A company’s COMI may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition. The EU Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings that are collective insolvency proceedings of the types referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. If the COMI of a company is in one Member State (other than Denmark) under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open territorial insolvency proceedings against that company only if such company has an “establishment” in the territory of such other Member State. An “establishment” is defined to mean a place of operations at which the company carries on non-transitory economic activity with human means and goods. The effects of those insolvency proceedings opened in that other Member State are restricted to the assets of the company situated in such other Member State. Where main proceedings have been opened in the Member State in which the company has its COMI, any proceedings opened subsequently in another Member State in which the company has an establishment (secondary proceedings) are limited to “winding-up proceedings” listed in Annex B of the EU Insolvency Regulation. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the company has its COMI have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can only be opened in another Member State in which the company has an establishment where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the Member State in which the company’s COMI is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of a creditor that is domiciled, habitually resident or has its registered office in the other Member State or whose claim arises from the operation of the establishment. The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court opening main proceedings which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no territorial proceedings have been opened there. The liquidator appointed by a court in a Member State that has jurisdiction to open main proceedings (because the company’s COMI is there) may exercise the powers conferred on him or her by the law of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of the company from that other Member 259 ----- State) subject to certain limitations so long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other Member State or any preservation measures taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other Member State in which the company has assets. Further to the above, according to the Nordic Bankruptcy Convention of 7 November 1933 (the “Nordic Bankruptcy Convention”) a bankruptcy opened in Sweden, Norway or Finland comprises all assets and liabilities that a bankruptcy debtor possesses also in any other of these countries, and the bankruptcy administrator is authorized to dispose of all the assets of the bankruptcy, regardless of in which of such countries the assets are located. Moreover, the Nordic Bankruptcy Convention stipulates that the law of the Nordic country in which the insolvency proceedings are opened (lex concursus) is applicable unless any specific exception is stated in the Nordic Bankruptcy Convention.",,as_expected,2020,384,

In the event of bankruptcy, the court will appoint a receiver (Sw. konkursförvaltare) in bankruptcy who will work in the interest of all creditors with the objective of realizing the debtor’s assets and distribute the proceeds among the creditors. The purpose of bankruptcy proceedings is to wind up the company in such a way that the company’s creditors receive as high a proportion of their claims as possible. The receiver in bankruptcy is required to safeguard the assets and can decide to continue the business or to close it down, depending on what is best for all creditors. In general, the receiver in bankruptcy is required to sell the assets of the debtor as soon as possible and to distribute the proceeds. In the interim, the receiver will take over the management and control of the company and the company’s directors and/or managing director will no longer be entitled to represent the company or dispose of the company’s assets. When distributing the proceeds, the receiver must follow the mandatory provisions of the Swedish Rights of Priority Act (Sw. förmånsrättslagen (1970:979)), as amended from time to time, that states the order in which creditors have a right to be paid. As a general principle, in bankruptcy proceedings competing claims have equal right to payment in relation to the size of the amount claimed from the debtor’s assets. In case of enforcement outside of bankruptcy proceedings in respect of certain types of assets, such as over shares, receivables, bank accounts, trademarks and contractual rights, enforcement can be carried out by the security holder itself. A provision granting the secured party or its agent such right of enforcement is typically included in any pledge agreement between the pledgor and the secured party or its agent. The secured party is typically entitled to enforce the security through a sale of the collateral. However, certain restrictions apply to the procedure for such a sale. In general, when enforcing the security, the secured party is under a duty of care in relation to the security provider and the security granted. The security provider should, if the circumstances are not exceptional, be given prior notice of the contemplated enforcement and also of the time and location of the sale. Furthermore, sufficient notice should be given to prospective purchasers in order to create reasonable preconditions for a market price being obtained in the sale. Where the secured party has been granted the right to enforce the security through a private sale, such sale must be made to a party unaffiliated with the secured party unless the market price of the security can be independently and objectively established and the security is sold at such price. Pledges over receivables and other claims are, if the receivable or claim has fallen due, normally enforced through the secured party collecting the payment as opposed to selling the receivable. 260 ----- Enforcement of security in bankruptcy is also subject to certain restrictions. A secured party holding a possessory pledge over movable property (such as shares) may arrange for the sale of the movable property at a public auction. Such secured party must however give the receiver in bankruptcy an opportunity to arrange payment of the debtor’s debt to the creditor in order to redeem the movable property to the bankruptcy estate, and the movable property may not, without the consent of the receiver in bankruptcy, be sold earlier than four weeks after the oath administration meeting (Sw. edgångssammanträde) held as a part of the bankruptcy proceedings. However, financial instruments, currency and, under certain circumstances, gold, are exempt from this requirement. The secured party may either sell such financial instruments, currency or gold immediately or assume ownership (against reduction of the secured debt with the market value of such assets or, if the market value of the assets exceeds the outstanding debt, against repayment to the debtor of the surplus), provided that the realization is done in a commercially viable manner. Should the security granted consist of rights over unlisted shares in a subsidiary of the debtor, the receiver in bankruptcy must still be given an opportunity to redeem the shares prior to the sale or deduction.",,as_expected,2020,384,

Furthermore, if a Swedish limited liability company provides any guarantee without receiving sufficient corporate benefit in return, such guarantee will, in whole or in part, be considered a distribution of assets, which will be lawful only to the extent (i) there is sufficient coverage for the unrestricted equity capital of the Swedish limited liability company after the distribution (in other words, at the time the guarantee is provided) (where the aggregate amount available for distribution during the period from the annual general meeting until the following year’s annual general meeting shall be calculated on the basis of the balance sheet approved by the shareholders at the first annual general meeting, taking into account changes in the restricted equity capital after such annual general meeting) and (ii) if it is considered prudent by a Swedish Obligor to undertake the value transfer after having taken into consideration the equity requirements imposed by the nature, scope and risks relating to its business or such Swedish Obligor’s need to strengthen its balance sheet, liquidity or financial position. Where the Swedish limited liability company is a parent company, the latter assessment is also made on a group level. It should also be noted that laws relating to financial assistance in Sweden prohibit limited liability companies incorporated in Sweden from providing guarantees or other credit support for obligations of any person where such obligations are being incurred for the purpose of acquiring shares in the company itself or any of its group companies (with the exception of its subsidiaries).

A petition for company reorganization may be presented by (i) the debtor or (ii) a creditor of the debtor. Corporate reorganization proceedings shall, as a main rule, terminate within three months from commencement but may under certain conditions be extended for up to one year. An administrator (Sw. rekonstruktör) is appointed by the court and supervises the day-to-day activities and safeguards the interests of creditors as well as the debtor. However, the debtor remains in full possession of the business except that, for important decisions such as paying a debt that has fallen due prior to the order of reorganization, granting security for a debt that arose prior to the order, undertaking new obligations or transferring, pledging or granting rights in respect of assets of a substantial value for the business, the consent of the administrator is required. However, the absence of such consent does not affect the validity of the transaction (but may jeopardize the reorganization). Upon the opening of corporate reorganization proceedings, the administrator must notify the creditors of the reorganization proceedings and will draw up a reorganization plan specifying the proposed action to be taken to resolve the company’s difficulties. A creditors’ meeting will be held at which the creditors will be given the opportunity to express their opinions as to whether the reorganization should continue. Upon the request of any of the creditors, the court shall appoint a creditors’ committee composed of a maximum of three persons. The administrator shall, if possible, consult with the creditors’ committee prior to taking any important decisions. The making of an order under the Swedish Reorganization Act does not have the effect of terminating contracts with the debtor and, during the reorganization procedure, the debtor’s business activities continue in the ordinary course of business. However, the procedure includes a suspension of payments to creditors and the debtor cannot pay a debt that fell due prior to the order without the consent of the administrator and such consent may only be granted should there be exceptional reasons for doing so and any petition for bankruptcy in respect of the debtor will be stayed. A moratorium also applies to execution in respect of a claim or enforcement of security during corporate reorganization proceedings unless the security assets are in the physical possession of the secured creditor or any agent acting on behalf of such creditor, which is the case with a Swedish law pledge over the shares in a Swedish limited liability company where the share certificates of such company has been delivered to the agent. The debtor may apply to the court requesting public composition proceedings (Sw. offentligt ackord) which means that the amount of a creditor’s claim may be reduced on a percentage basis. The proposal for a public composition must meet certain requirements such as (i) that a sufficient proportion of the creditors which are allowed to vote and (ii) that such creditors represent a sufficient proportion of the total outstanding claims, vote in favor of such public composition proposal. Creditors with set-off rights and secured creditors will not participate in the composition unless they wholly or partly waive their set-off rights or priority rights. Should the security not cover a secured creditor’s full claim, the remaining claim will, however, be part of a composition. A creditors’ meeting is convened to vote on the proposed composition. The public composition is binding on all creditors that were entitled to participate, meaning that creditors who have not attended the creditors’ meeting will also be bound. However, the obligations of a guarantor under a guarantee provided in respect of a creditor’s claim which has been reduced by way of public composition will not be reduced correspondingly but will remain valid up to the original amount of such creditor’s claim.",,as_expected,2020,384,

Section 8-7 of the Norwegian Companies Acts restricts a Norwegian limited liability company from granting credit to, guaranteeing or providing security for the obligations of, its (direct and indirect) shareholders (or any 263 ----- affiliates of its shareholders) beyond its distributable reserves (free equity) and then, only if adequate security is provided in favor of the company’s repayment/recourse claim against that shareholder or affiliate. Whether the provision of credit, guarantee or security is in compliance with the Norwegian Companies Acts has to be determined at the time such credit, guarantee or security is provided. The above restrictions in Section 8-7 of the Norwegian Companies Acts are, however, subject to exceptions and pursuant to such exception the restrictions does not apply to any credit, guarantee or security for the obligations of (i) its direct or indirect Norwegian parent company and its Norwegian and foreign subsidiaries, provided that the parent company is a Norwegian limited liability company or (ii) its direct or indirect foreign parent company and its Norwegian and foreign subsidiaries, provided that the parent company has decisive influence over the company (meaning, it typically owns more than 50% of the shares in the company) and that the credit, guarantee or security has been made in the “financial interest of the group.” This exception is fairly new, and how it shall be interpreted and practiced is therefore still somewhat uncertain. However, the general perception in Norway seems to be that the term “the group’s financial interests” covers quite a wide range of transactions, but that for instance transactions whose main purpose is to benefit the shareholders of the parent company and not the group (such as dividend recap-transactions and the like), will not be covered by this exception. Pursuant to the preparatory works of the Norwegian Companies Acts, this condition will not be satisfied if funds from a Norwegian Obligor are being utilized to the benefit of the group’s ultimate shareholders (for example, financing distributions to the owners). In addition to the restrictions with respect to upstream and cross-stream loans, guarantees and security outlined above, Section 8-10 of the Norwegian Companies Acts restricts a Norwegian limited liability company from granting any financial assistance (in other words, making assets available, granting credit or providing guarantees or security) in connection with the acquisition of shares in itself or its direct or indirect parent company, and these restrictions apply irrespective of whether the company whose shares are being acquired is a Norwegian or a foreign company. In order for such financial assistance to be valid and binding, the financial exposure of the Norwegian company cannot exceed the amount which the company has available for distribution of dividends to its shareholders (free equity), and the financial assistance must also be granted according to “ordinary commercial terms and principles.” Following certain amendments to the Norwegian Companies Acts that were introduced on January 1, 2020, the limitation of financial assistance to the amount of the Norwegian company’s free equity does not apply for Norwegian private limited liability companies if (i) the acquirer of the shares is domiciled in the European Economic Area and (ii) the Norwegian company is, or will following the acquisition, form part of the same group as the acquirer (in other words, be controlled by the acquirer following the acquisition). In addition, Section 8-10 provides that for a Norwegian company to grant financial assistance its board of directors must issue a report (Nw. redegjørelse) where it makes an assessment of the creditworthiness of the beneficiary of the financial assistance (meaning, the acquirer), and also gives an account of the background and the terms of the financial assistance in question. The board report must also include a declaration to the effect that (1) it will be in the interest of the company to grant the financial assistance, and (2) that the company will have sufficient equity and liquidity as required by the Norwegian Companies Acts when taking the financial assistance into account. Further, the report must address the requirement of the financial assistance being granted on ordinary commercial terms, typically by way of the target company receiving some kind of consideration for providing the financial support (for example, guarantee commission or similar from the acquirer). The financial assistance must thereafter be approved by a majority representing at least two-thirds of both the votes and share capital represented at the general meeting of shareholders of the Norwegian company. Finally, the minutes of the general meeting and the board report need to be filed with the Norwegian Business Register (Nw. Foretaksregisteret) before the financial assistance can be provided. The Norwegian Companies Acts restricts financial assistance made “in connection with” the acquisition of shares, which may also cover financial assistance after completion of the acquisition (such as the refinancing of an acquisition loan facility or the subsequent merger of the target company and the acquiring entity). There must, however, be sufficient connection both in time and as regards other circumstances surrounding such assistance for it to be in contravention of Section 8-10. Section 8-10 explicitly states that the restrictions on financial assistance does not apply to other distributions made in accordance with the Norwegian Companies Acts, such as distributions by way of dividends, group contributions or share capital reductions. 264 ----- The issue of corporate benefit may in some situations impose a restriction on a Norwegian limited liability company’s possibility to offer a guarantee and/or provide security to shareholders in addition to the restrictions described above. Norwegian law does not have a “clear and well-defined” corporate benefit principle (stating that transactions that do not sufficiently coincide with the interest or are to the benefit of the company may be challenged), as you find in many other jurisdictions. Having said that, there are several provisions in the Norwegian Companies Acts, whose main purpose are to ensure that shareholders and other related parties, board members, creditors etc., do not get what may be considered an unreasonable benefit at the expense of the Norwegian company (normally referred to as “abuse of lawful authority”) and/or secure maximum profits/return for the company and its shareholders. Financial assistance, guarantees or security infringing the limitations set out in Sections 8-7 and Section 8-10 of the Norwegian Companies Acts may be declared void if challenged and may give rise to directors’ liability issues. If a credit, guarantee or security is provided in contravention of these rules, any funds paid out will have to be repaid to the company. Typically, the financial assistance restrictions set out in Sections 8-7 and 8-10 are dealt with by including so-called “limitation language” in the relevant finance documents (to the effect that the Norwegian limited liability company only guarantees and secures the relevant obligations to the extent the same would not be in breach of those restrictions).",,as_expected,2020,384,

Although it is not possible for a Norwegian company to provide a fixed or floating charge over all its present and future assets, Norwegian law provides for effectively creating security over a range of closely defined asset types. For example, floating charges may be established over certain asset types of a Norwegian company. As a main rule, a secured creditor does not have a general step-in right to security assets in an enforcement situation and agreements on enforcement cannot validly be entered into prior to the occurrence of an event of default. Instead, enforcement must be sought through the Norwegian courts and/or the Norwegian enforcement authorities. However, this is different for financial instruments, such as shares in a Norwegian limited liability company. If the secured party is a financial institution or bond trustee, the shares are considered financial collateral, and the parties are free (within reasonable limits) to agree on the enforcement process in the share pledge agreement. Also, for specific security assets, and under certain circumstances, a creditor may take possession or directly enforce its rights upon enforcement. This is the case for security established over receivables (such as trade receivables or bank account claims) whereby the secured party may instruct the relevant debtor to pay the outstanding amounts directly to the secured party instead of to the chargor. The concept of a security trustee, as it is understood under common law, does not exist under Norwegian law. In practice, in an arrangement with a security agent acting on behalf of the secured parties, as these exist from time to time, it is generally recognized under Norwegian law that the security agent will be able to enforce the security on behalf of the secured parties and apply any proceeds to the secured parties. In order to commence any legal action regarding a claim (for enforcement purposes or otherwise) against the debtor the security agent may, however, be required to disclose to the court the identity of the creditors and have the creditors join in or participate as claimants in the proceedings. It has been established by the Norwegian Supreme Court that a bond trustee for an undisclosed number of bondholders can, based on the provisions in the bond agreement, take legal action against the issuer on behalf of and in lieu of the bondholders and without having to disclose the entity of the bondholders.",,as_expected,2020,384,

Norwegian insolvency legislation (save for the provisional Norwegian Reconstruction Act described below) prioritize the timely recovery and realization of underlying assets, rather than the rescue of the company/debtor as such, and generally follow internationally recognized standards with: (i) a seizure and subsequent disposal of debtor’s assets, (ii) assessment and ranking of claims, (iii) testing and revocation of transactions made prior to bankruptcy, and (iv) continued operation of the company at the risk of, and (in practice) only if guaranteed by, creditors. 265 ----- Norwegian bankruptcy proceedings are opened following a petition from a creditor or the debtor itself to the local court where the debtor has its headquarters. The court will request a cash deposit of NOK 58,600 (as of 2020) from the petitioning creditor (does not apply to the debtor or employee-initiated bankruptcy) to secure court fees and basic costs related to the proceedings. The court reviews whether the procedural and material requirements for opening the procedures are fulfilled. A petition from a creditor will be served on the debtor, and a court hearing will take place within two or three weeks after the petition has been filed with the court. The court will, pre-judicially, review any objections the debtor might have to the petition (for example, whether the creditor holds a valid claim or the debtor’s possible counterclaim, among others). The creditor has to prove by a high degree of probability both (i) that the creditor holds valid claim that is due for payment and (ii) that the debtor is insolvent. There are two requirements for a debtor to be deemed to be insolvent. The debtor must (i) be unable to service its debt as it becomes due, such payment difficulties not being of a temporary nature and (ii) the debtor must be in deficit (the company’s debts must exceed the sum of its assets and revenue, based on real, not book, values). The bankrupt company will be controlled by the court appointed liquidator (generally a lawyer). The liquidator is often assisted and supervised by a creditors’ committee, also appointed by the court. A liquidator would be in control of the company’s property following insolvency and the liquidator will generally adhere to the wishes of the secured creditor as the liquidator’s main purpose is to dispose of the property. The general task of the liquidator is to turn all assets into cash in the manner assumed to be most profitable for the estate (the creditors) and then distribute the available cash to the creditors. All the company’s assets will in practice be seized and the debtor may not dispose of the seized assets in any way while the bankruptcy proceedings are ongoing. The liquidator can decide that the business will continue to trade only if this is regarded as being in the best interest of the estate as such. New debt incurred by the estate will be regarded as preferential debts. The liquidator will therefore normally seek to obtain guarantees from creditors in favor of the estate (to cover debts to suppliers, etc.). Secured creditors are, in principle, not deemed to be part of the bankruptcy proceedings to the extent the value of the security is sufficient to cover the underlying obligations of the debtor. The secured creditors may, in principle, realize the security, and cover their claims, however, keeping in mind that the realization of a number of categories of security during the first six months after the opening of a bankruptcy will be subject to the approval of the bankruptcy estate (the same principles apply to official debt negotiations). The bankruptcy estate has the right, subject to certain conditions being fulfilled, to realize the security with a wiping out effect on unmet liens and divide the proceeds between the secured creditors and other holding legal rights in the assets. Furthermore, the bankruptcy estate has a statutory first lien of up to 5% of the estimated value or sales value of all assets (except financial collateral) secured by the debtor for its own debt or by a third-party for the debtor’s indebtedness. In Norwegian bankruptcies, the creditors will be paid according to the following priority: (i) secured claims (are covered to the extent of the value of the secured asset; any remaining balance is “transferred” to “ordinary claims”); (ii) claims which arise during the bankruptcy proceedings, liquidators’ costs, obligations of the estate; (iii) salary claims (within certain limitations); (iv) tax claims (for example, withholding tax and VAT within certain limitations); (v) ordinary claims (pari passu: unsecured debt, trade creditors, indemnity claims etc.); and (vi) subordinated debt. Pursuant to the Norwegian Recovery Act, the bankruptcy estate may be entitled to set aside or reverse transactions carried out in the three to twelve-month period (and, in respect of transactions in favor of related parties, up to two years) before the opening of the bankruptcy, such as extraordinary payments of certain creditors, security established for existing debt and transactions at an under-value. The bankruptcy estate may also, under certain circumstances, be entitled to set aside or reverse transactions made in bad faith or negligently 266 ----- which in an improper manner increase the debtor’s debt, favor one or more creditors at the expense of others or deprive the debtor of assets which may otherwise have served to cover the creditors’ claims, in which case the time limit for challenges by the estate is increased to 10 years.",,as_expected,2020,384,

Reconstruction is a law regulated “instrument” by which the debtor may seek bankruptcy protection and protection from debt recovery proceedings, with the aim to reorganize the business and reach a composition agreement with the creditors. The reconstruction proceedings are regulated by the Norwegian Reconstruction Act, replacing, subject to certain exceptions, Part I of the Norwegian Bankruptcy Act for as long as the Reconstruction Act remains in effect. Reconstruction proceedings may be initiated by the courts after petition from the debtor or, on certain conditions, from creditors (but may not be instituted against the will of the debtor). In order for the courts to open reconstruction proceedings, the debtor must be encountering, or will in the foreseeable future encounter, severe financial difficulties. If the petition is granted, the Court shall appoint a reconstructor (who shall be an insolvency lawyer) and a creditors committee (the “Reconstruction Committee”). The key feature of the reconstruction proceedings is that all creditor collection steps are suspended, in particular: Š Payment of all pre-petition debt is suspended Š The debtor is protected from creditor initiated bankruptcy and debt recovery and enforcement proceedings while the debtor’s business is being reconstructed Š The debtor’s business is under the supervision of the Reconstruction Committee The aim of the proceedings is in essence a reconstruction of the debtor’s business and to reduce the risk of unnecessary bankruptcy of viable businesses. The Reconstruction Act distinguishes between voluntary composition and compulsory composition. A voluntary composition may in principle include any possible arrangement or composition. However, it requires an approval from each and every one of the creditors, and is only binding on those creditors who have participated in the composition (for example, not on “unknown” creditors). In a compulsory reconstruction, there are limitations with respect to the contents of the proposal. It is however binding on the minority of creditors, and also on unknown creditors. Pursuant to the Reconstruction Act a voluntarily reconstruction may include (and a compulsory composition can only include) a: (i) moratorium; (ii) percentage reduction of the debt; (iii) full or partial conversion of debt to equity (only applicable to consenting creditors); (iv) transfer of all or parts of the debtor’s business and assets, without liquidation; (v) transfer and liquidation of all or parts of the debtor’s business and assets, discharging the debtor of the obligations not covered by the liquidation; or (vi) a combination of the above mentioned measures. The proposed composition, together with the recommendation from the Reconstruction Committee, is distributed to all creditors included in the composition, and the creditors are requested to confirm to the Reconstruction Committee whether or not the proposed composition is accepted. The creditors must accept or reject the composition within a time limit of minimum two, and maximum three weeks. 267 ----- The voluntary composition is considered approved when it has been accepted by all the creditors included in the composition. A compulsory composition is considered approved when it has been accepted by [1]⁄2 of the voting creditors. If the proposed composition is rejected by any of the creditors, the proposal may be subject to negotiations and amended. The new proposal may be distributed to the creditors, always provided that the Reconstruction Committee considers that the amended debt composition is likely to be obtained. If the amended proposal is rejected, no further proposals may be distributed. The only claims which may be excluded from the debt composition are preferential claims, secured claims, valid counterclaims, and claims below a defined threshold set out in the proposed composition.",,as_expected,2020,384,

A provision granting the secured party such right of enforcement is typically included in any security agreement between the pledgor/chargor and the secured party.

In the event of insolvency of a Finnish company, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Finland. Such proceedings would be governed by Finnish law. In case insolvency proceedings are connected to another EU member state within the meaning of regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council on Insolvency Proceedings, and provided that said regulation is applied to such EU member state, the regulation shall apply. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the Finnish insolvency law. The provisions of the Finnish Bankruptcy Act (FI: Konkurssilaki, 120/2004, as amended, “Bankruptcy Act”), the Finnish Restructuring of Enterprises Act (FI: Laki yrityksen saneerauksesta, 47/1993, as amended, “Restructuring Act”) and the Finnish Act on the Recovery of Assets to the Bankruptcy Estate (FI: Laki takaisinsaannista konkurssipesään 758/1991, as amended, “Recovery Act”) are particularly relevant to this discussion. Under Finnish law, if there is an imminent risk of a company becoming insolvent or the company is already insolvent but it is probable that a company restructuring would remedy the company’s insolvency, the company may be placed in a company restructuring (FI: yrityssaneeraus). Alternatively, if a company is insolvent, the company may be subjected to bankruptcy proceedings (FI: konkurssi). In addition to company restructuring and bankruptcy, a Finnish limited liability company may also be subject to liquidation (FI: selvitystila) under the Finnish Companies Act (FI: Osakeyhtiölaki, 624/2006, as amended). However, liquidation proceedings are voluntary and are used in practice to dissolve the company following a bankruptcy or to dissolve a solvent company. In cases where a solvent company is subject to liquidation, there is an obligation to conclude liquidation proceedings and file for bankruptcy if the company’s known debts cannot be fully settled in liquidation. Thus, considerations regarding liquidation proceedings are not addressed in the following.",,as_expected,2020,384,

The commencement of the proceedings as a main rule results in several interdictions regarding restructuring debt (meaning, debt that has arisen before the filing of the application), including a prohibition of repayment and debt collection measures including enforcement of security provided by the debtor company on restructuring debt, and precautionary measures (although debts arising after the filing of the restructuring application must be repaid and can be enforced—please see below), such as the seizure of assets and prohibition of placing of security. The court may order, on the request of the applicant or the debtor, that such interdictions are in effect on an interim basis as of a date prior to the commencement of restructuring proceedings (in other words, shortly after the filing of the application for the restructuring proceedings). The interdictions are in force until the restructuring program has been affirmed by the district court or the proceedings have been, for reasons specified in the Restructuring Act, dismissed or interrupted. Debts arising on the date when the restructuring application has been filed and thereafter are not, as a general rule, considered restructuring debt and must be repaid as they become due.

Subject to certain restrictions set forth in the Restructuring Act, the following measures may be taken with respect to unsecured debts in the restructuring program: (i) changing the repayment schedule; (ii) ordering that debt payments be considered as payments against principal first, and as payments of interest and other credit costs only after the repayment of the principal; (iii) reducing the obligation to pay interest and other credit costs with respect to the remaining term of a debt; and (iv) reducing the outstanding principal balance of unpaid debt. The restructuring program may also include the full or partial refinancing of debt, either as a lump sum funded by the issuance of new debt or with payments in lieu of performance that are considered reasonable having regard to the creditor’s position and field of business. Secured debt means restructuring debt where a creditor holds an effective (against third parties) security interest over assets that belong to or are in the possession of the debtor, in so far as the value of the security at the commencement of the proceedings would have been sufficient to cover the amount of the creditor’s claim after 269 ----- the deduction of liquidation costs and claims with a higher priority. When the interdiction of debt collection is in force, assets pledged by the debtor company as security cannot be liquidated by the pledge holder during restructuring proceedings; instead, secured creditors’ receivables receive preferential treatment based on the value of the security; most importantly their principal cannot be reduced (“cut”) in the restructuring program. The part of the creditor’s claim that is not covered by the value of the security does not qualify as secured debt but, instead, is regarded as unsecured debt for the purposes of the restructuring proceedings and may, thus be subject to the measures described above. Regarding business mortgages, only 50% of the value of the mortgaged assets will be considered as secured debt. The value of the assets will be determined in the restructuring program. The following debt arrangements may be applied to secured debt: (i) changing the repayment schedule; (ii) ordering that debt payments be applied as payments against principal first and as payments of interest and other credit costs second; or (iii) reducing the obligation to pay interest and other credit costs with respect to the remaining term of the debt. The restructuring program may also include the full or partial refinancing of secured debt as a lump sum payment funded by the issuance of new debt. Even if the debt arrangement does not affect the existence or content of a creditor’s security interest, the security arrangements relating to the debt may be altered by replacing the security with another fully adequate security. Payments on a secured debt shall be set so that at least the present value of the secured debt will be repaid within a reasonable period, which shall not materially exceed the remainder of the credit period without the consent of the creditor or, if the debt has become due in full, materially exceed half of the original credit period. As for reducing interest and other credit costs, the length of the remaining credit period should be taken into consideration in the restructuring program, so that the longer the remaining credit period, the smaller the reduction in interest and credit costs.",,as_expected,2020,384,

A creditor may make statements on the draft disbursement list in so far as it concern’s the creditor’s claim. A creditor may also dispute the claim of another creditor or its precedence of rank, as entered into the draft disbursement list.

However, according to the Finnish Act on the Order of Payment of Creditors (1578/1992, as amended, FI: Laki velkojien maksusaantijärjestyksestä), the following creditors have priority over unsecured creditors to receive their claims in the following order: (i) creditors of secured claims (excluding claims secured by business mortgage) and holders of retention rights, with priority over the proceeds from the respective security asset; (ii) creditors of the administrative expenses of the bankruptcy estate, claims on the basis of contracts that the bankruptcy estate (rather than the debtor) has entered into, any liabilities for which the bankruptcy estate is responsible by law and a debt that has arisen between the commencement and discontinuation of restructuring proceedings; (iii) if the company has undergone restructuring proceedings before the bankruptcy, (A) fees and expenses of the restructuring administrator with interest on delayed payments incurred until the time of payment of the fees and expenses and after the satisfaction of said payment and (B) creditors of a debt that has arisen between the commencement and discontinuation of restructuring proceedings, and (iv) creditors with claims that are secured by a business mortgage will receive prior to unsecured claims 50% of the value of the mortgaged assets. In case of secured bankruptcy debts and bankruptcy debts secured by business mortgage, any debt exceeding the value of the assets pledged as security (50% of the value in the case of business mortgage) is considered unsecured debt, unless these fall under another basis of precedence (or subordination—please see below). Under Finnish law, certain claims are settled after all other claims. In practice, the most significant of such claims are the interest accruing on bankruptcy debt during the period after the commencement of the bankruptcy, a bond that pursuant to its terms ranks after all the other obligations of the issuer and a subordinated loan that in insolvency and liquidation may be settled after all the other creditors. The Finnish state has no preferential rights regarding taxes and other fiscal charges. The assets of the bankruptcy estate are to be liquidated (sold or otherwise disposed of) in the most advantageous manner so as to maximize the aggregate net proceeds, for example by way of auctions, through advertising and direct solicitation of potential buyers. However, creditors that are secured pursuant to a fixed charge over movable or immovable property for their bankruptcy receivables may exercise a separate right of liquidation of the assets pledged as security regardless of the bankruptcy proceedings.

According to the Restructuring Act and the Enforcement Code, the grounds for recovery set forth in the Recovery Act shall also be applied in company restructuring and enforcement proceedings. The bankruptcy estate administrator, the restructuring administrator and certain creditors may seek the recovery of assets of the debtor to the bankruptcy estate or the company under restructuring or enforcement proceedings, in connection with bankruptcy, company restructuring or enforcement proceedings. The administrator or the creditors may, within a specified recovery time, either file an action for recovery against the debtor’s counterparty involved in the act in a separate court proceeding or file an objection against or make a statement against a claim filed in bankruptcy. In bankruptcy, this period to file an action is one year from the commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings or three months from the moment that the bankruptcy estate took note or should have taken note of the grounds for recovery. In restructuring, the restructuring administrator must file an action within six months from the commencement of the restructuring proceedings or within three months from the moment that the administrator took note or should have taken note of the grounds for recovery. Certain general rules for recovery apply to all transactions between an insolvent debtor (including a debtor who becomes insolvent partially due to the transaction) and the counterparty of the debtor. A transaction concluded within five years prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, company restructuring or enforcement was filed with the court or another relevant authority (as well as transactions performed after such a date) may be recovered if: (i) the transaction, either by itself or together with other transactions, improperly (a) favors a creditor at the expense of other creditors, (b) places assets of the debtor beyond the reach of creditors, or (c) increases debts to the detriment of creditors; (ii) the debtor, at the time of the transaction, was, or partly due to the transaction became, insolvent, or over-indebted in case of a transaction that can be considered a gift or a contract with the characteristics of a gift; (iii) the counterparty knew or should have known of the insolvency or over-indebtedness, or the relevance of the transaction to the debtor’s economic situation; and (iv) the counterparty knew or should have known of the facts mentioned above in clause (i), on the basis of which the transaction is considered improper. The grounds for recovery under Section 5 of the Recovery Act, which covers all transactions concluded between the debtor and a counterparty, are thus applicable only if the counterparty had qualified or should have had qualified knowledge of all the issues described above in (i) and (ii). Transactions between the debtor and certain (natural or legal) persons within the debtor’s sphere of interest (close parties, FI: läheiset, as defined in the Recovery Act) may be recovered regardless of the date of the transaction and such persons are assumed to have had knowledge of the issues described above in (i) and (ii). Also, the burden of proof with regard to some matters related to the recovery, is reversed if the transaction was concluded between such close parties. Pursuant to the Recovery Act, certain transactions can, in certain circumstances, be recovered regardless of the good faith of the counterparty and regardless of the solvency of the debtor at the time of the transaction. Such transactions include, among other things: (i) payments received through enforcement; (ii) the payment of debts; and (iii) the granting of security or other collateral (and (iv) gifts or contracts with characteristics of a gift, which shall not be discussed further herein). Any debt paid later than three months prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, company restructuring or enforcement was filed with the court or relevant authority (or, in the event that the beneficiary is a person within the debtor’s sphere of interest, as described above, within two years) may be recovered if: (i) unusual means of payment have been used; (ii) the payment was premature; or (iii) the amount of payment was considerable in comparison to the assets of the debtor. However, a payment may not be recovered if it, when all circumstances are taken into consideration, may be considered ordinary. A debt paid to a natural or legal person within the debtor’s sphere of interest may be recovered in respect of the longer two-year period unless it is shown that the debtor, at the time of the payment, was not insolvent or did not become insolvent due to the payment. A security or other collateral given later than three months prior to the date when 272 ----- the petition for bankruptcy, company restructuring or enforcement was filed with the court or the relevant authority (or, in the event that the beneficiary is a person within the debtor’s sphere of interest, within two years) may be recovered if: (i) the parties had not agreed upon the security in connection with the creation of the debt; or (ii) the possession of the security had not been transferred or another act perfecting the security had not been completed without unjustified delay after the creation of the debt. A security given to a natural or legal person within the debtor’s sphere of interest may be recovered in respect of the longer two-year period unless it is shown that the debtor was not insolvent or did not become insolvent due to the arrangements for security. When a transaction is recovered, the assets that have been received from the debtor are returned to the debtor or the bankruptcy estate if the debtor is in bankruptcy. The bankruptcy estate or the debtor also returns the compensation that had been paid for the assets. If the compensation has been placed beyond the reach of the creditors and the party that paid the compensation knew or should have known that this was the intention of the debtor, there is no obligation to return the compensation. If the assets to be returned no longer exist, or are otherwise not returnable, compensation for the value of the assets must be made. In addition, should the return of certain assets cause inconvenience to the party under such obligation, a court may entitle such party to pay compensation equal to the value of the assets instead of returning the assets. The Recovery Act also sets forth an obligation to compensate for any decrease in value of the returnable assets.",,as_expected,2020,384,

Further, a Finnish limited liability company can only distribute its assets in the ways specified in the Finnish Companies Act. Other transactions that reduce the assets of a company or increase its liabilities without a corporate benefit i.e., unless doing so is in the company’s own commercial interest, constitute an unlawful distribution of assets. Granting of guarantees and security requires that the granting of guarantee/security is based on sound business reasons (corporate benefit). The business justification for granting the guarantee or security is assessed on a company-level and on a stand-alone basis. Group benefit can only be taken into regard in case the issuer of the guarantee or security can be reasonably argued to derive as a member of the group a benefit itself as a result of the overall group benefit. In addition to the corporate benefit requirement, the granting of the guarantee/security has to be within the limits of the company’s business purpose (as set out in its articles of association) and the company may not be insolvent and the granting of security may not result in the company becoming insolvent. For the abovementioned reasons, it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to include, where such security is granted for third party liabilities (including other members of the group), language pursuant to which the scope of guarantees and security granted by limited liability companies incorporated in Finland is contractually limited so as to not be in conflict with the relevant statutory limitations. The actual scope of a guarantee issued or security granted by a Finnish obligor may therefore be substantially less than the aggregate amount of liabilities expressed to be guaranteed or secured and, in fact, it is possible that owing to the application of mandatory Finnish law relating to unlawful profit distribution, as applied to the guarantee or security granted, no liabilities or obligations will under Finnish law, be held to be effectively guaranteed or secured.",,as_expected,2020,384,

In order for the perfection to be effective, the pledgor must be effectively deprived of its right to control, deal with or dispose of the security assets. If the pledgor remains in possession of, retains exclusive or shared control over, or remains entitled to operate or collect, invest and dispose of any income from such assets, the relevant security interest will not be deemed to have been effectively created until it is duly perfected, typically after the occurrence of the agreed trigger event. Perfection cannot be achieved once insolvency proceedings have been commenced and can be deemed susceptible and be set aside in insolvency proceedings if perfected within a certain critical time before the commencement of insolvency proceedings. 273 -----",,as_expected,2020,384,

A pledge of shares is typically enforced by private sale and a pledge of receivables either by selling the receivable or by the secured creditor collecting payment of the receivable. Typically, the collection of receivables directly from the debtors of the pledgor results in a more expedient and profitable outcome than a sale of the receivables, both of which are forms of self-enforcement. In case the debtor does not pay the debts in the due time, the pledgee has the possibility to file a claim to the District Court in order to obtain a summary judgment, which can be used as grounds for official enforcement. The Finnish Commercial Code (3/1734, as amended, Kauppakaari) stipulates a default process in respect of an enforcement of pledge of movable assets. The parties may, as a rule, contract out most parts of the default process. The parties’ discretion with regard to the enforcement methods is, however, limited (a) by the statutory invalidity of a contractual provision providing that title to the pledged asset shall, upon default, automatically transfer to the pledgee (however, the debtor and creditor may, after the pledgee has become entitled to enforce the security, effectively agree that an obligation is discharged partly or in full by the pledgee assuming ownership of the pledged asset), and (b) by the pledgee always having a duty to ascertain that the interests of the pledgor and other creditors of the pledgor are not unduly jeopardized due to the actions taken by the pledgee. 274 -----",,as_expected,2020,384,

An application for refusal of enforcement may be lodged with the competent Swedish district court. Where such application is lodged the Swedish court may stay the proceedings if an ordinary appeal against the judgment has been lodged in the Member State of origin or the time for such appeal has not yet expired. Under the 2007 Lugano Convention on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (hereinafter the “Lugano Convention”), a judgment issued against a company in the courts of a member state of the European Union or the European Free Trade Association (hereinafter a “Contracting State”) which is enforceable in that Contracting State, will be enforceable in Sweden upon the fulfilment of the following requirements: (a) that a motion for enforcement has been granted by the competent Swedish district court, and (b) that the formal requirements in the Lugano Convention have been fulfilled. Judgments issued against a Swedish party in the courts of a state which is not a Member State or a Contracting State (hereinafter a “Third Country”) are, as a general rule, not legally recognized or enforceable in Sweden. Instead, a Third Country judgment will be regarded by a Swedish court, administrative tribunal or executive or other public authority merely as factual evidence of, for example, the outcome or circumstances of the dispute to which the judgment relates. The United States is a Third Country. Thus, New York law, which is the governing law of the Additional Notes and the Indenture, falls into the foregoing category. Thus, separate legal proceedings on the same subject matter must generally be commenced in Sweden. During those proceedings the Swedish court will, as a general rule, not be bound by the outcome of the Third Country judgment and may choose to try the dispute without regard to the Third Country judgment. Under certain conditions, including where a contract under review contains an exclusive jurisdiction clause in favor of the Third Country courts, the Swedish court will not re-examine the merits of the claim. Instead, the Swedish court in that case may render a judgment based on the foreign judgment. However, it is nevertheless the Swedish, and not the Third Country, judgment that will ultimately be enforced. Following the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union and the end of the United Kingdom’s transition period, the United Kingdom is deemed a Third Country for the purposes of the Recast Brussels Regulation and the Lugano Convention. However, judgments obtained from a court in the United Kingdom in respect of an exclusive jurisdiction clause under a contract dated on, or after, January 1, 2021, may thereafter be enforced in accordance with, and subject to the fulfilment of the relevant conditions of, the 2005 Hague Convention on choice of court agreements, to which the European Union is a contracting state and the United Kingdom acceded effective from January 1, 2021. Consequently, judgments obtained from a court in the United Kingdom and which either do not fulfil the foregoing requirements or which relate to a contract dated prior to January 1, 2021, may not be enforced in accordance with the Hague Convention. Foreign arbitral awards are enforceable in Sweden pursuant to the Swedish Arbitration Act which reflects the rules of the New York Convention (to which Sweden has acceded).",,as_expected,2020,384,

The financial statements of Assemblin Group (“the Group”) include Assemblin Financing AB (publ) (559077-5952), Assemblin Holding AB (559025-2952) and its subsidiaries. The condensed interim financial statements for the three and nine months ended 30 September 2019 have been prepared as combined financial statements in a way of illustrating financial information for a group of entities that are not a legal group but are ultimately owned and controlled by the same party. These combined financial statements represent the group of entities that became the Group on 6 December 2019 when the parent company of the Group, Assemblin Financing AB, acquired 100% of the shares in a related company, Assemblin Holding AB, from their parent company, Ignition MidCo S.a.r.l, (“Midco”) included in Triton Fund IV since 2015. Assemblin Holding AB was established on 10 July 2015 and is a holding company with operating subsidiaries. Until 6 December 2019 it operated under the direct control from its parent company, MidCo. Assemblin Financing AB was established on 6 December 2016 and is under the direct control from its parent company, MidCo. On 6 December 2019, Assemblin Financing AB acquired all shares in Assemblin Holding AB from Midco for SEK 5,081 million. The consideration paid represents the fair value of the acquired net assets and business at the time of the transaction. For the consideration Assemblin Financing AB issued two promissory notes to Midco, one in the amount of SEK 992 million (“Promissory Note 1”) and one in the amount of SEK 4,089 million (“Promissory Note 2”). Promissory Note 1 was repaid in full on 6 December 2019. The principal amount under Promissory Note 2 was contributed as equity in Assemblin Financing AB by Midco by way of a shareholder contribution. When Assemblin Financing AB legally acquired Assemblin Holding AB the net assets in the consolidated financial statements were not revalued resulting in a reduction to equity. This reduction is presented as a merger reserve consisting of a net of the SEK 5,081 million purchase price and Assemblin Financing AB’s SEK 0 million equity. Also recognized in the merger reserve is the SEK 4,089 million shareholder contribution from Midco through the forgiveness of Promissory Note 2 in connection with the transaction The condensed financial statements for the three and nine months ended 30 September 2020 represent the legal Assembling Financing Group which is the same group of entities as in the combined financial statements for the three and nine months ended 30 September 2019. The combined financial statements do not differ from consolidated financial statements based on historical values and predecessor accounting. Accordingly, the consolidated Group represents a continuation of Assemblin Holdings AB and its subsidiaries’ operations. In order to reflect the economics of the restructuring (without change of control or change in operating activities) and provide the users with relevant information, management elected to present, as the ‘combined’ financial information, the financial information of Assemblin Holdings AB and subsidiaries up until the creation of the accounting group. Therefore, financial statements presented reflect: Š As of 30 September 2020 and 31 December 2019, the consolidated statement of financial position of Assemblin Financing AB. Š For the three and nine months ended on 30 September 2019, the combined statements of profit or loss, comprehensive income, cash flows, changes in equity of Assemblin Holdings AB including its subsidiaries, and the legal entity Assemblin Financing AB. Š For the three and nine months ended on 30 September 2020, the consolidated statements of profit or loss, comprehensive income, cash flows, changes in equity of Assemblin Financing AB.

The ultimate significance of the impact will be primarily determined by the length of time that such reductions and disruptions continue, which will, in turn, depend on the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of measures that might be imposed in response to the pandemic and whether a vaccine or drug can be developed and deployed that allows business operations to return to their pre-pandemic form.

1629,Final Offerings 2020.md,27,LEGAL MATTERS,27.29,Note 4 Financial instruments,27.29.1,,"Shares in Elajo, “Financial investments”, are recognized at assessed fair value via other comprehensive income. The valuation of the shares is performed according to level 3, since the valuation is based on non-observable inputs. Fair value as of 30 September 2020 amounts to SEK 30 million and, at the beginning of the year the fair value amounted to SEK 30 million. The fair value has been calculated on the basis of a profit multiple based on operating profit. The profit multiple is derived based on Assemblin’s experience in acquiring unlisted installation companies. In case the profit multiple and/or operating profit increases, the fair value will also increase. The amount entered as a liability that could be paid to previous owners is SEK 84 million, falling due for payment within one to three years and classified as Level 3 liabilities. The fair value of contingent considerations is measured based on assumptions about expected future payments based in the expected future earnings in the acquired company. Expected future payments are not discounted as it is assessed that there is no time value based on the fact that it is not considered significant. The estimated fair value would decrease (increase) if the expected future earnings in the acquired company were lower (higher). When calculating the fair value of currency swaps the closing quote from the respective counterparties has been used. The liability is SEK 28 million and classified as a Level 2 liability.

The assumptions for inflation and future salary growth have decreased since year-end, reducing the liability, while the discount rate has been lowered, thus increasing the liability. As a result, an actuarial loss of SEK 1 million (nine months period ended 30 September 2019: 100) was recognized in other comprehensive income during the interim period and an actuarial gain of SEK 38 million (nine months period ended 30 September 2019: 100) for the nine months period ended 31 September 2020. Relating to this, a deferred tax of SEK 0 million (nine months period ended 30 September 2019: 21) has been recognized in other comprehensive income during the interim period and SEK 8 million (nine months period ended 30 September 2019: 21) for the nine months period ended 31 September 2020.

The financial statements of Assemblin Group (“the Group”) include Assemblin Financing AB (publ) (559077-5952), Assemblin Holding AB (559025-2952) and its subsidiaries. The financial statements have been prepared as combined financial statements in a way of illustrating financial information for a group of entities that are not a legal group but are ultimately owned by the same party. These combined financial statements represent the group of entities that became the Group on 6 December 2019 when the parent company of the Group, Assemblin Financing AB, acquired 100% of the shares in a related company, Assemblin Holding AB, from their parent company, Ignition MidCo S.a.r.l, (“Midco”) included in Triton Fund IV since 2015. There are no standards applicable under International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) for combined financial statements. The combined financial statements have been prepared using the historical IFRS financial information included in the Group without any remeasurements of the previously recorded IFRS values. The term “combined financial statements” refers to financial information prepared by aggregating financial information for entities under common control that do not meet the definition of a group according to IFRS 10. All intra-group transactions between legal entities within the reporting entity have been eliminated. As a result, the combined financial statements represent the economic activities of the reporting entity that was formed on 6 December 2019. A complete register of the entities that constitute the Group is presented in the combined financial statements, see Note 29. Assemblin Holding AB was established on 10 July 2015 and is a holding company with operating subsidiaries. Until 6 December 2019 it operated under the direct control from its parent company, MidCo. Assemblin Financing AB was established on 6 December 2016 and is under the direct control from its parent company, MidCo. On 6 December 2019, Assemblin Financing AB acquired all shares in Assemblin Holding AB from Midco for SEK 5,081 million. The consideration paid represents the fair value of the acquired net assets and business at the time of the transaction. For the consideration Assemblin Financing AB issued two promissory notes to Midco, one in the amount of SEK 992 million (“Promissory Note 1”) and one in the amount of SEK 4,089 million (“Promissory Note 2”). Promissory Note 1 was repaid in full on 6 December 2019. The principal amount under Promissory Note 2 was contributed as equity in Assemblin Financing AB by Midco by way of a shareholder contribution. When Assemblin Financing AB legally acquired Assemblin Holding AB the net assets in the consolidated financial statements were not revalued resulting in a reduction to equity. This reduction is presented as a merger reserve consisting of a net of the SEK 5,081 million purchase price and Assemblin Financing AB’s SEK 0 million equity. Also recognized in the merger reserve is the SEK 4,089 million shareholder contribution from Midco through the forgiveness of Promissory Note 2 in connection with the transaction. The combined financial statements do not differ from consolidated financial statements from 6 December 2019 based on historical values and predecessor accounting. Accordingly, the consolidated Group represents a continuation of Assemblin Holdings AB and its subsidiaries’ operations. In order to reflect the economics of the restructuring (without change of control or change in operating activities) and provide the users with relevant information, management elected to present, as the ‘combined’ financial information, the financial information of Assemblin Holdings AB and subsidiaries up until the creation of the accounting group. Therefore, the combined financial statements presented reflect: Š As of 31 December 2017 and 2018, the combined statements of financial position of Assemblin Holdings AB including its subsidiaries and the legal entity Assemblin Financing AB. Š As of 31 December 2019, the consolidated statement of financial position of Assemblin Financing AB. F-24 -----",,as_expected,2020,384,

The difference between assets and liabilities is due to the reclassification of pre-paid lease expenses, and moreover, rights of use being recognized based on IFRS 16 having been applied since the start of the agreement as well as the right-of-use assets being reduced by reserves for onerous leases recognized in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets immediately prior to the transition to IFRS 16 on 31 December 2018. When measuring the lease liability, the Group discounted its lease expenses at the incremental borrowing rate at 1 January 2019. The interest rate used in discounting future flows lies between 1.7 and 4.8 per cent, depending on the tenor of the contract.

As of 1 January 2019, the Group determines whether an agreement contains a lease based on the definition of leases in IFRS 16. At the transition to IFRS 16, the Group chose to apply the relief rule of “inheriting” the previous definition of leasing in conjunction with the transition. This means that IFRS 16 is applied to agreements that were previously identified as leases, and that IFRS 16 is not applied to agreements that previously were deemed not to contain leases. Consequently, the definition of leases under IFRS 16 is applied only the agreements that were amended or signed after 1 January 2019. Previously, the Group classified leases as operating or finance leases based on whether the lease transferred the risks and rewards of ownership of the underlying asset. In accordance with IFRS 16, the Group recognizes right-of- use assets and lease liabilities for most leases (i.e. the lease is included in the statement of financial position); exemptions from this are indicated below. _Leases previously classified as operating leases under IAS 17_ At the transition, the lease liabilities were measured at the present value of the remaining lease expenses, discounted by the Group’s incremental borrowing rates on the initial date of application (1 January 2019). Each right-of-use asset was measured at an amount corresponding to the lease liability, adjusted for any prepaid or accrued lease expenses and reserves for onerous contracts. The Group has chosen to apply the following solutions in practice: Š Applied a discount rate based on the Group’s financing expenses on various maturities. Š Adjusted the right-of-use asset by an amount recognized as a provision for operating leases that constituted onerous leases, immediately before the first date of application, as an alternative to performing an impairment review. Š Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities have not been recognized for leases for which the lease term finishes within 12 months or earlier (short- term leases). Š Excluded initial direct payments from the measurement of right-of-use assets on the initial date of application. F-26 -----",,as_expected,2020,384,

This reporting standard replaces IAS 17 Leases. The Group has selected the modified retrospective approach as the transition method, which means that the comparison figures for 2018, 2017 and earlier periods are not restated, and that the difference between right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized in equity adjusted for pre-paid lease expenses and reserves for onerous contracts as at 1 January 2019. The effects of IFRS 16 are recognized at the Group level. The Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the commencement date of a lease. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which consists of the original value of the lease liability plus lease expenses paid on or before the commencement date and any initial direct expenses. The right-of-use asset is thereafter depreciated on a straight-line basis from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the asset and the end of the lease term. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the future lease expenses over the term of the lease that have not been paid on the commencement date. The lease expenses are discounted with the incremental borrowing rate or implicit interest rate of the lease. The term of the lease comprises the non-cancellable period, with the addition of further periods in the contract if, on the commencement date, it is deemed reasonably certain that these will be exercised The lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective rate method. The lease liability is remeasured if the future lease expenses change as the result of such factors as changes to an index or price. When the lease liability is remeasured this way, an equivalent adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset.",,as_expected,2020,384,

A controlling interest exists if the Parent Company has influence over the investment object, is exposed to or has the right to a variable yield from its involvement and can use its influence over the investment to affect the yield. In determining whether controlling influence exists, shares that are potentially entitled to vote — and whether de facto control exists — are taken into account. Subsidiaries are recognized using the acquisition method, which involves the acquisition of a subsidiary being regarded as a transaction through which the Group indirectly acquires the assets of the subsidiary and assumes its liabilities. The acquisition analysis establishes the fair value, on the acquisition date, of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as any holdings with a non-controlling interest. Transaction expenditures that arise, except transaction expenditures attributable to the issue of equity instruments or debt instruments, are recognized directly in profit or loss for the year. In the event of business combinations in which transferred remuneration, any holdings with a non-controlling interest and the fair value of previously owned participations (in conjunction with step acquisitions) exceed the value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed that are recognized separately, the difference is recognized as goodwill. When the difference is negative (bargain purchase), this is recognized directly in profit or loss for the year. Transferred remuneration in connection with the acquisition does not include payments relating to settlement of previous business relationships. These types of settlement are usually recognized in earnings. Contingent considerations are recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. In cases where the contingent consideration is classified as an equity instrument, no restatement is performed, and settlement is made within equity.

The company’s revenue consists primarily of revenue from construction contracts and service assignments. This revenue is recognized over time; it is described below under Construction contracts and Service assignments. Interest income is recognized in revenue over the duration in the contract, with application of the effective rate method. Dividend revenue is recognized when the right to receive payment has been established. The operations are divided into three areas: electricity, ventilation, and heating and sanitation. In all the areas of operation, the revenue streams consist of revenue from construction contracts and service assignments, respectively. _Construction contracts_ In regards to the construction contracts, they are fixed price and revenue from ongoing contracts is recognized over time on the basis of assignment expenditures incurred in relation to the total estimated assignment fees of the assignment. Costs associated with this are recognized in earnings as they arise. In the statement of financial position, contract assignments are recognized gross project by project, either as a contract asset among current assets or as a contract liability among current liabilities. The projects with higher levels of generated revenue than has been invoiced are recognized as assets, whereas the projects that have been invoiced for more than revenue generated are recognized as liabilities. Revenue is based on a contractual fixed price; the remuneration amount is variable only in exceptional cases. Payment is usually received in stages while the construction contracts is being completed; payment is normally received before the stage is begun. In a number of construction contracts, however, payment is received after the stage is completed. Changes in the scope of the assignment, claims and incentive remuneration are included in project revenue to the extent that they are agreed upon with the customer and can be reliably measured. A fundamental condition for reporting revenue over time is that the course of events can reasonably be measured against completion of the performance obligation. For projects in which the outcome of a performance obligation cannot reasonably be measured, but coverage is expected for the expenditures that arise from completing the performance obligation, only revenue for expenditures incurred up until the result of the performance obligation can reasonably be measured is reported.

Revenue is recognized according to the percentage of completion method. _Construction contracts_ The group applies the percentage of completion method. Under the percentage of completion method, profit or loss is recognized in proportion to the stage of completion. To determine the profit or loss incurred at a given point in time, information about the following components is needed: Š Project revenue – the aggregated value of revenue attributable to the construction contract. Š Project cost all costs relating to project revenue which are attributable to the individual project. Š Stage of completion – recognized costs in relation to estimated total costs of the project. A basic condition for the percentage of completion method is that project revenue and project cost can be measured reliably, and that the stage of completion must be determined in a way that is relevant with respect to the requirement of reliability. A zero-profit margin is used for projects where revenue and costs cannot be measured reliably. This means that the project is recognized with an income that corresponds to the incurred cost, i.e. profit is recognized to SEK 0 pending an assessment of profit. As soon as possible, revenue is recognized according to the percentage of completion method. As an asset, the Group recognizes receivables (balance sheet item: Revenue generated but uninvoiced) from customers for construction contracts where project costs and recognized profits (after deductions for recognized losses) exceed the invoiced amounts. Partly invoiced amounts that have not yet been paid by the customer and amounts withheld by the customer are included in the item Accounts receivable.

The process of change is described under Amended accounting policies attributable to new or amended IFRS. As of 1 January 2020, the Group leases primarily premises and vehicles. Leases are recognized as rights of use and a corresponding liability as of the date the leased asset is available for use by the Group. Lease liabilities are initially recognized at the present value of remaining lease expenses over the term of the lease. Lease expenses include fixed expenses and variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate. The lease term consists of the non-cancellable period of the agreement. Lease payments have been discounted by the incremental borrowing rate as regards leased premises, and by the implicit interest rate as regards vehicles. When an agreement is signed, the Group judges whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Similarly, the value of the liability and the asset are adjusted in conjunction with a reassessment of the lease term. This occurs in conjunction with the passing of the final cancellation date in a previously assessed lease term, or alternately when significant events take place or when circumstances have changed significantly within the control of the Group and impact the existing assessment of the lease term. The Group is exposed to any future increases of variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate that are not included in the lease liability before they enter force. When adjustments of lease payments that depend on an index or a rate enter force, the lease liability is restated against the right-of-use asset. Lease payments are divided between amortization of the liability an interest. The interest is recognized in profit or loss over the term of the lease. Rights of use are normally depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life and the lease term. Payments for agreements of less than one year and low-value leases are expensed on a straight-line basis in the balance sheet. _Policy applicable before 1 January 2019_ Leases are classified either as finance leases or operating leases. Finance leases exist where the financial risks and benefits associated with ownership are essentially transferred to the lessee. If this is not the case, it is an operating lease. Assets leased under finance leases are recognized as non-current assets in the statement of financial position, and are initially measured at the lower of the lease object’s fair value and the present value of the minimal lease expenditures when the contract was signed. The obligation to pay future lease expenses is recognized as longterm and current liabilities. The leased assets are depreciated over the useful lives of the respective assets, whereas lease payments are recognized as interest and repayment of the liabilities. As a rule, assets leased under operating leases are not recognized as assets in the statement of financial position, nor do operating leases give rise to a liability.",,as_expected,2020,384,

Even in cases where new components are created, the expenditure is added to the cost.

Partially invoiced amounts that have not yet been settled by the customer, and amounts held by the client are included in Trade receivables. The Group reports as liabilities (balance-sheet item Contract liabilities) all liabilities to clients in ongoing construction contracts for which invoiced amounts exceed project costs and recognized profits (less recognized losses). _Service assignments_ In regards to service assignments, revenue and the appurtenant costs are recognized over time (i.e. in pace with the service being provided to the customer). Measurement of the course of events is established on the basis of assignment expenditures incurred in relation to the total estimated assignment expenditures. A number of service assignments are charged by the hour on open account; in such cases, the customer normally receives the services provided on an hour-by-hour basis. In other service assignments, payment is normally received after the assignment is completed. The Group identifies certain derivatives as hedge instruments to ensure variability in the cash flow associated with highly likely transactions arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. _New accounting principles for 2020 and going forward_ The group applies, from 1 January 2020, the simplified standards that IASB has published concerning hedge accounting, where the underlying basis interest rates can be affected by the IBOR reform. In accordance with the additions to IFRS 9, the presumption is that the EURIBOR based payments made on the currency interest swap as well as on the senior secured notes are unchanged during the duration of the hedge and the group therefore can continue to apply hedge accounting (IFRS 9.6.8.4 – 6.8.6) . _Cash flow hedges_ When a derivative is identified as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of the changes in fair value in the derivative is recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulates in the hedge reserve. The effective portion of the changes in fair value in the derivative recognized in other comprehensive income is limited to the cumulative change in fair value in the hedged item, determined on a percentage basis, from the start of the hedge. Ineffective portions of changes in fair value in the derivative are recognized immediately in earnings. For the hedged forecast transactions, the accumulated amount in the hedge reserve is reclassified to earnings in the same period(s) that the hedged anticipated cash flow impacts earnings. If the hedged cash flow is no longer expected to arise, the amount that has accumulated in the hedge reserve is immediately reclassified to earnings. _Classification of financial instruments prior to 1 January 2018_ Prior to the introduction of IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018, the Group’s holdings of financial assets such as Loans and receivables or Financial assets/liabilities were measured at fair value through profit or loss and Available-for-sale financial assets under IAS 39. All financial liabilities were classified as other liabilities and measured at amortized cost. For more information, refer to Note 19. _De-recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities_ A financial asset is derecognized from the statement of financial position when the contractual rights to the cash flow from the financial asset expire, or if Assemblin transfers the right to receive the contractual cash flows through a transaction in which essentially all risks and benefits are transferred to the counterparty. The Group derecognizes a financial liability from the statement of financial position when the commitments indicated in the agreement have been extinguished, annulled, or expire. The Group also derecognizes a financial liability when the terms of the contract are modified and the cash flows from the modified liability are materially different. In this case, a new financial liability is recognized at fair value based on the modified conditions. _Off-setting_ A financial asset and a financial liability are offset and recognized with a net amount in the statement of financial position only when there exists a legal right to offset the amount, and there is an intent to settle the items with a net amount or to simultaneously realize the asset and settle the liability. _Estimated useful life:_ Š machinery and other technical assets, 5–12 years Š furniture, tools and fittings 5–10 years The depreciation methods used, residual values and useful lives are reviewed at the end of every year. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less the cost to sell and value-in-use. In calculating value-in-use, future cash flows are discounted by a discount factor that takes into account the risk-free interest rate and the risk associated with the specific asset. _Reversal of impairment losses_ An impairment of assets included in the field of application for IAS 36 is reversed if there is both an indication that impairment no longer exists, and a change has occurred in the assumptions that formed the basis for calculating the recoverable amount. Goodwill impairment, however, is never reversed. A reversal only occurs to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset after reversal does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been recognized, less amortization where appropriate, if no impairment had occurred. _Impairment of financial assets_ Reserves for expected credit losses are calculated and reported for the financial assets measured at amortized cost, and for the financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. Reserves for credit losses are initially calculated and reported based on twelve months of expected credit losses. If the credit risk has significantly increased since the financial asset was first recognized, reserves for credit losses are calculated and reported based on expected credit losses for the entire remaining life of the asset. For trade receivables that do not contain a significant finance component, a simplified method is applied and reserves for credit losses are calculated and reported based on expected credit losses for the entire remaining life, regardless of whether or not the credit risk has substantially increased. Calculation of expected credit losses is primarily based on information about historical losses for similar receivables and counterparties. The historical information is continually evaluated and adjusted based on the current situation, and the Group’s expectations regarding future events. _Impairment of financial instruments prior to 1 January 2018_ For 2017, the Group assessed at the end of every reporting period whether there was objective evidence that impairment existed for a financial asset or group of financial assets. A financial asset or a group of financial assets was impaired only if there was objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset and that this event was deemed to have an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset that could be reliably estimated. The net of the estimated present value of the obligations and the fair value of the plan assets is recognized in the statement of financial position as either a provision or a long-term financial receivable. The pension cost and pension obligation for defined-benefit pension plans are calculated annually by independent actuaries. The discount rate is the interest rate, on the balance-sheet date, of mortgage bonds, with a tenor that corresponds to the Group’s pension obligations. When there is no functioning market for such corporate bonds, the market rate on government bonds with an equivalent tenor is used instead. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. Moreover, the fair value of any plan assets is estimated as of the reporting date. Net interest expenses/income on the defined-benefit obligation/asset are recognized in profit or loss for the year under Net financial items. Net interest items are based on the interest rate that arises when discounting the net obligation, i.e. interest rate on the obligation, plan assets, and interest rate on the effect of any asset ceilings. Other components are recognized in operating profit. Translation effects consist of actuarial gains and losses, the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the sum included in net interest items, and any changes in the effects of asset ceilings (excluding interest included in net interest items). The translation effects are recognized in Other comprehensive income. When the calculation results in an asset for the Group, the net carrying amount for the asset is restricted to the lower of the surplus in the plan and the asset ceiling calculated using the discount rate. The asset ceiling consists of the present value of the future financial benefits in the form of reduced future fees or cash repayment. Any requirements for minimum funding are taken into account in calculating the present value of future repayments or receipts. Changes to or reductions in a defined-benefit plan are recognized at the earliest of the following: a) when the change or reduction in the plan occurs; or b) when the company recognizes related restructuring costs and termination benefits. The changes and reductions are recognized directly in profit or loss for the year. The special employer’s contributions constitute a part of the actuarial assumptions and are therefore recognized as part of the net obligation or asset. For reasons of simplification, the part of the special employer’s contribution in a legal entity that is calculated based on the Pension Obligations Vesting Act is recognized as an accrued cost instead of as a part of the net obligation or asset. Tax on returns is recognized on an ongoing basis in profit or loss for the year for the period the tax relates to, and is therefore not included in the liability calculation. With funded plans, the tax is charged to the return on plan assets and is recognized in Other comprehensive income. With unfunded or partially funded plans, the tax is charged to profit or loss for the year. _Termination benefits_ A cost for benefits in connection with termination of personnel is recognized when the company can no longer withdraw the offer to the employee or when the company recognizes costs for restructuring, whichever is earlier. The benefits that are expected to be settled after twelve months are recognized at their present value. Benefits that are not expected to be fully settled within twelve months are recognized under long-term benefits. 2019 Some of the leased properties have been sub-let by the Group. The income from sub-leases amounts to SEK 4 million (2018 and 2017: 4). The payments for the coming years are expected to MSEK (2018: 9).

In late 2018, Assemblin El AB acquired the shares in Norrlands Industrimontage AB (NIAB), with 1 January 2019 as the date of acquisition. This acquisition strengthens its market presence in northern Sweden and strengthens its service operations. F-54 ----- On 1 March 2019, Assemblin VS AB acquired Värmesvets Entreprenad i Eslöv AB through a share transfer. The company operates across the country, but with its primary focus in the Malmö region and in Jönköping and environs, where it offers services in heating and sanitation, licensed piping and process installations for industry, and district heating distribution. The company’s competence, primarily in district heating, and presence in the industrial sector gives Assemblin even more breadth in an already extensive customer offering. On 1 June 2019, Assemblin VS AB acquired all shares in Industri och Värmemontage Werme AB to increase its market presence in the Uppsala region. The company specializes in conversion and new construction as well as maintenance of district heating substations, gas and steam substations and conduit work for customers primarily in energy and industrial companies. The acquisition is a part of Assemblin’s continuing strategy to increase its presence in the industrial sector and to strengthen its competence in district heating. On 1 June 2019, Assemblin VS AB acquired all shares in KP Svets & Smide AB, a former subsidiary of Industri och Värmemontage Werme AB. The company specializes in cast ironwork and repairs, and collaborates to a great extent with Industri och Värmemontage Werme AB on constructing steel and iron- work solutions for their projects. The acquisition of the company ensures a secure partner for Assemblin as regards deliveries of welding and ironwork solutions, which will lead to shorter turnaround times with an increase in production quality and thus a better customer delivery throughout. In October 2019, Assemblin AS acquired Bygg og Varme through an assets and liabilities transaction that will mean an expanded service offering in the Oslo area. In October 2019, Assemblin Oy acquired the cooling operations of Suomen Kylmäpiste Oy through an assets an liabilities transaction. With cooling operations primarily in the Uusimaa region of Finland, the company strengthens Assemblin Oy’s offering in cooling and property services. Hagen Holding AS (now rechristened Assemblin Innlandet AS) and its three subsidiaries were acquired in October, with 1 November 2019 as the date of possession. The company supplements existing heating and sanitation operations in Norway, and strengthens market presence north of Oslo. Effects of business combinations (MSEK)** 2019 2018 2017 The most important assumptions in the analysis are future growth rate in revenue, adjusted EBITDA margin and discount rate. These assumptions are based on the budget and on forecasts built on previous experiences as well as internal and external sources of information. The assumptions used to extrapolate beyond the latest forecast period are established through the company’s ability to retain its margins and grow in line with long-term market growth/inflation, based on forecasts from central banks and similar institutions. Discount rates are established using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM, starting from external assessments of risk-free rate, volatility, yield requirements on equity and our finance costs for external credit facilities). Annual growth for the period after 2024 is assumed to be 2.0 per cent (2018 and 2017: 2.0). The present value of the forecast cash flows has been calculated with a discount rate of 8.0 per cent (2018 and 2017: 9.0) before tax, based on a weighted average of the company’s cost for externally borrowed capital and yield requirement on equity considering the specific risk in the business. It is the company’s opinion that growth after 2024 and the discount rate will be the same for all cash-generating units, while the cash generating units are facing the same risk profile. As of 31 December 2019, the value-in-use exceeds the carrying amount for all units tested. Thus, there is no impairment, and no reasonable possible changes in the material assumptions would give rise to impairment. Electricity Heating & sanitation Ventilation Norway Finland Group-wide Total _Sensitivity analysis — interest rate risk_ The impact of an interest rate hike of 1 percentage point at the balance sheet date on interest revenue and interest expenses during the coming twelve-month period would total SEK 17.6 million (12.7), given the interest-bearing assets and liabilities existing on the balance-sheet date. Under IFRS 9, the Group must recognize credit losses earlier than under the rules in IAS 39. Assemblin and its subsidiaries have historically had low levels of verified customer losses, and it is believed this will remain unchanged in 2019 and beyond. In assessing expected credit losses, the receivables are divided into risk according to the number of days past due. The Group’s major customers are subjected to credit checks through credit rating agencies, and the subsidiaries carefully monitor cancelled and delayed payments. The Group invoices customers on a rolling basis during the production period, which means that any credit losses are detected at an early stage. Advance invoicing is also applied in cases where it is considered necessary or called for. Trade receivables assume a large number of customers and projects in various industries and geographical areas. Contract assets total SEK 441 million (2018: 408) and relate to revenue that has been incurred but not invoiced. In light of the Group’s historically low levels of credit losses, the impact from the impairment model under IFRS 9 is deemed to be insignificant.

Income tax is recognized in profit or loss for the year, except when underlying transactions were recognized in other comprehensive income or in equity, whereupon the appurtenant tax effect is recognized in other comprehensive income or in equity. Current tax is tax that is to be paid or received in regards to the current year, with application of the tax rates determined in fact or in practice on the balance sheet date. Adjustment of current tax attributable to earlier periods also belongs to current tax. Deferred tax is calculated using the balance-sheet method, starting from temporary differences between the recognized and taxable values of assets and liabilities. Temporary differences are not taken into account in Group goodwill, or for differences that arose during the initial recognition of assets and liabilities that are not business combinations, and that at the transaction date do not impact either recognized or taxable earnings. Moreover, temporary differences attributable to participation in subsidiaries and joint ventures that are not expected to be cancelled within the foreseeable future are not taken into account. Measurement of deferred tax is based on how the underlying assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. Deferred tax is calculated using application of the tax rates and tax regulations determined in fact or in practice on the balance-sheet date. Deferred tax assets regarding deductible temporary differences and tax loss carry-forwards are only recognized to the extent it is likely they will be utilized. The value of deferred tax assets is reduced when it is no longer deemed likely that they can be utilized. Any future income tax that arises in connection with a dividend is reported on the same date as when the dividend is recognized as a liability.",,as_expected,2020,384,

Trade receivables (without a significant finance component) are initially measured at the transaction price established under IFRS 15. _Classification and subsequent measurement of financial assets_ All of the Group’s financial assets, except for holdings of shares and participations and derivatives, are measured at amortized cost. This is because they are held as part of a business model whose goal is to obtain the contractual cash flows, while the cash flows from assets consist only of payments of principal and interest. The Group’s holding of shares and participations is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. _Classification and subsequent measurement of financial liabilities_ All financial liabilities except derivatives are recognized at amortized cost. Any difference between the amount received (net after transaction costs) and the repayment amount recognized in profit or loss, is allocated over the period of the loan using the effective interest-rate method. Financial liabilities are classified as current liabilities if the Group does not have an unconditional right to defer payment of the liability for at least twelve months after the balance-sheet date. Derivatives with a negative fair value for Assemblin are recognized as derivative liabilities and measured at fair value through profit or loss, since hedge accounting is not applied. _Hedge accounting of derivatives, and hedge accounting_ The Group holds derivatives to hedge its foreign currency.

If there is an indicator of impairment, the recoverable amount of the asset is calculated (see below). For goodwill and intangible assets that are not yet ready for use, the recoverable amount is calculated yearly. If materially independent cash flows cannot be determined for an individual asset, and its fair value less the cost to sell cannot be used, the assets are grouped when testing the need for impairment at the lowest level where it is possible to identify materially independent cash flows; this is known as a cash-generating unit. An impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (group of units) exceeds the recoverable amount. An impairment is recognized as a cost in profit or loss for the year. When impairment is identified for a cash-generating unit (group of units), the impairment amount is allocated first of all to goodwill.

A provision is recognized in the statement of financial position when there is an existing legal or informal obligation as a result of an event that has occurred, it is probable that an outflow of financial resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are made with the amount that is the best estimation of what will be required to settle the existing obligation on the balance-sheet date. Where the effect of the timing of the payment is substantial, provisions are calculated through discounting the anticipated future cash flow at an interest rate before tax that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of the money and, if appropriate, the risks associated with the liability. _Warranties_ A provision for warranties is recognized when the underlying products or services are sold. The provision is based on historical warranty data and a comparison of potential outcomes in relation to the likelihoods associated with each outcome. Fulfilment warranties are included in monetary terms until the contract is surrendered to the client, which normally occurs in connection with an approved final inspection. If the warranty covers all or most of the contract sum, the amount of the contingency is calculated as the contract sum less the value of the completed portion. In cases where the warranty covers only a smaller part of the contract sum, the amount of the guarantee contract is carried as an unchanged amount up until the contract is surrendered to the client. In connection with the surrender of the contract, a security in the form of warranties from the bank or insurance institution is pledged for completion. In turn, the issuer of the warranty normally receives a counter obligation from the contracting company or other Group company. Such counter obligations relating to own contracts are not recognized as contingencies, since they contain no increased responsibility compared with the contract commitment. _Restructuring_ A provision for restructuring is recognized when there is an established, detailed and formal restructuring plan and the restructuring has either begun or been publicly announced. No provision is made for future operating costs. _Onerous leases_ A provision for onerous leases is recognized when the anticipated benefits that the Group expects to receive from a contract are lower than the inevitable costs for fulfilling the obligations under the contract.",,as_expected,2020,384,

The operations also cover services in security and industrial servicing. A portion of production takes place in the company’s proprietary electrical power stations. Š Heating & sanitation — designs, installs and maintains technical systems for heating, sanitation, sprinklers, industry, energy and cooling in all types of buildings. Š Ventilation — specialists in construction, installation, service and maintenance of energy-smart ventilation facilities. Š Norway — possesses a high degree of competency in primarily electricity, heating and sanitation, and automation. Š Finland — operations offer services in electricity, ventilation, heating and sanitation, and in automation and energy efficiency as well. These segments are the primary divisions that the company’s chief operating decision maker (CEO) observes in regards to earnings, capital requirements and cash flows. Each operating segment has a director who drives operating activities and reports the outcome from the segment to CEO, which they are also a part of. The earnings, assets and liabilities of the operating segments have included directly attributable items, as well as items that can reasonably and reliably be allocated to the segments.

1629,Final Offerings 2020.md,3088,(MSEK)** **2019,3088.56,"Combined financial statements of Assemblin Group for financial years 2019, 2018 and 2017 Alecta",3088.56.1,,"For salaried employees in Sweden, the defined-benefit pension obligations in the ITP-2 plan for retirement and family pensions are secured through insurance with Alecta. According to a statement from the Swedish Financial Reporting Board, this is a defined-benefit plan that covers several employees. For the financial year, the company did not have access to such information as would make it possible to recognize this plan as a definedbenefit plan. The pension plan under ITP secured through insurance with Alecta is thus recognized as a definedcontribution plan. The premium for the defined-benefit retirement and family pension is calculated individually and is based on such factors as the salary, previously earned pension and expected remaining length of service. Expected contributions in the next reporting period for ITP 2 insurance with Alecta amount to SEK 29.2 million (2018: 27). The Group’s share of the total contributions to the pension scheme is 0.07% (2018: 0.09%), while its share of the total number of active members in the scheme is 0.06% (2018: 0.06%). Annual fees for pension insurance contracted with Alecta totals SEK 55.5 million (2018: 51.5, 2017: 49.6). Alecta’s surplus can be allocated to policy holders and/or the insured. The collective consolidation level consists of the market value of Alecta’s actuarial calculations, which do not correspond with IAS 19. In the event of low consolidation levels, one measure could be raising the contracted price for new policies and expanding existing benefits. In the event of high consolidation levels, one measure could be introducing premium reductions. The collective consolidation level is normally allowed to vary between 125 and 155 percent. If Alecta’s consolidation level falls below 125 percent or rises above 155 percent, measures must be taken to enable the consolidation level to return to the normal range. At year end, Alecta’s surplus in the form of the collective consolidation level totaled 148 per cent (2018: 142, 2017: 154). In the event of low consolidation levels, one measure could be raising the contracted price for new policies and expanding existing benefits. In the event of high consolidation levels, one measure could be introducing premium reductions. The premiums to Alecta are calculated using assumptions interest rates, life expectancy, operating costs and tax on returns from pension funds, so that the payment of a consistent amount of premium up to the date the date of retirement is sufficient to ensure the entire, targeted benefit, based on the insured´s current pensionable salary, is, in fact earned. There is no agreed framework to guide the process of managing any deficit that may arise. In the first instance, losses will be covered by Alecta´s collective consolidation capital and will thus not lead to increased costs through higher contractual premiums. Nor are there guidelines on how surplus of deficits should be allocated in the event of dissolution of the scheme or a company´s withdrawal from the scheme. F-47 -----",,as_expected,2020,384,

Financial assets measured at fair value via other comprehensive income relate primarily to Elajo. Shares in Elajo are recognized at fair value 30 (2018 and 2017: 30). The valuation is executed according to level 3, since the valuation is based on non-observable inputs. The fair value has been calculated on the basis of a profit multiple based on operating profit. The profit multiple is derived based on Assemblin’s experience in acquiring unlisted installation companies. In case the profit multiple and/or operating profit increases, the fair value will also increase. For all other items, excluding bank borrowings, the recorded value is an approximation of the fair value, which is why these items are not divided into levels under the measurement hierarchy. Bank borrowings and Lease liabilities belong to Level 2. Loans to credit institutions and lease liabilities run with variable interest rates, which means that the value of the liabilities is not affected by changes in the base rate. The Group considers that there has also been no change in the credit margins that could materially affect the fair value of the liabilities for that reason the recorded value is also deemed to essentially correspond to the fair values. Shareholder loans run with fixed interest rates that are deemed to correspond to a market-based interest rate on the balance-sheet date, which is why the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
