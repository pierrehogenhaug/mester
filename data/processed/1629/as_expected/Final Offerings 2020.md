-----

Under no circumstances shall the Offering Memorandum constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer
to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale
would be unlawful. If a jurisdiction requires that the offering be made by a licensed broker or dealer and the
Initial Purchasers (as defined herein) or any affiliate of the Initial Purchasers is a licensed broker or dealer in that
jurisdiction, the offering shall be deemed to be made by the Initial Purchasers or such affiliate on behalf of the
Issuer in such jurisdiction.

The Offering Memorandum has not been approved for the purposes of Section 21 of the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) by an authorized person under FSMA. In the United Kingdom, the attached
Offering Memorandum and any other material in relation to the securities described therein are being distributed
only to, and are directed only at, persons who are “qualified investors” (as defined in Article 2 of the UK
Prospectus Regulation) who are (i) persons having professional experience in matters relating to investments
falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005
(the “Financial Promotion Order”), or (ii) high net worth entities falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) of the
Financial Promotion Order, or (iii) persons to whom it would otherwise be lawful to distribute them, all such
persons together being referred to as “Relevant Persons.” The securities are only available to, and any invitation,
offer or agreement to subscribe, purchase or otherwise acquire such securities will be engaged in only with,
Relevant Persons. The Offering Memorandum and its contents are confidential and should not be distributed,
published or reproduced (in whole or in part) or disclosed by any recipients to any other person in the United
Kingdom. Any person in the United Kingdom that is not a Relevant Person should not act or rely on the Offering
Memorandum or its contents. The expression “UK Prospectus Regulation” means Regulation (EU) 2017/1129
(the “Prospectus Regulation”) as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act
2018 (“EUWA”).

No person may communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment
activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the
securities other than in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer (as
defined herein). Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market
assessment in respect of the securities has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the securities is
eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended,
“MiFID II”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the securities to eligible counterparties and professional
clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the securities (a
“distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor
subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the securities
(by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate
distribution channels.

The Temporary Notes and the Additional Notes described in the Offering Memorandum are not intended to be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any
retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a
retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive
(EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined
in the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No
1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the securities described in the Offering
Memorandum or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore
offering or selling the securities described in the Offering Memorandum or otherwise making them available to
any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation. The Offering Memorandum has
been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in any Member State will be made pursuant to an
exemption under Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the Temporary
and the Additional Notes. The Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus
Regulation.

The Temporary and the Additional Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and
should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (“UK”). For
these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point
(8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; (ii) a
customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA
to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined
in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
EUWA. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part
of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Temporary and
the Additional Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and


-----

therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may
be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

**OFFERING MEMORANDUM** **NOT FOR GENERAL DISTRIBUTION**
**STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL** **IN THE UNITED STATES**

## Assemblin Financing AB (publ)

_(incorporated under the laws of Sweden)_
**€100,000,000 Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2025**

Assemblin Financing AB (publ), a registered Swedish public limited liability company (publikt aktiebolag) (the “Issuer”), is offering €100.0 million aggregate
principal amount of its temporary Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2025 (the “Temporary Notes”). The Temporary Notes will be issued by the Issuer
under a temporary indenture (the “Temporary Indenture”), dated as of February 11, 2021 (the “Issue Date”) entered into by, among others, the Issuer and the
Temporary Trustee (as defined herein). On or about the date of the completion of the Fidelix Acquisition (as defined herein) (the “Completion Date”), the
Temporary Notes will be automatically exchanged for an equal aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2025 (the “Additional
Notes”) (such exchange, the “Temporary Notes Exchange”). The Additional Notes will be issued as additional notes under the indenture dated December 6, 2019
entered into by, among others, the Issuer, the Guarantors (as defined herein) and the Trustee (as defined herein) pursuant to which the Issuer issued €250.0 million
aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes (the “Original Notes”). The Temporary Notes will have the same terms as the Original Notes,
except as described herein. The Temporary Notes will trade separately from the Original Notes, will have different ISIN/common code numbers than the Original
Notes and will not be fungible with the Original Notes. The Additional Notes will have the same terms as the Original Notes and will be treated as a single class
together with the Original Notes for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase.
After giving effect to the issuance of the Additional Notes, the aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding under the Indenture will be €350.0 million. The
Temporary Notes, the Additional Notes and the Original Notes are referred to collectively in this offering memorandum as the “Notes” unless indicated otherwise.
The Issuer will pay interest on the Notes at a per annum rate equal to three-month EURIBOR (with a floor of 0%) plus 5%, reset quarterly. Interest on the
Temporary Notes and the Additional Notes will accrue from December 15, 2020, and will be payable quarterly in arrear on each March 15, June 15, September 15
and December 15, commencing on March 15, 2021. The Notes will mature on May 15, 2025. The Issuer is entitled at its option to redeem all or a portion of the
Notes at the applicable redemption prices set forth under the heading “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption” plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but
excluding, the redemption date.
In addition, the Issuer may redeem all, but not part, of the Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (including accrued and unpaid interest
and Additional Amounts, if any) upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law. Upon the occurrence of certain defined events constituting a change
of control, each holder of the Notes may require the Issuer to repurchase all or a portion of its Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any.
Pending the consummation of the Fidelix Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers (as defined herein) will, concurrently with the issuance of the Temporary Notes on
the Issue Date, deposit with the Escrow Agent (as defined herein) an amount equal to the gross proceeds of the Offering sold on the Issue Date into the Escrow
Account (as defined herein). The Escrow Account will be controlled by the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Account, together with the Escrowed Property (as defined
herein), will be pledged on a first-priority basis in favor of the Temporary Trustee or the Security Agent for the benefit of the holders of the Temporary Notes,
pursuant to the Escrow Account Charge (as defined herein). The release of escrow proceeds will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. If the release
does not take place on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date (as defined herein), or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Temporary Notes will be
subject to a Special Mandatory Redemption (as defined herein) at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price of the Temporary Notes, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, from the Issue Date to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined herein). See “Description of the Temporary
_Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”_
The Original Notes are, and the Temporary Notes and the Additional Notes will be, senior secured obligations of the Issuer, and the Original Notes rank, and the
Temporary Notes and Additional Notes will rank, senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s future debt that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the
Notes and will rank pari passu in right of payment with the Issuer’s existing and future debt that is not so subordinated, including the Issuer’s obligations under the
Super Senior Facilities (as defined herein). The Temporary Notes will not be guaranteed. To secure the payment of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price, on the
Issue Date, the obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Temporary Notes will be secured by a first-priority security interest over the Escrow Account pursuant to the
Escrow Charge. The obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Original Notes are, and upon the Temporary Notes Exchange, the obligations of the Issuer pursuant to
the Additional Notes will be, guaranteed, jointly and severally on a senior basis, by each subsidiary of the Issuer that is a guarantor under the Super Senior Facilities.
The Notes Guarantees (as defined herein) will rank senior in right of payment to the respective Guarantor’s future debt that is expressly subordinated in right of
payment to such Notes Guarantee and will rank pari passu in right of payment with the respective Guarantor’s existing and future debt that is not so subordinated,
including such Guarantor’s obligations under the Super Senior Facilities. The Original Notes are, and upon the Temporary Notes Exchange, the Additional Notes
will be, secured by a first-priority security interest in the same assets that secure the Issuer’s and Guarantors’ obligations under the Super Senior Facilities, subject to
certain agreed security principles and agreed exceptions. The Original Notes are, and upon the Temporary Notes Exchange, the Additional Notes will be, secured by
the Completion Date Collateral (as defined herein). Within 60 business days of the Completion Date, the Original Notes and the Additional Notes will be secured by
the Post-Completion Date Collateral (as defined herein). Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of enforcement of the security interests over the
Collateral (as defined herein) and certain distressed disposals, holders of Original Notes and Additional Notes will receive proceeds from the Collateral only after the
Super Senior Facilities, certain hedging obligations and certain other indebtedness permitted to be incurred on a priority basis under the Indenture, if any, have been
repaid in full. The validity, enforceability and, in respect of the security interests over the Collateral, priority and ranking of the Notes Guarantees and the security
interests and the liability of the Guarantors, are subject to the limitations described in “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests.” The Temporary Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of all of our subsidiaries,_
and the Additional Notes will be structurally subordinated to all obligations of the Issuer’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Additional Notes and effectively
subordinated to any existing and future debt of the Issuer and the Guarantors that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Additional Notes, to the
extent of the value of such property and assets.
The Original Notes have been admitted to listing on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”). There is currently no market for the
Temporary Notes or the Additional Notes. Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”) for the listing of
and permission to deal in the Temporary Notes and the Additional Notes on the Official List of the Exchange. There can be no assurance, however, that the
Temporary Notes or the Additional Notes will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the Temporary Notes or the
Additional Notes will be granted or that such listing will be maintained. The Exchange is not a regulated market pursuant to the provisions of Directive
2004/39/EC on markets in financial instruments, as amended, or Article 2(1)(13A) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of
the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.
This offering memorandum may not be reproduced or used for any other purpose, nor be furnished to any other person other than those to whom copies have been sent.
**Investing in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 36.**

Issue price of the Temporary Notes: 100.000% plus accrued interest, if any, from December 15, 2020 to, but excluding, the Issue Date

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or the
laws of any other jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Temporary Notes, the Additional Notes and the Notes Guarantees may not be offered or sold within the United
States, except to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act (“Rule 144A”) and
to certain persons outside the United States in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act (“Regulation S”). You are hereby notified
that sellers of the Temporary Notes, the Additional Notes and the Notes Guarantees may be relying on the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the
Securities Act provided by Rule 144A. See “Notice to Certain Investors” and “Transfer Restrictions” for additional information about eligible offerees and
transfer restrictions.
The Temporary Notes and the Additional Notes will be in registered form in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess
thereof. The Temporary Notes and the Additional Notes will be represented on issue by global notes, which will be delivered in book-entry form through
Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking S.A. (“Clearstream”) on or about the Issue Date (in the case of the Temporary Notes) and on or
about the Completion Date (in the case of the Additional Notes). Interests in each global note will be exchangeable for the relevant definitive notes only in certain
limited circumstances. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.”

The information contained in this offering memorandum has been furnished by the Issuer and other sources
believed by the Issuer to be reliable. This offering memorandum contains summaries, believed to be accurate, of

offering memorandum, investors acknowledge that they have had an opportunity to request for review, and have
received, all additional information they deem necessary to verify the accuracy and completeness of the

considered legal, business, financial, investment, tax or other advice. Prospective investors should consult their
own counsel, accountants and other advisors as to legal, business, financial, investment, tax and other aspects of
a purchase of the Temporary Notes or the Additional Notes. In making an investment decision, investors must
rely on their own examination of the Issuer and its affiliates, the terms of the offering of any of the Temporary
Notes or the Additional Notes, and the merits and risks involved.

In addition, for so long as the Temporary Notes or the Additional Notes are listed on the Official List of the
Exchange and the rules and regulations of the Authority so require, the Issuer will also provide a copy of the
foregoing information and reports to the Exchange. Furthermore, for so long as any of the Temporary Notes or
the Additional Notes remain outstanding and are “restricted securities” within the meaning of Rule 144(a)(3)
under the Securities Act, the Issuer will, during any period in which the Issuer is neither subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
Act”), nor exempt from such reporting requirements under Rule 12g3-2(b) of the Exchange Act, as amended,
make available to the holder or beneficial owner of such restricted securities or to any prospective purchaser of
such restricted securities designated by such holder or beneficial owner, in each case upon the request of such
holder, beneficial owner or prospective purchaser, the information required to be provided by Rule 144A(d)(4)
under the Securities Act. Any such request should be directed to the Issuer.

This Offering is being made in reliance upon exemptions from registration under the Securities Act for an offer
and sale of securities that does not involve a public offering. The Temporary Notes, which will be automatically
exchanged for the Additional Notes on or about the Completion Date, and the Notes Guarantees have not been
registered with, recommended by or approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or any other
United States federal, state or foreign securities commission or regulatory authority, nor has any such
commission or regulatory authority reviewed or passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of this offering
memorandum. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw this Offering at any time and to reject any commitment to
subscribe for the Temporary Notes, in whole or in part. The Initial Purchasers also reserve the right to allot less
than the full amount of Temporary Notes sought by investors. The Initial Purchasers and certain related entities
may acquire a portion of the Temporary Notes or the Additional Notes for their own account. Persons into whose
possession this offering memorandum or any of the Temporary Notes or the Additional Notes come must inform
themselves about, and observe any restrictions on, the transfer and exchange of the Temporary Notes and the
Additional Notes. See “Plan of Distribution” and “Transfer Restrictions.”

The laws of certain jurisdictions may restrict the distribution of this offering memorandum and the offer and sale
of the Temporary Notes (including the exchange thereof into Additional Notes on or about the Completion Date).
Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum or any of the Temporary Notes or the Additional Notes
come must inform themselves about, and observe any such restrictions. None of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the
Initial Purchasers, the Temporary Trustee, the Trustee, the Security Agent or the other agents or their respective
representatives is making any representation to any offeree or any purchaser of the Temporary Notes or the
Additional Notes regarding the legality of any investment in the Temporary Notes or the Additional Notes by
such offeree or purchaser under applicable investment or similar laws or regulations. For a further description of
certain restrictions on the offering and sale of the Additional Notes and the distribution of this offering
memorandum, see “Notice to Certain Investors” and “Transfer Restrictions.”

To purchase any of the Temporary Notes or the Additional Notes, investors must comply with all applicable laws
and regulations in force in any jurisdiction in which investors purchase, offer or sell any Temporary Notes or
Additional Notes or possess or distribute this offering memorandum. Investors must also obtain any consent,
approval or permission required by such jurisdiction for investors to purchase, offer or sell any of the Temporary
Notes or the Additional Notes under the laws and regulations in force in any jurisdiction to which investors are
subject. None of the Issuer, its affiliates or the Initial Purchasers will have any responsibility therefor.

No action has been taken by the Initial Purchasers, the Issuer or any other person that would permit an offering of
any of the Temporary Notes or the Additional Notes or the circulation or distribution of this offering
memorandum or any offering materials in relation to the Issuer or their respective affiliates, or any of the
Temporary Notes or the Additional Notes, in any country or jurisdiction where action for that purpose is
required.

The Temporary Notes and the Additional Notes will be issued in fully registered form and will be issued in

MAY OVER ALLOT TEMPORARY NOTES OR ADDITIONAL NOTES OR EFFECT TRANSACTIONS
WITH A VIEW TO SUPPORTING THE MARKET PRICE OF THE TEMPORARY NOTES OR THE

**NOTICE TO CERTAIN INVESTORS**

**United States**

The Temporary Notes (and the Additional Notes into which the Temporary Notes will be exchanged on or about
the Completion Date) will be sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S and within the United
States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A. The Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been
and will not be registered under the Securities Act, and accordingly the Temporary Notes, the Additional Notes
and the Notes Guarantees may not be offered or sold within the United States, except pursuant to an exemption
from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. See “Transfer
_Restrictions.”_

**NOTICE TO CERTAIN EUROPEAN INVESTORS**

**PRIIPs Regulation/Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors. The Temporary and the Additional Notes**
are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise
made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one
(or both) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended,
“MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (the “Insurance Distribution
Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1)
of MiFID II. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) 1286/2014 (as amended,
the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Temporary and the Additional Notes or otherwise making
them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Temporary
and the Additional Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful
under the PRIIPs Regulation. This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of
Temporary and the Additional Notes in any Member State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption
under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the “Prospectus Regulation”) from the requirement to publish a prospectus
for offers of Temporary and the Additional Notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the
purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

**MiFID II Product Governance/Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market. Solely for the**
purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the
Temporary and the Additional Notes, has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Temporary and
the Additional Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and
(ii) all channels for distribution of the Temporary and the Additional Notes to eligible counterparties and
professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Temporary
and the Additional Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration each manufacturer’s target market

assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market
assessment in respect of the Temporary and the Additional Notes (by either adopting or refining each
manufacturer’s target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**United Kingdom**

**Prohibition of Sales to UK Retail Investors. The Temporary and the Additional Notes are not intended to be**
offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any
retail investor in the United Kingdom (“UK”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or
more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”); (ii) a customer within the
meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement
Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of
Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA.
Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Temporary and
the Additional Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and
therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may
be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

**UK MiFIR Product Governance / Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market. Solely for the**
purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the
Temporary and the Additional Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Temporary and
the Additional Notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business
Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for
distribution of the Temporary and the Additional Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are
appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Temporary and the Additional
Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a
distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK
MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of
the Temporary and the Additional Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market
assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

This offering memorandum is being distributed only to, and is directed at (a) persons who are outside the
United Kingdom, (b) persons who have professional experience in matters relating to investments falling within
Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005, as amended (the
“Order”), (c) high net worth entities falling within Article 49(2) of the Order or (d) persons to whom an invitation
or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”)) in connection with the issue or sale of any Temporary or Additional Notes may
otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to
as “relevant persons”). In addition, this communication is, in any event only directed at persons who are
“qualified investors” pursuant to the Prospectus Regulation as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
EUWA (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”). Any person who is not a relevant person should not act or rely on this
document or any of its contents. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum may come are
required by the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers to inform themselves about and to observe such restrictions. This
offering memorandum does not constitute a prospectus for the purposes of the UK Prospectus Regulation and is
therefore not an approved prospectus for the purposes of, and as defined by, the UK Prospectus Regulation (or
Section 85 of the FSMA) and has not been approved by the Financial Conduct Authority or any other competent
authority.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER DATA**

**The Group**

The “Group,” “Assemblin,” “we” or “us” refers to the group of entities comprising Assemblin Financing AB
(publ), and all of its consolidated subsidiaries.

**Financial Statements**

This offering memorandum includes unaudited condensed interim financial statements of the Group (as defined
below) as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 (the “Unaudited Condensed Interim Financial
Statements”) and audited combined financial statements of the Group for the financial years 2017, 2018 and 2019
(the “Audited Combined Financial Statements” and, together with the Unaudited Condensed Interim Financial
Statements, the “Financial Statements”).

The Financial Statements have been prepared as combined financial statements. The preparation of combined
financial statements is a way of illustrating financial information for a group of entities that are not a legal group
but are ultimately owned by the same party. The Financial Statements represent the group of entities comprising
the Group. The formation of the Assemblin Financing AB (publ) group of companies comprised transactions
between entities that were under common control. The Issuer entered into a share purchase agreement dated
November 25, 2019 relating to the sale and purchase of all outstanding shares in Assemblin Holding AB between
its parent company, Midco, as seller, and the Issuer, as buyer. This acquisition was completed on or about the
issue date of the Original Notes, which was December 6, 2019. Since these transactions are not covered by any
IFRS standard, the Group has used the historical financial information of the entities included in the combined
reporting entity when preparing the Financial Statements. All intra-group transactions between legal entities
within the reporting entity have been eliminated. As a result, the combined financial statements represent the
economic activities of the reporting entity that will be formed after the transaction.

IFRS does not specifically address the preparation of combined financial statements. The term “combined
financial statements” refers to financial information prepared by aggregating financial information for entities
under common control that do not meet the definition of a group according to IFRS 10. All entities in the
Financial Statements are under common control via ownership by Midco. A complete register of the entities that
constitute the Group is presented in Note 29 to the Audited Combined Financial Statements.

The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) as adopted by the EU. Further, the Swedish Financial Reporting Board’s recommendation, RFR 1
Supplementary Accounting Rules for Corporate Groups, has been applied. The Financial Statements were
approved for issue by the Board of Directors on January 19, 2021. The Financial Statements appear in the
F-pages of this offering memorandum and should be read in conjunction with the relevant reports of our
independent auditor as such reports relate to the Audited Combined Financial Statements.

Information is provided in this offering memorandum for the last twelve months ended September 30, 2020 (“the
twelve months ended September 30, 2020” or “LTM”). The unaudited combined statement of comprehensive
income information and the other financial information presented as of and for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2019 have been derived by subtracting from the financial information of the audited combined
financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 the comparative financial information of the
unaudited condensed interim financial statements as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, and
adding the financial information of the unaudited condensed interim financial statements as of and for the nine
months ended September 30, 2020. The unaudited condensed statement of profit and loss and the other financial
information presented for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 have been prepared for illustrative
purposes only and are not necessarily representative of our results of operations for any future period or our
financial condition at any future date. This data has been prepared solely for the purpose of this offering
memorandum and is not prepared in the ordinary course of our financial reporting.

From January 1, 2019, we apply IFRS 16 Leases which has an impact on our reported statements of profit or loss,
financial position and presentation of cash flow. In implementing IFRS 16, we selected the modified
retrospective approach as the transition method. As a result, the Unaudited Condensed Interim Financial
Statements and the 2019 financial information contained in the Audited Combined Financial Statements are
prepared after implementing IFRS 16, and the 2018 and 2017 financial information contained in the Audited
Combined Financial Statements is prepared prior to the implementation of IFRS 16. The comparison figures for
2018 and earlier periods have not been restated, and are thus not directly comparable where there are differences
caused by the implementation of IFRS 16. See Note 1 to the Audited Combined Financial Statements.

The financial information included in this offering memorandum is not intended to comply with the applicable
accounting requirements of the Securities Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC which would
apply if the Temporary Notes or the Additional Notes were being registered with the SEC.

The information included in this offering memorandum was not prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the Unites States (“U.S. GAAP”). There could be significant differences between IFRS,
as applied by us, and U.S. GAAP. We neither describe the differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP nor
reconcile our IFRS financial statements to U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, such information is not available to
investors, and investors should consider this in making their investment decision. The financial information
included in this offering memorandum would require the modification, reformulation or exclusion of certain
financial measures. In addition, changes would be required in the presentation of certain other information.

**Non-IFRS Measures**

We have included certain non-IFRS financial measures in this offering memorandum, including EBITA,
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, and certain financial ratios.

Under our presentation:

Š “Adjusted EBITA” means EBITA adjusted for items affecting comparability (including impairment of
rights-of-use assets), which are categorized as acquisition, integration and start-up costs, restructuring costs,
transformation costs and other items affecting comparability, as described under “Management’s Discussion
_and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of_
_Operations—Items Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations.” Adjusted EBITA on a segment basis_
also excludes the impact of IFRS 16 on the combined financial information as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2019 and the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2020 and is presented before
intragroup eliminations.

Š “Adjusted EBITDA” means Adjusted EBITA before depreciation of property, plant and equipment and
right-of-use assets, and after certain lease accounting adjustments to exclude the impact of IFRS 16 on the
combined financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 and the nine months ended
September 30, 2019 and 2020.

Š “Adjusted EBITA Margin” and “Adjusted EBITDA Margin” mean Adjusted EBITA and Adjusted
EBITDA, respectively, divided by net revenue for the period, expressed as a percentage.

Š “Cash Conversion” means Free Cash Flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA.

Š “Changes in Net Working Capital” means the sum of the increase or decrease in inventories, the increase or
decrease in net work in progress, the increase or decrease in total trade receivables, the increase or decrease
in reserve for bad debt, the increase or decrease in other receivables, the increase or decrease in trade
payables and the increase or decrease in other payables for the relevant period.

Š “EBITA” means profit for the year/period excluding tax, net financial items and amortization of intangible
assets. EBITA on a segment basis also excludes the impact of IFRS 16 on the combined financial
information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 and the nine months ended September 30, 2019
and 2020 and is presented before intragroup eliminations.

Š “EBITA Margin” means EBITA divided by net revenue for the period, expressed as a percentage.

Š “Free Cash Flow” means Adjusted EBITDA, less the sum of Changes in Net Working Capital and Net
Capital Expenditures for the period.

Š “Net Capital Expenditures” means investments in intangible and tangible fixed assets, less the sales value
(cash proceeds) of tangible and intangible fixed assets for the period, and including net leasing expenditures
related to vehicles, which primarily relate to our car fleet, and after certain lease accounting adjustments to
exclude the impact of IFRS 16 on the combined financial information for the year ended December 31, 2019
and the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2020.

Š “Net Working Capital” means the sum of inventories, net work in progress, total trade receivables, reserve
for bad debt, other receivables, trade payables and other payables for the relevant period.

Š “Order backlog” means the remaining revenue expected to be recognized from ongoing projects subject to
existing contractual commitments as of the end of the relevant period.

Š “Order intake” means the revenue expected to be recognized on projects from (i) new contractual
commitments entered into during the relevant period, plus (ii) changes during the relevant period to existing
contractual commitments entered into during prior periods.

ix


-----

Š “Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA” means Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted to reflect the pro forma EBITDA
contribution of the Fidelix Acquisition, certain other acquisitions that were not consolidated for the full
twelve months ended September 30, 2020 and operational cost savings initiatives that were completed by
December 31, 2019.

We present EBITA, Adjusted EBITA, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and other
non-IFRS measures referred to above because we believe they assist investors and analysts in comparing our
performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are
indicative of our core operating performance.

The foregoing measures have limitations as analytical tools. Some of these limitations are:

Š they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual
commitments;

Š they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

Š with the exception of net interest expense, they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash
requirements necessary, to service interest or principal payments on our debt;

Š although depreciation and amortization are non-monetary charges, the assets being depreciated and
amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA and similar non-IFRS financial measures do not reflect any cash requirements that would be
required for such replacements;

Š some of the large and unusual expenses we eliminate in calculating EBITA, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITA,
Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and similar non-IFRS financial measures reflect cash
payments that were made, or will be made in the future; and

Š the fact that other companies in our industry may calculate EBITA, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITA, Adjusted
EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and similar non-IFRS financial measures differently than we do,
which limits their usefulness as comparative measures.

We present EBITA, Adjusted EBITA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as we believe they
will be useful to investors and analysts in reviewing our performance and comparing our results to other
operators. However, neither EBITA, Adjusted EBITA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA are
IFRS measures and you are encouraged to evaluate any adjustments to IFRS measures yourself and the reasons
we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. You should not consider EBITA, Adjusted EBITA,
Adjusted EBITDA or Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (a) as an alternative to operating profit/(loss) as a measure of
our operating performance; (b) as an alternative to cashflow from operating and investment activities as a
measure of our ability to meet cash needs; or (c) as an alternative to any other measure of performance under
IFRS. Because of these limitations, as well as further limitations discussed above, the non-IFRS measures
presented should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in
accordance with IFRS. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our results in accordance
with IFRS and using non-IFRS measures only supplementally.

**Financial data for the Guarantors**

This offering memorandum contains certain financial data with respect to revenues, EBITDA and assets of the
Guarantors, including as a percentage of the aggregate net revenue, EBITDA and total assets of the Group (as
derived from our Financial Statements and defined above). This information has been derived from accounting
statements for the Guarantors prepared in accordance with the Swedish accounting standards, and not IFRS,
which is the basis of preparation for our Financial Statements.

**INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

Unless otherwise indicated, statements in this offering memorandum regarding the market environment, market
developments, growth rates, market trends and the competitive situation in the markets and segments in which
we operate are based on data, statistical information, sector reports and studies as well as on our own estimates.

In drafting this offering memorandum, we used industry sources and sources on market data, including reports
prepared by Prognoscentret AB (“Prognoscentret”) and Euroconstruct.

To the extent that information was taken from third parties, such information has been accurately reproduced by
us in this offering memorandum and, as far as we are aware and able to ascertain from the information published
by these third parties, no facts have been omitted which would render the reproduced information inaccurate or
misleading. However, market studies and analyses are frequently based on information and assumptions that may
not be accurate or technically correct, and their methodology may be forward-looking and speculative.

We have not verified the figures, market data and other information used by third parties in the studies,
publications and financial information reproduced herein, or the external sources on which our estimates are
based. We therefore assume no liability for and offer no guarantee of the accuracy of the data from studies and
third-party sources contained in this offering memorandum or for the accuracy of third-party data on which our
estimates are based.

This offering memorandum also contains estimates of market data and information derived from such data that
cannot be obtained from publications by independent sources. Such information is partly based on our own
market observations, the evaluation of industry information (such as from conferences and sector events) or
internal assessments. We believe that our estimates of market data and the information we have derived from
such data helps investors to better understand the industry in which we operate and our position within it. Our
own estimates have not been checked or verified externally. While we assume that our own market observations
are reliable, we give no warranty for the accuracy of our own estimates and the information derived from them.
They may differ from estimates made by our competitors or from other independent sources. While we are not
aware of any misstatements regarding the industry or similar data presented herein, such data involves risks and
uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, including those discussed under the heading
“Risk Factors” in this offering memorandum. As a result, neither we nor the Initial Purchasers make any
representation as to the accuracy or completeness of any such information in this offering memorandum.

**EXCHANGE RATES**

The following tables set forth, for the periods set forth below, the high, low, average and period end Bloomberg
Generic Composite Rates expressed as U.S. dollar per €1.00 and Swedish krona per €1.00. The Bloomberg
Generic Composite Rate is a “best market” calculation, in which, at any point in time, the bid rate is equal to the
highest bid rate of all contributing bank indications and the ask rate is set to the lowest ask rate offered by these
banks. The Bloomberg Generic Composite Rate is a mid-value rate between the applied highest bid rate and the
lowest ask rate. The rates may differ from the actual rates used in the preparation of the combined financial
statements and other financial information appearing in this offering memorandum. None of the Issuer, the
Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers represent that the U.S. dollar, Swedish krona or euro amounts referred to
below could be or could have been converted into U.S. dollars, Swedish krona or euros at any particular rate
indicated or any other rate.

The average rate for a year, a month or for any shorter period, means the average of the daily Bloomberg Generic
Composite Rates during that year, month or shorter period, as the case may be. On January 18, 2021, the
Bloomberg Generic Composite Rate between the euro and the Swedish krona was SEK 10.1287 per €1.00.

**Overview**

We are one of the Nordic region’s leading providers of complete installation and service solutions, with our
primary activities focusing on electrical engineering, heating and sanitation, ventilation and automation, as well
as key competencies in data and telecom, industrial pipes, district heating, cooling, sprinklers, security and
electrical workshop and field services. We hold a strong position in the growing installation market in the Nordic
region (comprising Sweden, Norway and Finland), which are estimated at approximately SEK 98 billion, SEK
75 billion and SEK 59 billion, respectively, and have a combined approximate value of SEK 231 billion as of
December 31, 2019, and in 2019, we had the second largest share of Sweden’s installation market by revenue
according to Prognoscentret. Moreover, in December 2020, we entered into a sale and purchase agreement to
acquire Fidelix, a technology-driven building automation service company, which is expected to provide us with
a market-leading position within the building automation market in the Nordics.

We provide installation and service assignments in various types of properties, industrial facilities and
infrastructure projects for a diverse customer base consisting over 20,000 large and small customers, which
include construction companies, the public sector, property owners and industrial companies. Our strong
relationships with our customers have contributed to an order backlog of SEK 8,245 million and an LTM order
intake of SEK 9,859 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2020, and we currently have over 3,000 ongoing
projects. We take on primarily two types of assignments: contractor assignments and service assignments. The
proportion of contractor assignments and service assignments represented 60% and 40%, respectively, of our net
revenue for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020.

Our operations are decentralized and governed based on a shared framework, clear allocation of roles and
responsibilities and systematic monitoring. Our current operating organization is divided into five specific
business areas: three in Sweden (Assemblin El, Assemblin VS and Assemblin Ventilation), one in Norway
(Assemblin Norway) and one in Finland (Assemblin Finland), comprising over 166 branches across over 100
locations with over 5,800 employees in the Nordic region. We believe that our decentralized business model
contributes to the profitability of our operations. This decentralized and entrepreneurial business model allows us
to swiftly adjust to a largely variable cost structure and promotes enterprise and accountability at all levels of our
structure with the president of each business area being responsible, together with their management groups, for
the operations and earnings in their respective business areas.

The following map shows the branch footprint of our business areas, representing the locations in which we
operated in the Nordic region as of September 30, 2020.

We have been owned by Triton Partners since 2015, and since then have expanded our geographical presence and
volumes through the acquisition of 40 additional companies to date (excluding Fidelix), the largest of which
being a carve-out from construction company Skanska, Skanska Installation, acquired in 2016. Our organic and
inorganic growth has made us into a complete installation and service partner, with the strength of a
multidisciplinary group and the personal presence of a local company.

In the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, we had total net revenue of SEK 10,133 million, a net profit for
the period of SEK 42 million, EBITA of SEK 304 million, Adjusted EBITA of SEK 569 million and Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA of SEK 851 million. This was supported by our strong order backlog, which stood at SEK
8,245 million as of September 30, 2020.

The table below sets out the net revenue, Adjusted EBITA (and corresponding margin), order backlog, share of
service assignments, average number of FTE employees and number of branches for each of our business areas
as of and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020.

**Competitive Strengths**

We believe that the following are our key strengths:

**_Top Nordic player focused on regional leadership_**

We are a leading provider of complete installation and service solutions in electrical engineering, heating and
sanitation, ventilation and automation in the Nordic region. We hold a strong position in the growing installation
market in Sweden, Norway and Finland, estimated at approximately SEK 231 billion as of December 31, 2019,
and in 2019, we had the second largest share of Sweden’s installation market by revenue according to
Prognoscentret. In addition, we believe we hold the number one position in the Oslo heating and sanitation
market, and a top 5 position in Finland. Moreover, we expect the acquisition of Fidelix to provide us with a
market-leading position within the building automation market in the Nordics.

We are outperforming the market and gaining market share; specifically, in 2019, we held the second largest
market share (8.4%) of the estimated SEK 98 billion installation market in Sweden, representing a market share
increase of 75 basis points between 2017 and 2019. Our presence in Norway and Finland has also shown strong
growth, with our market share (1.6%) of the estimated SEK 75 billion installation market in Norway increasing
by 44 basis points between 2017 and 2019, and our market share (1%) of the estimated SEK 59 billion
installation market in Finland increasing by 8 basis points over the same period. We have operated through our
constituent subsidiaries in our key markets of Sweden, Norway and Finland for more than half a century and
have a track record of completing contracts on time and in line with customer specifications, which is
underpinned by our commitment to attaining the highest levels of customer satisfaction. We believe that brand
awareness and market reputation are key factors for customers deciding upon a particular installation and
services provider and that our established portfolio and track record, therefore, provide us with a significant
competitive advantage.

Importantly, we have developed high network density in our chosen markets, including nation-wide Sweden, the
greater Oslo area (Norway) and in the Helsinki-Turku-Tampere triangle (Finland), with our footprint tailored to
maximize regional leadership in an industry where local scale matters. Our market presence and the scale and
geographic reach of our operations give us a clear advantage over our competitors, which in our fragmented
market comprise mostly small or medium-sized enterprises. This is particularly the case with respect to contracts
for major projects, which typically generate stable revenue streams and cash flows, as we are one of only a small
number of companies in our markets with sufficient resources and expertise to be mandated on, and successfully
execute, such contracts due to the scale, diversity and quality of our installation and service offering.

Our geographic reach has enabled us to attain significant market positions in the regions where we operate,
particularly in Sweden where, in terms of 2017 net revenue, we had nine regions ranked either number one or
number two in electrical engineering, ten in heating and sanitation and six in ventilation. Only one of our
competitors had more regions ranked higher in these categories than Assemblin in Sweden.

Our Group and local scale provide differentiating competitive advantages. At the Group level, we are able to
utilize our procurement expertise to optimize sourcing supplier terms within each business area and leverage on
our digital capabilities. In addition, we leverage certain central functions such as finance, legal, communication
and our central IT platform. At the local level, our geographic network comprises over 166 branches across over
100 locations in the Nordic region, in close proximity to our customers. In certain locations, our business areas
share branch premises allowing for significant cross-selling and cost-reduction opportunities. In addition to being
better positioned to win local tenders, our cross-staffing ability between branches allows us to optimize project
selection. Further, our local scale has allowed us to build a workforce of over 5,800 employees in the Nordic
region with many employees preferring to work for a larger company due to supportive and clear governance,
stability, brand awareness and personal development opportunities.

**_Execution excellence delivered by local branch managers and specialist staff_**

We believe that our decentralized business model contributes to the profitability of our operations. Our current
operating organization is divided into five specific business areas (Assemblin El, Assemblin VS, Assemblin
Ventilation, Assemblin Norway and Assemblin Finland), which in turn consist of regions, divisions and branches
where local decision making and project execution is undertaken. This decentralized and entrepreneurial business
model allows us to swiftly adjust our largely variable cost structure (see “—Resilient and agile business model”)
and promotes entrepreneurial culture and accountability at all levels of our structure with the president of each
business area being responsible, together with their management groups, for the operations and earnings in their
respective business areas.

We believe that one of our key strengths is the division of our business by business area instead of by region. The
focus on business areas allows our managers and their teams to prioritize their technical areas of expertise, it
provides career development opportunities for our talented employees within their respective business lines, as
well as it is also an important advantage in the mergers and acquisition context where the typical target company
has one technical discipline, allowing the target company to join the appropriate part of our business which
focuses on the target’s core strength. For example, we expect the Fidelix Group to be an independent business
area within the Group, and Fidelix’s experienced management team will continue to play a critical role in
Fidelix’s ongoing operations to help ensure continued success.

Through our decentralized business model, our branch managers are incentivized to create value and lead a
specialized and skilled workforce. Specifically, the interplay between specialist staff and strongly incentivized
branch managers has led to improved profitability. Our specialist staff are supported by the Assemblin Academy
and compulsory web courses to enhance their skillsets. In addition, employees are guided by clear development
plans and career ladders, which, in turn, allows us to attract top quality employees. The focus on incentivizing
specialist staff through measures such as the Assemblin Academy as well as our staff incentive plan has
contributed to industry leading employee satisfaction at Assemblin, underpinning our ability to retain specialist
staff. Specifically, in 2019, we achieved an employee net promoter score (“NPS”) of 18, compared to 4 in 2012,
which was substantially higher than the industry average of 9. Furthermore, we have an employer reputation
score of 3.3 in Sweden, which is the highest among our key competitors.

On the branch manager side, branch managers’ decision-making is based on their in-depth local market
knowledge and customer relationships supported by a specialized staff allowing branch managers to reduce costs
and provide a geared installation and service offering to customers. Branch managers are strongly incentivized on
EBITA Margin targets as well as efficient working capital management.

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, enhanced monitoring at the branch level has allowed successful
management of market and operational challenges stemming from COVID-19 restrictions. We have also
experienced successful management of personnel shortfall due to sick leaves during COVID-19 through effective
reallocation between assignments, allowing us to continue relying on our specialist staff.

As a result of our investment in specialist staff and incentivizing our branch managers, the proportion of lossmaking branches has reduced from 38% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 19% for the year ended
December 31, 2019, and these branches contributed only 14% of our net revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2019. The proportion of branches delivering over 7% of EBITA Margin has increased over the
same period from 22% to 40%. The table below outlines the split of branches’ profitability level by EBITA
Margin for the periods indicated, based on management estimates.

Further, our branch managers’ project execution is underpinned by well-established controls which allow us to
execute our decentralized business model. Branch managers are continuously supported and monitored at the


4


-----

regional, business area and Group level to ensure appropriate risk management and improved profitability. This
support is carried out by, among other things, project selection controls and project execution controls.

In relation to project selection, tenders are approved based on project size, assuming standard contractual terms.
Projects under €1 million can be approved directly by the branch office, with projects between €1 million to
€2 million and €2 million to €5 million required to be approved at the region and business level, respectively.
Projects between €5 million to €10 million must be approved at the Group level and contracts over €10 million
are required to be approved by our Board. With respect to project execution, branches are supported by an
established system of financial, internal and management controls.

**_High revenue visibility from project backlog and recurring services_**

Our ability to sustain profitable operations is underpinned in large part by our strong project backlog and high
incidence of recurring services, which together provide high revenue visibility. This high revenue visibility
allows us to take a more stringent approach in our margin selection criteria. Our order intake volumes grow our
backlog over time. Between September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2020, our order intake increased by 7.1% to
SEK 7,252 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, compared to SEK 6,774 million during the
nine months ended September 30, 2018. Moreover, we experienced our highest annual order intakes to date in
the year ended December 31, 2019, reaching SEK 11,258 million (compared to SEK 9,459 million in 2018),
which was driven in particular by two large orders: the Stockholm Bypass project from the Swedish
Transportation Administration and the new health care building in the Malmö hospital district, which contributed
SEK 520 million and SEK 867 million, respectively, to our order intake during that period. Order backlog as of
September 30, 2020 was SEK 8,245 million, compared to SEK 6,780 million as of September 30, 2018, and the
order intake for 2019 resulted in our reaching our highest annual order intake to date of SEK 8,478 million as of
December 31, 2019. Beginning as early as January 1 of every year, our order backlog provides visibility of more
than 50% of our annual project revenues (excluding service revenues).

The following table sets out our existing project backlog for the periods indicated.

September 30, 2020 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8,245

We take a consistent approach to order booking and only include signed contracts in our order backlog. Even
when new contracts appear highly likely to be awarded as a result of our Integrated Project Delivery (“IPD”) (see
“Business—Competitive Strengths”) pipeline, we exclude them until they are signed. In addition, the lead time on
our backlog projects has been increasingly extended due to capacity constraints, which now requires customers to
book projects earlier on. We currently hold a strong pipeline of large, more technical and publicly-funded
contracts due to current structural needs for schools, hospitals and transport infrastructures in the Nordic region.

We also benefit from an increasingly high rate of recurring service business and have experienced a meaningful
increase in the conversion rate from project assignments, which primarily consist of new installation or the
redevelopment of, and adaptations to, technical systems in buildings, plants, to service assignments, which
comprise the operation, maintenance, repair, replacement, reconfiguration and monitoring of installations in
buildings, plants and infrastructure. For example, the net revenue of our service business increased from
SEK 2,922 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 to SEK 3,833 million in the year ended December 31,
2019, representing 35.8% and 38.4% of our total net revenue of SEK 8,169 million and SEK 9,978 million
respectively. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, the net revenue of our service business was
SEK 4,007 million, which represented 39.5% of our net revenue of SEK 10,133 million during this period. This


5


-----

increased service contribution improves our budget accuracy and drives profitable growth, particularly in the
case of recurring services, which pose high barriers to entry for our competitors at the contract renewal stage.

We endeavor to maximize client satisfaction and retention by taking a strategic approach to each customer
relationship. This approach begins by establishing multiple touch points with the customer and developing a deep
understanding of the client’s needs. Next, we offer a state-of-the-art digital platform that allows for continuous
performance monitoring and improvement throughout each assignment. Finally, we provide a comprehensive
breadth of service offerings and aim for performance beyond customer expectations in order to increase the
likelihood of recurring service contracts going forward.

**_Resilient and agile business model_**

Our decentralized and entrepreneurial business model allows us to swiftly adjust our largely variable cost
structure. Installation is the last part of the typical construction project, with multi-technical service providers
having solid predictability of the project pipeline. As a result of our late stage involvement in projects, branch
managers are able to identify early signs in the changes of market dynamics and adjust our variable cost base as
necessary. Our ability to proactively manage or swiftly react to such changes in market dynamics is supported by
our lean and decentralized operational organization of five business areas in three countries, spread across over
166 branches. Approximately 89% of our cost structure during the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 was
variable or semi-variable, which provides us with substantial operational flexibility. Additionally, although to
date the installation market has proved to be relatively resilient to the COVID-19 pandemic and we believe the
underlying drivers for long-term growth remain, we have experienced increased competition due to more
uncertain market conditions. In light of this uncertainty, we believe it is beneficial to be a large, stable player
with an ability to identify and react quickly to market changes, which we believe our leading market position,
strong financial position and decentralized business model allows us to achieve.

Further, branch managers have a diverse end-market exposure with a high share of service assignments and mainly
smaller projects. Based on our end-market analysis conducted for our largest business areas, Electrical and
Heating & Sanitation, in terms of net revenue, between January 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020, a large part of our
net revenue originated from cycle-resilient end-markets such as healthcare (10%), education & culture (8%),
infrastructure (2%) and service assignments (42%). Further, we had limited exposure to the Swedish residential
market as approximately 12% of our end-market exposure was attributable to project assignments in the residential
market, with new residential builds representing an estimate of less than 5% of our total project revenue. Other
limited end-market exposures include business (3%), offices (9%), hospitality (2%), warehouses (2%) and industrial
(8%). Our business also has limited dependency on a specific customer or type of contract. According to the
Group’s management estimates, our top ten customers accounted for approximately 30% of our net revenue for the
for the year ended December 31, 2019. Further, based on net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019,
projects (which includes both installation projects as well as certain service projects subject to percentage of
completion accounting) under SEK 50 million, between SEK 50-100 million, over SEK 100 million represented
56%, 5%, 3% of our net revenue, respectively and the remaining 36% being other service assignments.

Following Triton’s acquisition of the Group, we have pursued a strategy of low-risk and accretive bolt-on
acquisitions in order to expand our business. Specifically, with Triton as our owner, we have grown through the
acquisition of 40 additional companies (excluding Fidelix), the largest of which being a carve-out from
construction company Skanska, Skanska Installation, acquired in 2016. The rest of our acquisitions comprised
companies with an average revenue of approximately SEK 48 million and 25 employees. When completing an
acquisition, we anticipate paying a multiple of approximately 4-6 times the target’s EBITA, consistent with the
multiple for our recent historical acquisitions. For more information, see “—History.” We believe that our
established track-record of low-risk bolt-on acquisitions in a consolidating market has allowed us to successfully
realize synergies and integrate the workforce, and we intend to continue to pursue acquisitions in order to
increase our market presence, our service offering and our service capacity.

**_Established track-record of improving margin and Free Cash Flow generation_**

Our profit has increased from SEK 22 million in 2017 to SEK 42 million for the twelve months ended September
30, 2020. Our Adjusted EBITA Margin has increased significantly from 3.1% in 2017 to 5.6% in the twelve
months ended September 30, 2020. Our ability to address market demand and new customer orders as well as our
focus on empowering branch managers and providing fixed services at the Group level have enabled us to
improve profitability. We have also started benefitting from the completion of our accelerated profitability
program, which we completed at the end of 2019 and was targeted to optimize our branch network, reduce
overhead expenditures and improve operational efficiency. Further, we achieved strong Free Cash Flow

EBITDA. Changes in Net Working Capital is defined as the sum of the increase or decrease in inventories, the increase or decrease in net
work in progress, the increase or decrease in total trade receivables, the increase or decrease in reserve for bad debt, the increase or
decrease in other receivables, the increase or decrease in trade payables and the increase or decrease in other payables for the relevant
period.

reconciliation of these non-IFRS measures to IFRS financial information, see “Summary—Summary Combined Financial and Other
_Information—Operating Data and Non-IFRS Financial Information.”_

Our high cash flow generation has been driven by our capital-lite operations together with efficient working
capital management. Our operations require very limited capital expenditure, which primarily comprises tools,
refurbishment and IT, with our Net Capital Expenditure representing 0.8% of net revenue for the twelve months
ended September 30, 2020. Our service vehicle fleet which is directly linked to the growth of our service
operations is being arranged through flexible financial lease arrangements. We have a high focus on working
capital management across the Group and as a result our Net Working Capital has been negative, being negative
SEK 173 million, or 2.1% as a percentage of net revenue (SEK 8,169 million) for the year ended December 31,
2017, negative SEK 363 million, or 4.1% as a percentage of net revenue (SEK 8,885 million) for the year ended
December 31, 2018, negative SEK 391 million, or 3.9% as a percentage of net revenue (SEK 9,978 million) for
the year ended December 31, 2019 and negative SEK 493 million, or 4.9% as a percentage of net revenue (SEK
10,133 million) for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020. For the definition of Net Working Capital, see
“Presentation of Financial and Other Data—Non-IFRS Measures.” Our ability to generate Free Cash Flow has
contributed to our growth and has allowed us to undertake our mergers and acquisition strategy and achieve
deleveraging, including since the issuance of the Original Notes as demonstrated by the decrease in our ratio of
total net debt to pro forma Adjusted EBITDA from 4.3x to 3.5x as of September 30, 2020 (without giving pro
forma effect to this Offering). We believe that our successful and proven business model, combined with our
well-established long-term customer relationships, will enable us to continue to achieve profitable growth and
deleverage going forward.

**_An experienced and established management team_**

Our management team consists of experienced professionals with strong backgrounds and operational expertise
in installation and service solutions and a proven track record of acquiring and integrating new businesses. Our
Chief Executive Officer, Mats Johansson, our Chief Financial Officer, Philip Carlson, and our business area chief
executive officers have over 20 years of industry experience, on average. Our management team is supported by
a highly experienced Board, and we also benefit from the extensive market expertise, business relationships and
ongoing strong support of our shareholder, Triton.

**Our Strategy**

We target to be the best installation company in the Nordic region. To achieve our goals, we intend to pursue the
following strategies:

**_Continue to focus on profitable growth by selectively developing our regional leadership and becoming the_**
**_most attractive employer in the industry_**

We are determined to grow our business profitably and sustainably. This means that we will be mindful of
winning market shares and new contracts without compromising on profitability.

We believe that we are well positioned to grow our leading local market positions throughout the Nordic region
and strong local market positions by continuing to provide high-quality services and support to our customers
and employees, and by focusing on our local operations.

We intend to continue to operate a large, decentralized organization, with local branch units operating as
individual profit centers. Maintaining a well-established, local presence throughout the Nordic region also
provides our customers with a large number of local access points. We intend to continue to leverage our strong
customer relationships and local market knowledge to meet our customers’ needs promptly and efficiently, in
order to establish ourselves as the provider of choice in the markets in which we operate.

We will enhance growth by targeting attractive local markets and remaining agile and flexible when it comes to
our footprint so that capital and human resources are always allocated in the most accretive way. We will also
continue to invest in markets where Assemblin is or has the ability to become the largest or second-largest
operator so that we can leverage competitively our scale advantages and Group capabilities while strengthening
our high customer intimacy.

Our employees are key to maintaining and growing our leading-market positions. We intend to utilize our
reputation and intensify our brand awareness to continue to recruit and retain the best talents in the industry and
to position ourselves as the employer of choice. We will also keep track and improve the performance of our
existing managers and technicians by continuing to develop professional and technical training programs and by
assigning our engineers and technicians to a wide range of fields. Strengthening the competence of middle
management is paramount and we are achieving, and will continue to do so, through our Group-wide leadership
model and an improved new structure process for succession planning. We will finally continue to incentivize
our managers and technicians by maintaining a performance-based compensation structure focused on profits and
cash generation rather than volume growth.

**_Continue to focus on absolute margin expansion through operational excellence and economies of scale_**

Our profitability has substantially improved since Triton invested in Assemblin. However, we believe that there
is scope to continue to increase our absolute margin level.

While we differentiate our offering by providing consistent, high-quality installation and technical services and
offering a wide range of services to our customers, we are also able to drive cost savings by driving best practices
across our Group.

In 2019, we completed our accelerated profitability improvement program targeted to optimize our branch
network, reduce overhead expenditures and improve operational efficiency. This program provided us with
tangible cost savings in 2019, and we intend to consolidate and build on the improvements achieved so far.

Additionally, to continue to improve our margins and cash flow, we intend to continue focusing on project
selection and execution to allow us to operate more efficiently and profitably in the short-term while reducing
project risk in the long-term. Over time, we are also gaining a better understanding of key success factors and
best practices by analyzing the operational data and profitability metrics on a project by project basis. We
achieve this by measuring branch profitability and by creating a corporate culture where profitability is rewarded
over volume. Execution-wise, we have a clear project governance scheme so that the right resources are allocated
to each project while the adequate communication channels will relay relevant information across the Group.

-----

**_Continue to focus on recurring revenues_**

We believe that the diversity of our customers and our contract portfolio across our operating segments result in
strong, recurring revenues, which help us withstand negative business cycles in any single aspect of our business.
We intend to increase our share of recurring projects with all of our customers by continuing to focus increasing
our maintenance service revenues. We intend to extend this strategy to the companies we acquire, including
Fidelix, whose strong track record of double-digit margins and large and growing installed base further supports
profitability through its aftermarket and cloud businesses.

We also plan to maintain a balance between our installation and services businesses and to continue to capitalize
on our ability to provide add-on maintenance services following the completion of our installation projects as
those tend to be recurring and more predictable by nature.

**_Pursue an accretive bolt-on acquisition growth strategy focused on the right cultural fit with our business_**

The Nordic installation market is highly fragmented and represents a compelling opportunity to grow our
business while generating cost synergies and enhancing price discipline in the market.

We continually evaluate opportunities to acquire and integrate other installation and technical services providers
in the Nordic region in order to strengthen our local competitive position, broaden the range of our offering and
increase our presence in our existing markets. We believe we have significant experience in identifying,
executing and integrating acquisitions while remaining focused on our existing business. We also believe the
acquisition of Fidelix will provide us with a platform for further acquisition-led growth, especially given
Fidelix’s track-record of successful bolt-on acquisitions.

Our focus on technical disciplines allows us to better approach likely targets and provide a compelling view of a
common future. We intend to continue to grow through strategic bolt-on acquisitions but we will prioritize
targets where a good cultural fit with our business which limits integration risk and improves staff retention that
is crucial considering the local, relationship-driven nature of our activity.

**_Accelerate the digitalization of our business in order to find solutions that increase customer benefit and_**
**_internal efficiency, in line with the secular trends we observe in our industry_**

We take an active part in the digital transformation of the building and installation industry. Buildings are
increasingly connected and involve smart, interconnected and automated technical systems. This represents a
substantial growth opportunity for our business that we strive to take advantage of. In particular, the acquisition
of Fidelix brings additional digitalization capabilities across the Group, which we expect to be a driver as we
focus on the next-generation of installation across all of our business areas.

Digitalization, however, does not only underpin our long-term growth profile, it is also an opportunity to connect
construction sites to better inform decision-making and foster a closer collaboration across our teams but also
with the various parties which we collaborate with on a construction site.

Each of our business areas has dedicated digitalization managers mapping local initiatives and driving local
digitalization efforts. Our central steering group involves members from all business areas and prioritizes
initiatives according to Assemblin’s digital agenda. Our key successes have historically been on our market
leading expertise in Building Information Modelling (“BIM”) where Assemblin has around 16 years of
experience. This type of modelling is currently used both in large and small projects, improves clarity to all
stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle, and makes it easier to achieve project and business goals. Other
digital tools we have developed includes Assemblin eManageri which is a smart platform helping property
managers and owners to monitor and manage energy efficiency in properties.

**_Continue to leverage “Sustainability” initiatives_**

As energy prices rise and concerns over climate change increase, local, regional and national authorities,
corporates and the public are increasingly demanding socially responsible energy consumption. We believe that
we are well positioned to take advantage of growth in the “green economy.” The energy consumption of a
building is significantly influenced by the design of its electrical, heating and plumbing, and HVAC systems. As


9


-----

a leading Nordic installer and service provider of those systems, we are able to support customers seeking to
optimize energy utilization in both new and existing buildings. We also offer energy efficiency solutions for
different types of power distribution. We aim at increasing our revenues attributable to the “green economy” by
further developing innovative installation and service offerings in the area of energy efficiency. We also believe
that Fidelix will be accretive to us in this respect given that its technology-driven building automation services
serve to optimize building performance both from a cost and environmental perspective, while providing the
building users with a healthier indoor environment.

**The Sponsor**

Founded in 1997, Triton is a private equity investment firm in the German-speaking and Nordic regions with
12 offices including Jersey, London, Frankfurt, Stockholm, Luxembourg and Shanghai. Its investment
philosophy is focused around building better businesses and producing superior investment returns based on
operational improvement and ‘‘buy and build’’ value-creation strategies. Triton has more than €14 billion of
committed capital across its funds and seeks to invest in market-leading companies with strong long-term
prospects in its core sectors of industrial manufacturing, business services and consumer/health services.

Triton’s business services team invests in a range of businesses from multidisciplinary installation services, food
logistics and storage providers to shipping companies. Since 2002, Triton has made 27 investments in the
business services sector totaling approximately €2.9 billion. In 2013, Triton established its Triton Fund IV with
investors committing a total of €3.55 billion to the fund. Assemblin was acquired through Triton Fund IV in
November 2015.

**The Transactions**

We collectively refer to the Fidelix Acquisition, the Sponsor Investment, the upsize of the revolving
commitments under the Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities Agreement, the Offering and the payment of
related fees and expenses as the “Transactions.”

On or about the Completion Date, we expect to use the gross proceeds of the Offering, together with the proceeds
from the Sponsor Investment, to (a) finance the cash consideration payable to the Sellers in connection with the
Fidelix Acquisition (including the purchase price, certain other purchase price adjustments under the Fidelix
Acquisition Agreement and the repayment of certain debt of the Target), (b) pay transaction costs associated with
the Transactions and (c) fund cash on balance sheet, including potential acquisitions.

**_The Fidelix Acquisition_**

On December 8, 2020, Assemblin AB entered into a sale and purchase agreement (the “Fidelix Acquisition
Agreement”) to acquire (the “Fidelix Acquisition”) Fidelix Holding Oy (the “Target” or “Fidelix”) from the
shareholders and option rights holders in Fidelix (the “Sellers”). The Fidelix Acquisition is subject to approval
from the Finnish competition authority.

The Fidelix Acquisition Agreement provides for an initial cash consideration payable on the Completion Date to
the Sellers, subject to purchase price adjustments in accordance with the terms of the Fidelix Acquisition
Agreement. We also expect to repay certain outstanding indebtedness of the Target. We estimate the aggregate
cash consideration for the Fidelix Acquisition to be approximately €92 million (or approximately SEK 965
million).

On or about the Completion Date, the Issuer will use a portion of the proceeds from the Offering to finance the
cash consideration payable to the Sellers in connection with the Fidelix Acquisition.

**_The Sponsor Investment_**

In connection with the Fidelix Acquisition, the Sponsor will contribute €20 million (or approximately SEK 210
million) in cash (the “Sponsor Investment”) through intermediate holding companies to the Group on or about
the Completion Date in the form of an equity contribution.

-----

**_The Offering and Escrow; Release and Automatic Exchange_**

The Issuer is issuing the Temporary Notes on the Issue Date in anticipation of the Fidelix Acquisition occurring
on the Completion Date. The Initial Purchasers will, concurrently with the issuance of the Temporary Notes on
the Issue Date, deposit with the Escrow Agent an amount equal to the gross proceeds of the Offering sold on the
Issue Date into the Escrow Account. The Escrow Account will be controlled by the Escrow Agent. The Escrow
Account, together with the Escrowed Property, will be pledged on a first-priority basis in favor of the Temporary
Trustee or the Security Agent for the benefit of the holders of the Temporary Notes, pursuant to the Escrow
Account Charge. From the Issue Date until the Temporary Notes Exchange, each of the Temporary Notes will be
solely secured by a first-priority security interest over the Escrow Account Charge. The release of the escrowed
proceeds will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the Fidelix Acquisition being required
to be consummated promptly following the release of the escrowed proceeds from the Escrow Account. See
“Description of the Temporary Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” The Temporary
Notes will not be guaranteed.

If the Fidelix Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to September 3, 2021 (the “Escrow Longstop Date”), or
upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Temporary Notes will be subject to a Special Mandatory
Redemption. The Special Mandatory Redemption price of the Temporary Notes will be equal to 100% of the
aggregate issue price of the Temporary Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest then required to be paid under the
Temporary Notes, if any, from the Issue Date to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date. See
“Description of the Temporary Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” and “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to the Fidelix Acquisition—If the conditions to the release of the proceeds of the Offering_
_set forth in the Escrow Agreement are not satisfied, the Temporary Notes will be redeemed and you may not get_
_the return you expect on the Temporary Notes.”_

On or about the Completion Date, the Temporary Notes will be automatically exchanged for an equal aggregate
principal amount of Additional Notes and the escrowed proceeds will be released (the “Temporary Notes
Exchange”). In addition, upon the Temporary Notes Exchange, the Issuer and the Guarantors will extend and/or
confirm the extension of the Collateral to cover the Additional Notes, which pursuant to the Intercreditor
Agreement, will benefit from the same ranking as the liens securing the Original Notes. Furthermore, upon the
Temporary Notes Exchange, the Guarantees will benefit the Additional Notes. In addition, subject to the Agreed
Security Principles, within 60 business days of the Completion Date, the Original Notes and the Additional Notes
will be secured by the Post-Completion Collateral.

The Temporary Notes will be issued by the Issuer under the Temporary Indenture. The Additional Notes will be
issued as additional notes under the Indenture (pursuant to which the Original Notes were issued on the Original
Issue Date). The Temporary Notes will have the same terms as the Original Notes, except as described herein.
The Temporary Notes will trade separately from the Original Notes, will have different ISIN/common code
numbers than the Original Notes and will not be fungible with the Original Notes. The Additional Notes will
have the same terms as the Original Notes and will be treated as a single class together with the Original Notes
for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers
to purchase. After giving effect to the issuance of the Additional Notes, the aggregate principal amount of Notes
outstanding under the Indenture will be €350.0 million.

**_Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities Upsize_**

The Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities Agreement provides for borrowings under the Revolving Credit
Facility of up to an aggregate principal amount of SEK 450 million on a committed basis, which is expected to be
increased to SEK 640 million on the Completion Date. We do not expect that we will draw any cash amounts
under the Revolving Credit Facility on the Completion Date. For a more detailed description of the Revolving
Credit and Guarantee Facilities Agreement, see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—The Super
_Senior Facilities.”_

**Fidelix**

**_Overview of Fidelix Business_**

Fidelix was founded in 2002 and has since grown into a technology-driven building automation service company
with a leading market position in the Nordics. Using in-house developed technology, Fidelix covers the full value
chain, from sales and deployment of products and systems, to cloud and aftermarket services. Fidelix currently
operates in Finland and Sweden (accounting for approximately 70% and 30% of Fidelix’s 2020 net sales,
respectively, based on Fidelix’s management accounts and before intragroup eliminations), with 20 regional
offices and over 300 employees. Its experienced management team will be integrated within the Group and will
continue to play a critical role in Fidelix’s ongoing operations to support continued success.

Fidelix offers building management systems (“BMS”) for commercial buildings by combining hardware and
software from its product portfolio to optimize building performance both from a cost and environmental
perspective, while providing the building users with a healthier indoor environment. Fidelix also provides
metering, cloud and IoT solutions for residential buildings (referred to as individual metering and debiting or
“IMD”) through EcoGuard, which it acquired in April 2019.

Fidelix provides its BMS and IMD services to a well-diversified customer base. Its customers include both public
(representing almost half of its orderbook as of June 2020 based on Fidelix’s management accounts) and private
end-customers across the commercial and residential market, for both new builds and renovations (accounting for
over 40% and 55%, respectively, of net sales in 2019 based on Fidelix’s management accounts). Fidelix’s project
portfolio includes both relatively large and small projects, with Fidelix’s management estimating that over 60%
of its completed and ongoing projects individually generated sales of less than €200,000. As a result, Fidelix is
able to cover a wider installed base, which totaled approximately 26,500 buildings as of January 2020 (based on
Fidelix management’s estimates), approximately 15,500 of which comprise its BMS installed base (in Sweden
and Finland), with the remainder comprising its IMD installed based (in Sweden). Fidelix’s installed base serves
as a conduit for its aftermarket and cloud businesses and provides references and expertise across building types
and deeper visibility into market outlook.

Its three operational segments are: (i) products and cloud services (as part of its BMS offering); (ii) projects and
maintenance (as part of its BMS offering); and (iii) measurement (as part of its IMD offering) (accounting for
approximately 26%, 53% and 21% of Fidelix’s 2020 net sales, respectively, based on Fidelix’s management
accounts and before intragroup eliminations). Fidelix’s BMS and IMD services allow for close collaboration with
its customers throughout the life-cycle of their projects, whether through the development of solutions, assistance
during the design and engineering phases, installation of the Fidelix products (in Finland) or the management of
the building after the project’s completion.

_Products and cloud services_

Fidelix’s BMS offers hardware and software products to create systems that allow for reliable monitoring of
commercial buildings (including the monitoring of multiple systems and buildings through its centralized
monitoring solution). The BMS system collects data from various sensors (such as temperature, humidity and
carbon dioxide) and controls different processes in the building (such as ventilation, heating and cooling), using a
purpose-built computer that is usually located in the technical room of the building. Fidelix also offers more
advanced optimizations through cloud-based diagnostics and energy optimization solutions.

Products are sold either to Fidelix’s projects business (its largest single source of product sales) or through its
network of Finnish or Swedish system integrator partners, while its cloud services are offered directly to
end-customers that have a Fidelix BMS in place. Although Fidelix’s products and cloud services are offered in
both the Finnish and Swedish markets, its systems have been exported to other countries through Fidelix’s
system integrator partners.

_Projects and maintenance_

Through its project business offering, Fidelix offers a turn-key BMS service, which includes project
management, technical design services, sourcing of hardware and software and programming and installation
services. The project business serves as a route-to-market channel for Fidelix’s own BMS hardware and software


12


-----

products. Fidelix also offers an after-market services for its BMS, including on-site maintenance, system
improvement and development services, sales and installation of additional components and upgrades and longterm service contracts.

Fidelix’s turn-key BMS service is offered through participants in the new building construction markets that hire
Fidelix for the relevant project (such as building automation designers, project management consultants, general
contractors or HVAC contractors). Its aftermarket services, however, are offered directly to the building owners.
These project and maintenance services are offered in Finland.

_IMD_

Fidelix offers IMD solutions through its EcoGuard products and systems. These systems, which are typically
installed in the apartments and in the building’s technical rooms, collect and communicate data to CURVES, the
cloud-based IoT platform. The cloud software collects all the data for visualization, analysis, regulating energy
consumption and individual debiting. In addition to providing tools for individual metering and debiting to assist
residential building owners in managing their residential property portfolios, access to CURVES can be used to
reduce energy and water consumption and costs of tenant services and maintenance, as well for security purposes
(such as leak and smoke detections).

EcoGuard products and systems are offered in Sweden, with sales primarily made to customers in the residential
renovation sector, as well as to residential building owners that have Fidelix systems in place.

In 2019, Fidelix acquired a 40% stake in Lansen Sytems AB (“Lansen”), a Swedish manufacturer of wireless and
battery driven connected indoor climate and security sensors. This has enhanced its sub-metering and wireless
solution capabilities, as well as provided Fidelix with access to the smart-home market in Sweden and Finland.
Lansen products are expected to be sold through EcoGuard and Fidelix and to other European IMD specialists.

**_Overview of Fidelix Financial Performance_**

Fidelix has achieved solid financial performance in recent years. According to Fidelix’s management accounts,
for the year ended September 30, 2020, Fidelix had reported net sales, net profit, EBITDA and EBITDA margin
of €45.5 million, €2.3 million, €6.1 million and 13.4%, respectively. Growth in reported net sales since 2017
have been driven by both organic growth and acquisitions (including the acquisition of EcoGuard in April 2019).
Although a one-off provision in 2018 relating to an accounting methodology adjustment caused reported
EBITDA to decrease in 2018 (as compared to 2017), Fidelix’s successfully grew reported EBITDA in 2019 and
2020. Similarly, double-digit reported EBITDA margins have fluctuated between 2017 and 2020, with the
one-off provision in 2018 and investments in personnel in 2020 depressing strong margins.

Fidelix has demonstrated strong cash flow generative growth, with free cash flow and cash conversion of
€5.6 million and 91.1%, respectively, for the year ended September 30, 2020. Fidelix’s operational model does
not require significant capital expenditures, which amounted to €1.2 million for the year ended September 30,
2020 (according to Fidelix’s management accounts and excluding acquisition and financing related items
accounted for in capital expenditures). Although Fidelix’s capital expenditures have increased since 2017, the
majority of this increase relates to research and development projects, such as the development of a new
operating platform and EcoGuard’s development projects. Net working capital changes vary depending on the
working capital requirements of Fidelix’s BMS projects, which tend to tie up working capital given that a large
portion of the payment is received at the completion of the project. According to Fidelix’s management accounts,
Fidelix’s net working capital was €3.6 million as of September 30, 2020 (representing a negative net working
capital change of €0.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2020).

**_Rationale for Fidelix Acquisition_**

Fidelix’s business strengthens and complements our offering and accelerates our development journey.

The Fidelix Acquisition provides us with a market-leading position within the building automation market. This
fits directly in our strategy to organize according to technical disciplines with potential cross-sales synergies.
Moreover, the addition of a critical mass in BMS technical competence supports our long-term position. It also
provides a platform for further acquisition-led growth, especially given Fidelix’s track-record of successful
bolt-on acquisitions that have complemented its organic growth.


13


-----

We believe Fidelix will be accretive to us in light of the increased exposure to an attractive part of the resilient
installation market given Fidelix’s digitalization capabilities. In particular, we expect the Fidelix Acquisition will
provide a further platform for growth by increasing our exposure to a growing technical discipline, which
addresses certain key sustainability areas for businesses that we expect to be integrated in many future projects,
with a focus on areas such as energy efficiency, digitalization and health, and which is also backed by the
regulatory emphasis on increased sustainability. Fidelix will also add to our overall market presence in Finland,
enabling our overall Finnish operation to reach a critical mass.

Fidelix’s operations are also expected to enhance our overall margin profile by adding a relatively high-margin
business to the Group. Fidelix has a strong track record of double-digit margins. Its large and growing installed
base, which includes an installed base of approximately 11,000 in residential buildings in Sweden through
Fidelix’s EcoGuard products, further profitability through its aftermarket and cloud businesses, including through
CURVES, the cloud-based IoT platform. We believe that Fidelix’s recent positive financial performance can
continue in the near-term, particularly given its strong market position and focus on renovation projects. Fidelix’s
solid free cash flow conversion driven by relatively low capital expenditure requirements and focus on net
working capital efficiency is also consistent with the Group’s operations. Fidelix also offers a diversified
customer base, with exposure to different project sizes, including renovation and public sector projects. This
diversification is expected to increase further over time given Fidelix’s IMD services.

The Fidelix Acquisition also brings additional digitalization capabilities across the Group, which we expect to be
a driver as we focus on the next-generation of installation across all of our business areas. We also believe that
there is a strong cultural fit with Fidelix’s management given their focus on technical competence and similar
decentralized philosophy. For example, Fidelix’s in-house research and development team has developed and
introduced multiple successful technologies over the years. Likewise, our lean and tested support functions will
allow Fidelix to improve in terms of reporting and internal control in a more rapid and cost efficient manner.

**Recent Developments**

**_Bolt-on Acquisitions_**

Since October 1, 2020, we have completed the acquisitions of an additional thirteen companies in Sweden,
Norway and Finland and across each of our business areas, including four in Electrical, four in Heating and
Sanitation, three in Finland and one in each of Norway and Ventilation. These companies have a total of over 270
employees and estimated aggregated annual revenue of over SEK 450 million. These acquisitions were made
through share and asset purchases for an aggregate cash consideration of approximately SEK 310 million, of
which SEK 300 million has been paid as of the date hereof and SEK 10 million will be payable at a later date
under the terms of the relevant acquisition agreements. Furthermore, up to SEK 80 million of additional variable
cash consideration in respect of these acquisitions is payable over the next three years. See “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Results_
_of Operations—Acquisitions.”_

**_Trading Update_**

Based on preliminary results from our unaudited management accounts for the year ended December 31, 2020,
and other information currently available, we estimate that our net revenue will remain stable, as compared to net
revenue of SEK 9,978 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Estimated net revenue growth from
acquisitions was offset by negative organic growth, which was primarily attributable to the closure of a number
of unprofitable units in late 2019, in combination with enhanced production in several major projects during that
time. Despite stable estimated net revenue, we estimate that Adjusted EBITA will increase, as compared to
Adjusted EBITA of SEK 516 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and for Adjusted EBITA Margin to
improve as compared to the Adjusted EBITA Margin of 5.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019, driven by
measures to enhance profitability that were taken in late 2019 through our accelerated profitability program, in
combination with profitable acquisitions.

The above information relating to our current performance is derived from our internal management accounts.
Our management accounts are produced by financial reporting systems that we use as the basis of preparation for
our annual results at the end of each fiscal year. This information has been prepared by management. It has

The Temporary Notes will not be guaranteed. On the Issue Date, the obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Temporary Notes will be
secured by a first-priority pledge over the Escrow Account Charge.

The obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Original Notes are, and upon the Temporary Notes Exchange, the obligations of the Issuer
pursuant to the Additional Notes will be, guaranteed, jointly and severally on a senior basis, by each subsidiary of the Issuer that is a
guarantor under the Revolving Credit Facility. See footnote (8) below. The Original Notes are, and upon the Temporary Notes Exchange,
the Additional Notes will be, secured by a first-priority security interest in the same assets that secure the Issuer’s and Guarantors’
obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, subject to certain agreed security principles and agreed exceptions. See footnote
(5) below and “The Offering—Guarantees” and “The Offering—Security.”
(5) The Issuer entered into the Super Senior Facilities Agreement on December 2, 2019, which provides for an initial SEK 450 million
Revolving Credit Facility. The Issuer expects to increase the size of the Revolving Credit Facility by SEK 190 million on the Completion
Date through the provision of an additional revolving facility and additional facility commitments thereunder, subject to the satisfaction
of certain conditions.

The Issuer is the initial borrower of the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed on a senior basis by the
same guarantors and is secured on a first-priority basis over the same Collateral securing the Notes and certain hedging obligations. See
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—The Super Senior Facilities.”
(6) The Revolving Credit Facility is part of the Super Senior Facilities which also include an initial SEK 200 million Guarantee Facility and
an initial SEK 240 million Pension Guarantee Facility. In accordance with the requirements of the pension administrator, we have been
required to increase the amount of our bank guarantee in respect of the Group’s defined benefit pensions obligations by SEK 45 million.
Further to a consent and amendment request granted in December 2020, such increase was initially incurred under the Guarantee
Facility’s existing capacity. We expect to ultimately incur the additional SEK 45 million under the Pension Guarantee Facility once we
have increased the commitments under the Pension Guarantee Facility by a corresponding amount, as permitted to be increased under the
terms of the Pension Guarantee Facility Agreement (and to cancel the amount initially incurred under the Guarantee Facility). See
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—The Super Senior Facilities—Overview and structure.”

The Holders of the Original Notes and the Additional Notes will receive proceeds from enforcement of the Collateral and certain
distressed disposals only after any obligations under all obligations under the Super Senior Facilities, including obligations under the
Revolving Credit Facility, the Guarantee Facility and the Pension Guarantee Facility, as well as certain Hedging Obligations (if any),
have been repaid in full. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—The Super Senior Facilities.”
(7) On or about the Completion Date, part of the proceeds from the Offering will be downstreamed to Assemblin AB in order to pay the cash
consideration in connection with the Fidelix Acquisition. See “Use of Proceeds.”
(8) The obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Original Notes are, and upon the Temporary Notes Exchange, the obligations of the Issuer
pursuant to the Additional Notes will be, guaranteed, jointly and severally on a senior basis, by each subsidiary of the Issuer that is a
guarantor under the Revolving Credit Facility, including Assemblin Holding AB, Assemblin AB, Assemblin Sweden AB, Assemblin
Holding AS, Assemblin El AB, Assemblin VS AB, Assemblin Ventilation AB, Assemblin Installation AB and Assemblin AS. As of and
for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, the Guarantors represented 90% of our net revenues, 88% of our EBITDA and over
100% of our assets (other than goodwill and shares in subsidiaries), in each case, calculated on a stand-alone basis without giving effect
to intergroup eliminations.
(9) Within 60 business days following the Completion Date, the Original Notes and the Additional Notes will be secured by the issued
Capital Stock of Fidelix, subject to certain agreed security principles and agreed exceptions.

-----

AB, Assemblin VS AB, Assemblin Ventilation AB, Assemblin
Installation AB and Assemblin AS (together, the “Guarantors”). Each
of the Guarantors is also a guarantor under the Super Senior Facilities
(which includes the Pension Guarantee Facility and the Guarantee
Facility) and the Original Notes. The validity and enforceability of the
Notes Guarantees are subject to significant limitations as described in
“Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity
_and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security_
_Interests.”_

As of and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, the
Guarantors represented 90% of our net revenues, 88% of our
EBITDA and over 100% of our assets (other than goodwill and shares
in subsidiaries), in each case, calculated on a stand-alone basis
without giving effect to intergroup eliminations. On an as adjusted
basis after giving effect to the Transactions as of September 30, 2020,
the subsidiaries of the Issuer that will not guarantee the Original
Notes and the Additional Notes would have had less than SEK
10 million outstanding financial indebtedness.

Certain financial data with respect to our Guarantors has been derived
from accounting statements for the Guarantors, which are prepared in
accordance with the Swedish accounting standards, and not IFRS,
which is the basis of preparation for our financial statements. See
“Presentation of Financial and Other Data—Financial data for the
_Guarantors.”_

includes the Pension Guarantee Facility and the Guarantee
Facility), the Original Notes and certain hedging obligations;

will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral and
certain distressed disposals only after any obligations secured on a
super-priority basis, including obligations under the Super Senior
Facilities and certain hedging obligations, have been repaid in full;

Š rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Guarantor’s
existing and future senior indebtedness that is not subordinated in
right of payment to its Notes Guarantee, including any
indebtedness under the Super Senior Facilities and the Original
Notes;

Š rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future
subordinated indebtedness of the respective Guarantor;

Š be structurally subordinated to all existing and future obligations
of such Guarantor’s subsidiaries that are not also Guarantors;

Š be effectively senior to any existing and future indebtedness of
each Guarantor that is not secured by the Collateral owned by such
Guarantor, to the extent of the value of such Collateral; and

Š be effectively subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness
of each Guarantor that is secured by property or assets that do not
secure the Notes Guarantees on an equal basis, to the extent of the
value of the property or assets securing such indebtedness.

The Notes Guarantees will be subject to release under certain
circumstances. See “Description of the Notes—Guarantees.”

**Security . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** On the Issue Date, the Temporary Notes will be secured by a firstpriority security interest consisting of a pledge by the Issuer over the
Escrow Account (the “Escrow Account Charge”).

The Original Notes are, and upon the Temporary Notes Exchange, the
Additional Notes will be, secured by the following first-priority
security interests, subject to certain agreed security principles and
agreed exceptions:

Š the issued Capital Stock of the Issuer;

Š the issued Capital Stock of the Initial Guarantors;

Š certain long-term material intra-Group loans (in respect of which
the Issuer or an Initial Guarantor is a creditor), with a final
maturity date or intended tenor in excess of twelve months and
with a principal amount in excess of €10 million (or its equivalent
in other currencies) in aggregate to a member of the Group as
debtor (if any);

Š existing and future shareholder loans owed by the Issuer to the
Parent, any Shareholder Creditor (as defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement) or any Sponsor Affiliate (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement) (if any), provided, however, that in
respect of the pledge agreement entered into on or before the
Original Issue Date in respect of future shareholder loans, only the
Parent entered into such pledge agreement and each Shareholder
Creditor and/or Sponsor Affiliate shall only enter into such pledge
agreement prior to granting any shareholder loans to the Issuer;

Š the Issuer’s and the Initial Guarantors’ material operating bank
accounts (but excluding any escrow, cash collateral, blocked and
pooling accounts, accounts in connection with any receivables
financing (including discounting or factoring or similar), any
guarantee or letter of credit financing, or similar) (if any); and

Š certain business mortgages (not resulting in stamp duties or
similar) in the Initial Guarantors,

(together, the “Completion Date Collateral”).

Within 60 business days of the Completion Date, the Additional
Notes will be secured by the issued Capital Stock of Fidelix, subject
to certain agreed security principles and agreed exceptions (the “PostCompletion Date Collateral” and, together with the Completion Date
Collateral, the “Collateral”).

The liens and security interests securing the Additional Notes may be
released under certain circumstances. See “Description of the Notes—
_Security.”_

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special**
**Mandatory Redemption . . . . . . . . . .** Pending the consummation of the Fidelix Acquisition, the Initial
Purchasers will, concurrently with the issuance of the Temporary
Notes on the Issue Date, deposit with the Escrow Agent an amount
equal to the gross proceeds of the Offering sold on the Issue Date into
the Escrow Account. The Escrow Account will be controlled by the
Escrow Agent. The Escrow Account, together with the Escrowed


21


-----

Property, will be pledged on a first-priority basis in favor of the
Temporary Trustee or the Security Agent for the benefit of the
holders of the Temporary Notes, pursuant to the Escrow Account
Charge. Upon delivery to the Temporary Trustee and the Escrow
Agent of an officer’s certificate stating that the conditions to the
release of the proceeds from escrow are satisfied, the escrowed funds
will be released to the Issuer and utilized as described in “The
_Transactions,” “Use of Proceeds” and “Description of the Temporary_
_Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”_

In the event that (a) the Release does not take place on or prior to the
Escrow Longstop Date, (b) in the reasonable judgment of the Issuer,
the Fidelix Acquisition will not be consummated on or prior the
Escrow Longstop Date or the Issuer or one of its subsidiaries has
announced its intention to abandon the Fidelix Acquisition, (c) the
Fidelix Acquisition Agreement terminates at any time prior to the
Escrow Longstop Date or (d) there is an Event of Default resulting
from certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protections of
the Issuer (the date of any such event being the “Special Termination
Date”), the Issuer will redeem all of the Temporary Notes (the
“Special Mandatory Redemption”) at a price (the “Special Mandatory
Redemption Price”) equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price of the
Temporary Notes, plus accrued but unpaid interest, if any, from the
Issue Date to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date
(subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date). See
“Description of the Temporary Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special
_Mandatory Redemption” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the_
_Fidelix Acquisition—If the conditions to the release of the proceeds of_
_the Offering set forth in the Escrow Agreement are not satisfied, the_
_Temporary Notes will be redeemed and you may not get the return_
_you expect on the Temporary Notes.”_

**Intercreditor Agreement . . . . . . . . . . . .** Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the first-priority security
interests securing the Additional Notes upon the Temporary Notes
Exchange will contractually deemed to rank equally with the security
interests that secure (but only to the extent that such security is
expressed to secure those liabilities) (i) obligations under the Super
Senior Facilities (which includes the Pension Guarantee Facility and
the Guarantee Facility), (ii) certain obligations under hedging
arrangements and (iii) certain other future indebtedness and
obligations permitted to be incurred under the Indenture. Such
security interests are, or will be, evidenced by security documents for
the benefit of (whether directly or through the Security Agent) the
holders of the Additional Notes, the lenders under the Super Senior
Facilities and/or the holders of certain other future indebtedness or
obligations permitted to be incurred under the Indenture. Under the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, subject to certain conditions, in
the event of acceleration of the Super Senior Facilities or the
Additional Notes, amounts recovered in respect of the Additional
Notes, including from the enforcement of the Collateral, will be
required to repay indebtedness in respect of the Super Senior
Facilities, certain future indebtedness and obligations permitted under
the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement to rank
_pari passu with the Super Senior Facilities and future hedging_
obligations (if any) in priority to the Additional Notes, following the
payment of fees and expenses of the agent under the Super Senior
Facilities, the Trustee and the Security Agent (and any receiver or


22


-----

delegate) and any fees and expenses of any other creditor
representative of future indebtedness permitted under the terms of the
Indenture to benefit from such security interests.

The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the relevant security
unless instructed by the relevant Instructing Group (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement). The relevant Instructing Group or such
other class of creditors as specified by the Intercreditor Agreement
may, under certain conditions, be entitled to instruct the Security
Agent to enforce the relevant security subject to, and in accordance
with, the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. In the event of
conflicting instructions, the Intercreditor Agreement contains
provisions as to which set of instructions will prevail. See
“Description _of_ _Certain_ _Financing_ _Arrangements—Intercreditor_
_Agreement.”_

**Additional Amounts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Any payments made by the Issuer or any Guarantor with respect to
the Notes or the Notes Guarantees will be made without withholding
or deduction for or on account of taxes unless required by law. If the
Issuer or the Guarantors are required by law to withhold or deduct
amounts for or on account of tax imposed by a relevant taxing
jurisdiction with respect to a payment to the holders of Notes, the
Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will, subject to certain exceptions,
pay the additional amounts necessary so that the net amount received
by the holders of the Notes after the withholding or deduction is not
less than the amount that they would have received in the absence of
the withholding or deduction. See “Description of the Notes—
_Withholding Taxes.”_

**Use of Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** On or about the Completion Date, we expect to use the gross proceeds
of the Offering, together with the proceeds from the Sponsor
Investment, to (a) finance the cash consideration payable to the
Sellers in connection with the Fidelix Acquisition (including the
purchase price, certain other purchase price adjustments under the
Fidelix Acquisition Agreement and the repayment of certain debt of
the Target), (b) pay transaction costs associated with the Transactions
and (c) fund cash on balance sheet, including potential acquisitions.
See “Use of Proceeds.”

**Optional Redemption . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Issuer will be entitled at its option to redeem all or a portion of
the Notes at the applicable redemption prices set forth under the
heading “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption,” plus
accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.

**Optional Redemption for Tax**
**Reasons . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** In the event of certain developments affecting taxation which cause
the Issuer to pay additional amounts, the Issuer may redeem the
relevant Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time, at a redemption
price of 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the
date of redemption. See “Description of the Notes—Redemption for
_Taxation Reasons.”_

**Change of Control . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Upon the occurrence of certain events defined as constituting a
change of control, the Issuer may be required to offer to repurchase
all outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the
principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date
of purchase.

**SUMMARY COMBINED FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

The following summary combined financial information of Group as of and for the years ended December 31,
2019, 2018, and 2017 have been derived from the Audited Combined Financial Statements included elsewhere in
this offering memorandum.

The following summary condensed financial information of the Group as of and for the nine months ended
September 30, 2020 and 2019, have been derived from the Unaudited Condensed Interim Financial Statements
included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

The Financial Statements have been prepared as combined financial statements. The combined financial
information has been prepared as combined financial statements in a way of illustrating financial information for
a group of entities that are not a legal group but are ultimately owned by the same party. The combined financial
information represents the group of entities that became the legal Assemblin Financing Group at the end of 2019.

From January 1, 2019, we apply IFRS 16 Leases which has an impact on our reported statements of profit or loss,
financial position and presentation of cash flow. In implementing IFRS 16, we selected the modified
retrospective approach as the transition method As a result, the Unaudited Condensed Interim Financial
Statements and the 2019 financial information contained in the Audited Combined Financial Statements are
prepared after implementing IFRS 16, and the 2018 and 2017 financial information contained in the Audited
Combined Financial Statements is prepared prior to the implementation of IFRS 16. The comparison figures for
2018 and earlier periods have not been restated, and are thus not directly comparable where there are differences
caused by the implementation of IFRS 16. See Note 1 to the Audited Combined Financial Statements.

The unaudited condensed statement of comprehensive income information and the other financial information
presented for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 have been derived by subtracting from the financial
information of the audited combined financial statements as of December 31, 2019 the comparative financial
information of the unaudited condensed interim financial statements for the nine months ended September 30,
2019, and adding the financial information of the unaudited condensed interim financial statements for the nine
months ended September 30, 2020.

The unaudited condensed statement of comprehensive income information and the other financial information
presented for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 have been prepared for illustrative purposes only and
are not necessarily representative of our results of operations for any future period or our financial condition at
any future date. In particular, the unaudited financial information for the twelve-month period ended
September 30, 2020 is not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ended
December 31, 2020 and should not be used as the basis for or prediction of an annualized calculation. This data
has been prepared solely for the purpose of this offering memorandum, is not prepared in the ordinary course of
our financial reporting.

The unaudited as adjusted and pro forma combined financial information presented in this section has been
prepared to illustrate the effect of the Transactions and certain other adjustments on certain combined financial
information as of and for the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2020. The information, which has been
produced for illustrative purposes only, by its nature addresses a hypothetical situation and, therefore, does not
represent the Group’s actual financial position or results, nor do they purport to project our financial position at
any future date or our results of operations for any future period. The actual results may differ significantly from
those reflected in the as adjusted and pro forma combined financial information for a number of reasons,
including, but not limited to, differences in assumptions used to prepare the as adjusted and pro forma combined
financial information.

The Group’s combined financial information and other data should be read in conjunction with the information
contained in “Use _of_ _Proceeds,”_ “Capitalization,” “Selected _Consolidated_ _and_ _Combined_ _Financial_
_Information,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and_
the Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

Notes:
(1) The unaudited financial data for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 has been derived by subtracting the combined financial
information for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 from the combined financial information for the year ended December 31,
2019 and adding the combined financial information for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and, where indicated, excluding the
impact of IFRS 16. The financial information for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 has been prepared for illustrative
purposes only and is not necessarily representative of our results of operations, cash flows or financial position for any future period at
any future date, is not prepared in the ordinary course of our financial reporting.
(2) Excludes the impact of IFRS 16 on the combined financial information as of and for the relevant period.
(3) EBITA, Adjusted EBITA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and other ratios derived therefrom are non-IFRS
measures. We define EBITA as profit for the year/period before tax, net financial items and amortization of intangible assets. We define
Adjusted EBITA as EBITA before items affecting comparability (including impairment of rights-of-use assets), which are categorized as
acquisition, integration and start-up costs, restructuring costs, transformation costs and other items affecting comparability, as described
under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of
_Operations—Items Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations.” We define Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITA before_
depreciation of property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets, and after certain lease accounting adjustments to exclude the
impact of IFRS 16 on the combined financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 and the nine months ended
September 30, 2019 and 2020. We define Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted to reflect the pro forma
EBITDA contribution of the Fidelix Acquisition, certain other acquisitions that were not consolidated for the full twelve months ended
September 30, 2020 and operational cost savings initiatives that were completed by December 31, 2019. Investors should not consider

-----

EBITA, Adjusted EBITA, Adjusted EBITDA or Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (a) as an alternative to operating profit/(loss) as a
measure of our operating performance, (b) as an alternative to cashflow from operating and investment activities as a measure of our
ability to meet cash needs or (c) as an alternative to any other measure of performance under IFRS. EBITA, Adjusted EBITA, Adjusted
EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as presented in this offering memorandum may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures reported by other companies due to differences in the way these measures are calculated. See “Presentation of Financial and
_Other Information—Presentation of Financial Information—Non-IFRS Measures.” Investors should also note that EBITA, Adjusted_
EBITA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as presented above are calculated differently from “Consolidated
EBITDA” as defined and used in the Indenture. See “Description of Notes—Certain Definitions” for a definition of “Consolidated
EBITDA” in the Indenture. The following is a reconciliation of profit to EBITA, Adjusted EBITA, Adjusted EBITDA and to Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented:

Notes:
(i) Derived from Fidelix’s management accounts.

(ii) Reflects Fidelix revenue/EBITDA items which were non-recurring and/or unrelated to Fidelix’s operating performance (such
as, for example the EBITDA impact to the reversal of a provision), as well as pro forma items relating to historical acquisitions
by Fidelix.

(iii) Represents the pro forma effect of the EBITDA of Säätölaitehuolto, which Fidelix agreed to acquire in October 2020. The pro
forma adjustment is based on management information of Säätölaitehuolto for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020,
as adjusted by Fidelix management for losses of a discontinued business.
(g) Reflects management’s estimate of (i) the pro forma full twelve-month impact of certain acquisitions that were completed prior to
September 30, 2020 and (ii) the pro forma EBITDA contribution of certain acquisitions that were completed after September 30,
2020, in each case, as if such acquisitions had completed on October 1, 2019. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Acquisitions.” The adjustments_
are based on each target’s historical EBITDA derived from its management accounts, as adjusted for its actual contribution to our
results of operations since the date of its acquisition and as further adjusted in a manner consistent with our Adjusted EBITDA to
the extent applicable and the application of our accounting policies and other items.
(h) Reflects management’s estimate of the pro forma run-rate effect for the three months ended December 31, 2019 of certain
operational cost savings initiatives that were implemented during, and completed by the end of, 2019, as if such operational cost
savings initiatives had been completed by October 1, 2019. To deliver these cost savings, we incurred costs of approximately
SEK 148 million during the last quarter of 2019 that have been categorized as restructuring costs (see footnote (b) above).
(i) The pro forma adjustments to Adjusted EBITDA presented above are for informational purposes only and do not purport to present
what our results of operations would have been, nor do they purport to project our results of operations for any future period.
Moreover, the assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments to Adjusted EBITDA presented above are based on our current
estimates, and they involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or
achievements to be materially different from any anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by
such pro forma financial information. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Anticipated pro forma adjustments to our
_financial information may not materialize as anticipated.”_

(4) We define Adjusted EBITA Margin as Adjusted EBITA divided by net revenue for the period and Adjusted EBITDA Margin as
Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenue for the period, expressed as a percentage.

and the use of proceeds therefrom, as if they had occurred on September 30, 2020 with respect to our combined statement of financial
position data and October 1, 2019 with respect to data derived from our combined statement of earnings and other comprehensive
income. The unaudited adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable under
the circumstances. The unaudited as adjusted financial information is presented for informational purposes only. The unaudited as
adjusted financial information does not purport to represent what our results of operations or financial position would have been had the
Transactions, including the Offering and the use of proceeds therefrom, actually occurred at the beginning of the period or on the date
indicated, and such information does not purport to project the results of operations or financial position for any future period or as of
any future date. The unaudited as adjusted financial information should be read in conjunction with the information contained in
“Selected Historical Financial Information,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations” and the combined financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this offering memorandum. The_
unaudited as adjusted financial information is not intended to represent pro forma financial information prepared in accordance with the
requirements of Regulation S-X promulgated under the U.S. Securities Act or other SEC requirements or IFRS.
(11) As adjusted cash and cash equivalents represent total cash and cash equivalents of SEK 507 million as of September 30, 2020, adjusted

(12) As adjusted total net debt as of September 30, 2020 gives effect to the Transactions, including the Offering and the use of proceeds
therefrom, as if they had occurred on September 30, 2020. As adjusted total net debt includes the principal amount of the Notes, lease
liabilities (SEK 322 million, which has been adjusted to exclude the impact from the adoption of IFRS 16, which resulted in a decrease in
lease liabilities of SEK 431 million) and other long-term debt, less as adjusted cash and cash equivalents. In addition, we expect to have
SEK 640 million of undrawn commitments available under the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalization.”
(13) As adjusted interest expense represents interest payable on total debt (excluding the effects of the adoption of IFRS 16 on leases) for the
twelve months ended September 30, 2020, adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, including the Offering and the use of proceeds
therefrom, which comprises (i) the principal amount of the Notes, (ii) lease liabilities of SEK 322 million (which has been adjusted to
exclude the impact from the adoption of IFRS 16, resulting in a decrease in lease liabilities of SEK 431 million) and (iii) expenses and
commitment fees related to our Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facility (assuming no utilization thereunder). Interest expense related to
the Temporary Notes has been calculated on the basis of 0% EURIBOR and based on a Bloomberg exchange rate of €1.00 to
SEK 10.4933 as of September 30, 2020. Any hedging we may undertake in respect of our obligations has not been reflected.

**RISK FACTORS**

_In addition to the other information contained in this offering memorandum, you should carefully consider the_
_following risk factors before purchasing the Temporary Notes. The risks and uncertainties we describe below are_
_not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are not aware or that we currently_
_believe are immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If_
_any of the possible events described below were to occur, our business, financial condition and results of_
_operations could be materially and adversely affected. If that happens, we may not be able to pay interest or_
_principal on the Temporary Notes or the Additional Notes when due, respectively, and you could lose all or part_
_of your investment. This offering memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and_
_uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking_
_statements as a result of various factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this offering_
_memorandum._

**Risks Related to Our Business and Industry**

**Our business may be adversely affected by difficult economic conditions and other factors beyond our**
**control**

Our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the Nordic, European and global economies.
The demand for some of our services tends to be cyclical and can be significantly lower in an economic
environment characterized by lower household income and corporate earnings, lower levels of government and
business spending and slowdowns in the construction industry. Demand for our services depends in particular on
spending in residential and commercial construction in the Nordic region as well as renovation and maintenance
in industrial and infrastructure markets in that region, and a prolonged period of slow growth or economic
contraction may reduce demand for our services. The level of activity in these end-markets depends on a variety
of factors that we cannot control, including:

Š local, regional and global economic conditions, slowdowns and recessions;

Š the policies of the countries in which we operate, including the policies of the central banks of Sweden,
Norway and Finland;

Š the policies of transnational institutions, such as the European Central Bank and other institutions of the
European Union, which influence the performance of national economies in countries in which we operate;
and

Š the level of demand in construction and in manufacturing and process industries, demographic trends,
capital spending and consumer confidence.

Unfavorable developments with respect to any or all of these or other factors can have a material impact on the
demand for the services that we offer, both in terms of decreased volumes and price levels.

One of our market drivers is activity in the new construction market, which is sensitive to general business and
economic conditions both regionally and worldwide, including the availability of credit, interest rates, inflation,
fluctuations in capital, the credit and mortgage markets, changes in tax laws affecting the real estate industry,
unemployment levels, and business and consumer confidence. The demand for some of our services is cyclical to
the construction market.

We provide the majority of our services to the renovation and maintenance and related services markets, which
have historically been more resilient to macroeconomic changes and can tend to be countercyclical. Private
residential spend, as well as other sectors of the installation market, can be affected by high mortgage
delinquency and foreclosure rates and limitations in the availability of home improvement financing, which may
limit consumers’ spending during economic downturns, particularly on discretionary items, and affect their
confidence level, leading to continued reduced spending on home improvement projects. The impact of these
economic factors specific to the renovation and maintenance market may be further exacerbated by
unemployment levels.

As a result, adverse developments in global financial markets and general business and economic conditions,
including economic recessions, downturns or negative developments or general weakness in the economies of the
Nordic countries could adversely affect demand for our products and services, which would have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

36


-----

In particular, the outlook for the world economy remains subject to uncertainty, particularly in light of the impact
of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may lead to prolonged periods of economic uncertainty in the Nordic,
European and global economies. The International Monetary Fund predicts negative global growth in 2020 and
many national governments have instituted rescue policies intended to prevent a financial recession. A renewed
or future recession could reduce the demand for our services, particularly due to any reduced spending in
residential and commercial construction in the Nordic region as well as renovation and maintenance in industrial
and infrastructure markets in that region. Moreover, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or other similar
pandemics or adverse public health developments, our operations and those of our customers, subcontractors and
suppliers, may experience delays, disruptions and other adverse effects, such as suspension or reduction of
operations, declines in sales activities, difficulties in travel and communications, and regulatory restrictions, any
of which could have a material adverse impact on us as a result of, for example, a further reduction in demand for
our services, delays and uncertainties in project timelines, deteriorations in the ability of our customers and
subcontractors to serve their contractual obligations due to liquidity constraints or other financial difficulties.
Although schemes have been initiated by national governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate to
provide financial support to parts of the economy most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the actual impact
on our customers, subcontractors and suppliers and, therefore, the impact on us, remain uncertain at this stage.
See “—A change in supplier rebates due to the loss of our leading market position or other market conditions or
_a deterioration in our commercial relationship with one or more key suppliers could adversely affect our income_
_and gross margins” and “—Our operations could be adversely affected if a significant number of our customers_
_terminate their services contracts prior to the end of the contractual term or select another provider following_
_the expiration of their contracts.” Moreover, although governmental authorities in most of the countries in which_
we operate have loosened restrictions as compared to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, many restrictions
have remained in place and a significant number of these governmental authorities have re-imposed restrictions
(or may impose new restrictions) in response to an increasing number of COVID-19 cases. It is not possible to
predict the end of the pandemic or how long the restrictions may remain in place as a precaution even once the
pandemic has ended. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations or on our ability to service or otherwise make payments on the Notes and our
other indebtedness. Furthermore, in our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have utilized certain generallyavailable governmental support measures in conjunction with the temporary suspension or part time work of a
portion of our employees. Although the amounts received to date have not been significant, should we require
additional significant support, any government action relating to funds received by the Group under such
governmental support measures, including demands for repayment, could have a material adverse effect on the
financial condition and results of operations of the Group.

**We may not be able to successfully manage future growth**

Our ability to manage our growth and integrate operations, technologies, services and personnel depends on our
administrative, financial and operational controls and our ability to create the infrastructure necessary to exploit
market opportunities for our services, as well as our financial resources. In order to compete effectively and to
grow our business profitably, we will need, on a timely basis, to maintain and improve our financial and
management controls, reporting systems and procedures, implement new systems as necessary, attract and retain
adequate management personnel, and hire, retain and train a highly qualified workforce. Furthermore, we expect
that as we continue to introduce new services and enter new markets, we will be required to manage an
increasing number of relationships with various customers and other third parties. This would typically require us
to attract, train and retain increasing numbers of highly skilled technical personnel and branch managers. The
failure or delay of our management in responding to these challenges could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and result of operations.

**We operate in highly competitive markets**

The market for installation and services is highly competitive. There are currently a large number of small, local
companies and a smaller number of relatively large regional, national and multinational companies operating in
our markets. We also expect that new competitors may develop over time as smaller enterprises become more
established and reliable and refine their service capabilities.

Competition varies depending on business area, customer classification and geographic area. The principal
competitive factors in our business include the following:

Š the availability and cost of materials and supplies;

Š technical product knowledge and expertise as to application and usage;

37


-----

Š consulting and other service capabilities;

Š the ability to build and maintain customer relationships;

Š the effective use of technology to identify net revenue and operational opportunities;

Š same-day delivery capabilities for certain services; and

Š the pricing of services and the provision of credit.

Some of our current or future competitors may have greater resources or lower price discipline than we do, and
may use this advantage to further increase their market share. Competitors may also engage in aggressive pricing
tactics, which may lead to us having to reduce our prices in order to compete with them. For example, since the
start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been subject to increased competition on smaller projects due to
increased price competition from local companies. Furthermore, we may expend significant time and resources in
order to prepare a bid or participate in a bidding process, at the end of which we may not be retained. Even if we
are awarded a contract, it may not yield the expected results. As a result of high competition, therefore, we may
not be able to maintain our competitive position in the markets in which we operate and our net revenue,
profitability and market shares may decline, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations and financial condition.

In addition, the nature of the markets in which we compete may attract new entrants, particularly from countries
with low-cost employment. Although we consider this risk to be relatively limited, in part, due to significant
levels of unionization and professional qualification requirements for workforce engaged in the installation and
services industry, competition with service providers that benefit from lower cost structures may challenge our
competitive position. Furthermore, in recent years, new construction methods have led to the introduction of a
range of new low-cost installation solutions. For example, as low-cost prefabricated housing construction
becomes more common, the demand for prefabricated building and housing components with pre-built low-cost
installations may increase, which may have an adverse impact on the demand for our services. If we are unable to
respond to these shifts in demand, our sales may decline, which could have an adverse effect on our financial
condition and results of operations.

**The Nordic Building Services Market has low barriers to entry at the local branch level and we may face a**
**loss of market share or a decrease in margins from increased price competition in certain local markets**

The market for installation and services is highly fragmented, with low barriers to entry at the local level. Our
local branches compete with a large number of relatively small local installers and service providers, some of
whom benefit from operating efficiencies or lower overhead costs than us, which enables them to offer lower
prices than we do. This has in the past and may continue to result in a high degree of competition at the local or
regional level in the Nordic Building Services Market. Increased industry competition could result in increased
price competition, lower profit margins, a decline in our market share and greater competition for qualified
personnel. If we were to face such competition, our net revenue, profitability and market shares may decline,
which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**Our competitors continue to consolidate, which could cause the markets in which we operate to become**
**more competitive and could negatively impact our business**

There has been an increase in consolidation activity among our competitors in the markets in which we operate.
This consolidation is being driven primarily by customer need and supplier capabilities, which could cause our
markets to become more competitive as greater economies of scale are achieved by our competitors. Customers
are increasingly aware of the total costs of not having access to consistent sources of supply at multiple locations.
While we believe these customer needs could result in fewer numbers of competitors in the market as our
remaining competitors become larger and capable of supplying their services on a more consistent and
comprehensive basis, these consolidated competitors may increase competition along the value chain.

We may fail to effectively participate in the industry consolidation for a variety of reasons, including antitrust
restrictions, which may limit the degree to which a large market participant such as us can acquire additional
competitors, as well as our substantial indebtedness, and we may not have the resources to compete for such
acquisitions. In addition, industry consolidation could make it more difficult for us to maintain operating margins
and could also increase competition for our acquisition targets and result in higher purchase price multiples. We
may also face increased difficulty in growing and maintaining our market share and increasing our growth
prospects.

**Our growth strategy involves acquisitions, and we may experience difficulties identifying acquisition**
**targets, integrating acquired businesses and achieving anticipated synergies**

Growth through acquisitions is one of our key growth strategies. We regularly identify and evaluate acquisition
opportunities. For example, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we have acquired businesses in
Sweden across several business areas, including one in Electrical, three in Heating and Sanitation and three in
Ventilation. Since October 1, 2020, we have completed the acquisitions of an additional thirteen companies in
Sweden, Norway and Finland and across each of our business areas, including four in Electrical, four in Heating
and Sanitation, three in Finland and one in each of Norway and Ventilation. See “Management’s Discussion and
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—_
_Acquisitions.” We also expect to complete the Fidelix Acquisition with part of the proceeds from the Offering._
See “Summary—The Transactions—The Fidelix Acquisition.” We may enter into binding agreements to acquire
additional businesses that we expect to complement or augment our existing operations. There can be no
assurance, however, that suitable acquisition targets will be identified in the future, or that we will be able to
finance such acquisitions on favorable terms. Furthermore, acquisitions we have already made or future
acquisitions may not be integrated successfully into our operations and may not achieve desired financial
objectives. Any acquisitions of businesses entail numerous operational and financial risks, including:

Š higher than expected acquisition and integration costs;

Š the possibility that we could pay more than the acquired company or its assets are worth;

Š the possibility that we may not identify appropriate acquisition targets, complete future acquisitions on
satisfactory terms or realize expected synergies or cost savings within expected timelines;

Š unforeseen expenses, delays or conditions may be imposed upon the acquisition, including due to required
regulatory approvals or consents;

Š exposure to unknown liabilities;

Š difficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of acquired businesses with our existing
operations and personnel;

Š diversion of management’s attention from our day-to-day business;

Š impairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers of acquired businesses due to changes in
management and ownership and the restructuring of logistics and information technology systems;

Š the inability to retain key employees of acquired businesses;

Š difficulty avoiding labor disruptions in connection with any integration, particularly in connection with any
headcount reduction; and

Š the incurrence of substantial debt.

The occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
condition. See also, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Fidelix Acquisition.”

In addition, there can be no assurance that, following integration into our Group, an acquired operation will be
able to maintain its customer base consistent with expectations or generate the expected margins or cash flow.
Although we analyze each acquisition target, our assessments are subject to a number of assumptions concerning
profitability, growth, interest rates and company valuations. We may have difficulties in implementing our
business model within an acquired company due to various factors, including conflicting corporate culture. There
can be no assurance that our assessments of and assumptions regarding acquisition targets will prove to be
correct and actual developments may differ significantly from our expectations.

In agreeing to acquire entities, we generally make certain assumptions and determinations on, among other
things, future net revenue and earnings, based on our investigation of the respective businesses and other
information then available. We cannot assure you that our assumptions and determinations will prove to be
correct or that liabilities, contingencies or other risks previously not known to us will not arise. In addition, we
may be limited in our ability to acquire companies depending on the concentration of ownership in specific
markets and our relative market position. Any such unanticipated risks, liabilities, contingencies, losses or issues,
if realized, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Furthermore, acquisitions of companies expose us to the risk of unforeseen obligations with respect to
employees, customers, suppliers and subcontractors of acquired businesses, public authorities and other parties.
We cannot ensure that there will not be unexpected risks or obligations. Such obligations, were they to
materialize, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

39

**Anticipated pro forma adjustments to our financial information may not materialize as anticipated**

We present certain information herein on the basis of certain estimates and assumptions to present for the twelve
months ended September 31, 2020 management’s estimate of, among other things, (i) the pro forma full twelvemonth impact of the Fidelix Acquisition, as if such acquisition had completed on October 1, 2019 (based on
Fidelix’s historical EBITDA derived from its management accounts, as adjusted for certain non-recurring items
and the estimated pro forma effect of an acquisition by Fidelix and the application of consistent accounting
policies) and (ii) the pro forma full twelve-month impact of certain acquisitions that were completed prior to and
after September 30, 2020, in each case, as if such acquisitions had completed on October 1, 2019 (based on each
target’s historical EBITDA derived from its management accounts, as adjusted for its actual contribution to our
results of operations since the date of its acquisition and as further adjusted in a manner consistent with our
presentation of financial information to the extent applicable and the application of our accounting policies and
other items). See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—
_Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Acquisitions.”_

Each of the adjustments is based on our current estimates, and involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other
factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any anticipated
future results. None of the pro forma financial data and underlying assumptions has been audited, reviewed or
verified by an independent accounting firm or other third party. The adjustments and assumptions used in
preparing these metrics may prove to be inaccurate or may be affected by other factors that have not been
accounted for, including if any of the risks set out in these ‘‘Risk Factors’’ are magnified. As such, they should
not be considered in isolation or be used as a substitute for an analysis of the operating results of our Group and
no undue reliance should be made in respect of such information.

Any failure to realize the anticipated pro forma adjustments to financial information could materially and
adversely affect our business, result of operations and financial condition.

**Our success depends on effective project and site management, which could be impaired by a certain**
**number of factors**

For many of our projects, we provide a broad range of services with a high technical content. For example, in our
Assemblin EL segment, we install complex electrical infrastructure in hospitals and other commercial buildings
and in our service business area, we provide maintenance and periodic repair of these installations, for which a
high level of technical skill is required. In order to ensure that the projects we take on are effectively conducted
and profitable, we need to have a high degree of project and site management expertise, especially in evaluating
the costs of providing our services to the relevant customer and in maximizing efficiency in providing the
contracted services throughout the term of the contract. Specific factors that can affect our performance and
profitability include our ability to accurately determine the costs of providing the contracted services in the
context of a particular project, our ability to measure the personnel and other resources that we need to deploy in
order to fulfil our contractual obligations on an ongoing basis, our ability to control services provided by
subcontractors or to influence the performance of such subcontractors or other service providers, and unforeseen
technical difficulties that could cause project delays or unscheduled project downtime. The challenges related to
project management could be magnified by the growth of our business, as we may be unable to staff each project
with suitably qualified personnel. See “—Our success is highly dependent on the ability to recruit and retain
_technical and other key personnel.” Moreover, our ability to effectively manage our projects or deliver our_
services may be affected by factors beyond our control. For example, although these effects have not been
significant to our financial results, since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced delays in
several installation projects due to the closing of construction sites. Moreover, due to relatively more stringent
lockdown measures in the second quarter of 2020, we were unable to deliver our services to certain customers.
See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors
_Affecting Our Results of Operations—General Economic Conditions and Activity in the Installation Market.”_

If, due to ineffective contract planning or management or otherwise, we are unable to efficiently and profitably
render our services, we could experience increased contract execution costs, difficulty in obtaining timely
payment for our services or harm to our reputation, which could materially adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**We bear the risk of cost overruns in many of our projects and, as a result, we may experience reduced**
**profits or, in some cases, losses under these projects if the cost increases are above our estimated amounts**

We base our prices for our fixed-price contracts largely upon estimates and assumptions of projected costs. The
timetable of execution and/or cost structure of our projects can differ from bid estimates because both depend on

40


-----

a wide range of parameters, some of which are difficult to forecast at the beginning of a project, such as the
accessibility of the work site, the availability of qualified personnel, adverse weather conditions and increases in
the prices of petroleum or raw materials used in the materials we purchase for installation in our customers’ sites
(for example, copper with respect to cables) which we may not be able to pass on through re-invoicing to our
customers. If our estimates or assumptions prove to be inaccurate, circumstances change in a way that renders
our assumptions and estimates inaccurate, or if unexpected complexities in project execution arise, we may incur
costs higher than those that we estimated, cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits or a
loss for affected projects. For example, in the first quarter of 2019, we have experienced cost overruns on some
of our projects in Norway, which have negatively affected our Norway segment’s performance and margins
during that period.

We also are exposed to increases in energy prices and prices for raw materials that we may be unable to pass on
to our customers. Additionally, in certain circumstances, we guarantee project completion or the achievement of
certain acceptance and performance testing levels by a scheduled date, as well as provide warranties to our
customers for a certain period (generally five years) after project completion. Although we seek to procure
performance guarantees for our projects from insurance companies and banks for up to 10% of the project’s
value, a failure to meet schedule or performance requirements typically results in additional costs to us, and, in
some cases, it may create liability for consequential and liquidated damages. In certain circumstances, some
providers of performance guarantees may determine we are no longer qualified to receive such guarantees, in
which case, we would need to find alternative providers. Performance problems for existing and future projects
could cause our actual results of operations to differ materially from those we anticipate and could damage our
reputation within our industry and our customer base.

**Our success is highly dependent on the ability to recruit and retain technical and other key personnel**

Our future success depends on our ability to continue to identify, attract, train, retain and motivate a sufficient
number of highly skilled technical personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense. We may be unable to
successfully attract, assimilate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel. Failure to do so could harm our business
and growth, and ultimately our profitability. In particular, it may be difficult to find qualified personnel in
regions that are experiencing a growth in demand for the services that we provide, such as in Stockholm, Oslo
and Helsinki. In addition, our continued success depends largely on our ability to retain our technical and key
personnel. The departure of significant numbers of our highly skilled personnel could impair our ability to
execute our business plan and growth strategy, cause a loss of customers, reduce revenues and adversely affect
employee morale. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain or attract an adequately skilled labor
force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our business strategy or that labor expenses will not increase
as a result of a shortage in the supply of these skilled personnel.

In addition, our activities require a wide range of continually evolving skills in order to keep up with changes in
the sectors in which we operate. We may be unable to find qualified candidates, train staff in new methods, and
recruit and train managers.

We may also face decreased access to qualified labor due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related government
mandated lockdowns due to closure of borders and decreased labor mobility. For example, our operations in
Norway and Finland during the second quarter of 2020 were adversely affected by such restrictions due to the
impediments on our ability to use subcontractors from outside such countries. Moreover, due to the COVID-19
pandemic, we have experienced increased sick leave, which may adversely affect our operations, particularly our
services business for which we rely on the technical skills and institutional knowledge of our existing employees
that cannot be readily replaced with subcontractors.

We may also incur significant costs in maintaining employee health and safety requirements and, as our
operations expand, we may face increased work accidents and illness (both in frequency and severity). The
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased sick leave among our staff and a need to increase health
and safety measures throughout our operations. In addition, during periods of rapid economic growth, we may
encounter problems in recruiting and retaining qualified employees, as well as experience increased staff costs
during these periods, or a decrease in the quality of the services we provide, all of which could negatively affect
our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**A majority of our balance sheet assets consist of intangible assets, which are subject to impairment testing**
**and may affect future results of operations**

Our intangible assets are substantial and represented SEK 2,790 million as of September 30, 2020. Our intangible
assets consist primarily of goodwill.

41


-----

We capitalize goodwill relating to acquisitions, which is calculated as the difference between the historical cost
and fair value of an acquired business and the fair value of our share of the acquired business’s identifiable net
assets at the time of acquisition. Goodwill from the acquisition of operations is recognized as an intangible asset.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment testing at least annually. The identification and
measurement of impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units. Accounting for
impairment contains uncertainty because management must use judgment in determining appropriate
assumptions to be used in the measurement of fair value. The estimates of fair value of reporting units are based
on the best information available as of the date of the assessment and incorporate management assumptions about
expected future cash flows and contemplate other valuation techniques. For more information see our financial
statements included in this offering memorandum. An adverse development in our business activities may
require us to recognize impairment charges to write off all or a part of the carrying amount of our goodwill and
other intangible assets. If an expense or impairment loss must be recognized, it could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

There is significant judgement required in the analysis of a potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible
assets. The future development of the macroeconomic environment, of the COVID-19 pandemic, unsuccessful
acquisitions or other factors could lead to possibly significant impairments to be recognized in the future, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any of these developments could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or on our ability to service or otherwise make
payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness.

**Our business, strategy implementation and internal control functions could be adversely affected if we fail**
**to effectively maintain our decentralized organization and to attract and retain skilled managers,**
**personnel and key executive officers**

Our ability to maintain our competitive position and to implement our business strategy largely depends on our
decentralized organizational structure in which branch managers retain substantial autonomy regarding the
management of the operations and customer accounts, and project managers are primarily responsible for the
carrying out of individual projects. We are dependent upon the services of our employees and their respective
local customer relationships, as well as on the skills and expertise of our employees in particular projects or
particular markets. We may not be able to retain such employees in the future, and such employees could leave
us for competitors or form competing businesses themselves. Despite our decentralized model, we also depend
upon the services of our management. Any inability to attract or retain an adequate number of qualified branch
managers, project managers, key executive officers or other skilled employees could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Furthermore, while we believe decentralization is a key element of our business model and an important element
for the implementation of our strategy, decentralization necessarily places significant control and decisionmaking powers in the hands of local project and branch managers. There is a risk that those local managers will
not comply with our internal policies or processes or that we will not successfully implement future compliance
policies, update existing control procedures and compliance policies and maintain efficient reliable IT systems
required to effectively monitor our operations. The occurrence of these events on a particular project or local
branch level could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**Based on economic and other conditions impacting the markets in which our facilities are located, as well**
**as the overall performance of individual branch locations, we may be required to close or dispose of under-**
**performing branches**

We may have to close under-performing branches from time to time as warranted by general economic
conditions and/or weakness in the local markets in which we operate. Furthermore, we engage in periodic
reviews of branch performance and may decide to close or dispose of branches based on under-performance,
poor cash flow and other considerations. Our under-performing branches may not be successful in generating
future profits. If we fail to identify branches that are under-performing in a timely manner or fail to take
appropriate remedial measures to support, close or dispose of an under-performing branch in a timely manner,
such failure may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

In addition, future branch closures could result in our reduced presence in certain of our local markets, which
could potentially have an adverse effect on our ability to provide our customers comprehensive services

42


-----

throughout the Nordic region, which could adversely impact our reputation and results of operations. In addition,
branch closures may result in administrative and restructuring costs that could have a material adverse impact on
our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**We may incur liabilities for the actions of our employees**

Our employees deliver services within buildings and at locations owned or operated by our customers. As a
result, we may be subject to claims in connection with damage to property, business interruptions, unauthorized
use of the customer’s property or willful misconduct or other tortuous acts by our employees or people who have
gained unauthorized access to premises through our business operations. Such claims may be substantial and may
result in adverse publicity for our Group. Accordingly, these claims could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

**We may not be able to attract and retain key officers and directors and other management personnel**

Our ability to continue to implement our strategy (See “Business—Our Strategy”) successfully depends upon the
services of a small number of key executive officers and directors, including the Group management team. There
can be no assurance that these individuals will continue to make their services available to us in the future. The
loss of or diminution in the services of one or more of our key executive officers or directors, or our inability to
attract, retain and maintain new key executive officers or directors, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations or financial condition.

We rely heavily on our branch managers for the success of a branch. Each branch manager has the responsibility
for recruiting and retaining a quality workforce and cultivating customer loyalty. Each branch manager manages
the operations of the branch, which include recruiting, dispatching and paying of employees, meeting the needs
of our customers, maintaining customer satisfaction, selling our services to new customers, as well as controlling
costs through accident prevention, and complying with applicable laws and regulations. Our future growth and
financial performance depend on our ability to hire, train and retain qualified managers from a limited pool of
qualified candidates. If we are unable to attract, retain and successfully train our branch managers, this could
have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**Damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of**
**operations or prospects**

Our reputation is important to our ability to market our services and secure new customers. Our historical success
is attributable, in large part, to our reputation as a leading and reliable provider of a broad range of services,
particularly services requiring a certain level of technical expertise, and this reputation has strengthened our
business and helped to facilitate our expansion. Although we closely monitor the quality of our services, we
cannot guarantee that we will be able to protect our business against damage to our reputation vis-à-vis our
customers, potential customers and, more generally, in the geographic regions and business sectors in which we
operate. Any damage to our reputation or brand as a result of adverse litigation, breach of procurement laws or
regulations, third-party challenges to contracts won in public procurement procedures, failure to meet contract
deadlines or specialized performance requirements, or for any other reason, could have a material adverse effect
on our marketing and ability to obtain projects from customers, as well as our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

**We are party to public sector contracts, which may be affected by political and administrative decisions,**
**and we are subject to risks inherent in public contracts**

Public sector customers account for a significant portion of our net revenue. The success and profitability of our
public sector business may be influenced by political considerations. It may also be affected by political and
administrative decisions concerning levels of public spending. In certain cases, due to applicable regulations,
such as European Union tender rules, certain terms of public sector contracts, such as pricing terms, contract
period, the use of subcontractors and the ability to transfer receivables under contract, could result in less
flexibility than comparable private sector contracts. Public sector contracts can, if entered into or prolonged in
violation of applicable tender rules, be declared invalid by a court of law, or if questioned by a third party
competitor, risk being terminated by the public sector customer. Certain of our public sector contracts may be
subject to challenge on these grounds and could be declared invalid if they are found to be in violation of
applicable public procurement law.

43


-----

Moreover, decisions to decrease public spending may result in the termination, delay or downscaling of public
sector contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition. Historically, our performance has been linked, in part, to the ability and willingness of local, regional
and national governments to allocate public funds to infrastructure and other publicly funded projects, as well as
our ability to bid successfully for these contracts. Public sector spending, in turn, generally has been dependent
on long-term general macroeconomic conditions. A decrease in public sector spending as a result of a
deterioration in Nordic, European or global economic conditions, changes in governmental policy or other
reasons, including the COVID-19 pandemic, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results
of operations. There is a risk that a fall in public sector spending in the countries in which we operate will have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation.

Contracts in the public sector are also subject to review and monitoring by local authorities to ensure compliance
with laws and regulations prohibiting anti-competitive practices. Although we believe that we comply with these
laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not be found in violation of any such laws or
regulations, and we could be subject to fines, penalties and other sanctions, including exclusion from
participation in tenders for public contracts. Any such event would have a material adverse effect on our
reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.

**Changes in the laws and regulations governing public procurement could have a material impact on our**
**business**

As a government contractor, we are subject to a number of procurement regulations, requirements and limitations
relating to the conduct of business relationships and the formation of purchasing contracts, including prohibitions
on certain business practices that could be construed as bribery, public corruption or unfair competitive practices.
Although we maintain policies regarding compliance with these regulations, there can be no assurance that our
employees, subcontractors, agents and partners, or the public sector entities with whom they contract, will not act
in violation of such policies and/or applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore, if a public sector entity were to
violate applicable procurement laws or regulations in connection with contracts entered into with us or our
marketing activities, the relevant authorities or a competitor could seek enforcement action against us. Any such
violation, even if prohibited by our policies, could result in civil or criminal penalties, the loss of business or
harm to our reputation and, accordingly, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or
financial condition.

In addition, awards under public procurement processes may be subject to challenge or rescission based on actual
or alleged procedural deficiencies in the tender process, even after we have made significant expenditures
associated with winning such an award. We (or a public sector customer) may face actions seeking to challenge
prior awards and we may not be successful in securing a contract in any re-tendering process, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**A significant part of our net revenue is attributable to contracts awarded through a competitive bidding**
**process, which can result in substantial costs and loss of revenue if we fail to compete effectively**

With respect to installation projects, almost all of our net revenue is attributable to contracts that are awarded
through a competitive bidding process, where price is often the principal factor in determining which contractor
is selected, especially with regard to public sector projects. Some of our competitors may be willing to offer a
lower price than us, reduce staff costs, accept lower profit margins or expend more in capital to obtain or retain
customers. As a result, we may not be successful in winning awards on commercially attractive terms over our
competitors. In addition, competitive bidding results in substantial costs and presents a number of risks,
including: substantial investments in terms of cost and managerial time required to prepare bids and proposals for
contracts that may or may not be awarded to us; the need to estimate accurately the resources and costs that will
be required to service any contracts we are awarded, often in advance of the final determination of their full
scope; the expense and delay that may arise if our competitors protest or challenge awards made to us pursuant to
a competitive bidding process, and the risk that such protest or challenge could result in the requirement to
resubmit bids or in the termination, reduction or modification of the contracts that have been awarded; and the
opportunity cost of not bidding on and winning other contracts we might otherwise pursued, all of which could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**Changes in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results of operations**

The demand for our services is impacted by monetary and other government policies in each of the countries in
which we operate, including policies that have the effect of encouraging or discouraging construction, such as

44


-----

long-term interest rates, tax policies, policies encouraging or discouraging labor mobility and migration, the
availability of financing or subsidies, the allocation of government funding for public infrastructure programs
and safety regulations that encourage or discourage the use of certain materials and products. Interest rate
changes, for example, affect demand for residential and non-residential structures, which in turn affects sales of
our services that serve these activities. Interest rate changes also affect our customers’ ability to finance
purchases and can impact the ability of our suppliers to finance the production of parts and components
necessary to deliver the services we sell. In addition to changing interest rates, central banks and other policy
arms of many countries take actions to vary the amount of liquidity and credit available to such country. During
the COVID-19 pandemic, governments globally have stepped up monetary and fiscal policies to fight the
economic effects of lockdowns and containment measures. Such measures have served to stabilize conditions in
the short term to various degrees but may need to be unwound in the future. Changes in liquidity and credit
policies, including the reduction or elimination of favorable tax or other stimulus programs and reversing of
monetary policy measures, could adversely impact our customers, markets and suppliers, any of which could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**Fluctuating commodity prices may adversely impact our results of operations**

The prices of petroleum, copper, steel, aluminum and other commodities used in the products we install can be
volatile. We are not always able to quickly or effectively react to price increases by our suppliers or pass through
increased costs to our customers. A majority of our contracts allow us to pass through cost increases to our
customers. However, short-term changes in the costs of raw materials, some of which are subject to significant
fluctuations, are not always passed on to our customers, and we do not currently enter into forward sales,
commodity, derivative or hedging arrangements to establish a price in advance for the purchase of future raw
materials. Any delay in our ability to pass on material price increases to our customers could adversely impact
our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

In addition, if prices decrease for commodities, we may have inventories purchased at prices higher than
prevailing market prices. Prices and the availability of petroleum products are subject to political, economic and
market factors that are outside our control. Political events in petroleum-producing regions as well as weatherrelated events may cause the price of fuel to increase. Any significant increases in fuel or energy prices or
increased costs relating to emissions control requirements that have been or may be imposed in the future,
particularly due to climate change-related legislation, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations. Significant fluctuations in the cost of the commodities used in products we
use as a part of the services that we deliver may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

**Any failure of our third-party subcontractors or strategic partners to satisfactorily perform their**
**obligations may hurt our reputation, business and results of operations.**

We offer certain of our services to our customers through various third-party service providers engaged to
perform these services on our behalf. However, we retain responsibility for the work performed by these
subcontractors. Accordingly, we are exposed to risks relating to managing subcontractors and the risk that these
subcontractors may fail to perform the agreed-upon services satisfactorily and on a timely basis, which could
affect our ability to perform our obligations (which could lead to contractual monetary penalties) or meet our
customers’ expectations and comply with applicable regulatory requirements. In extreme cases, performance or
other deficiencies on the part of our subcontractors could result in a customer terminating our contract. A
termination could expose us to financial liabilities, damage our reputation and impair our ability to compete for
future contracts. In addition, in the event a subcontractor provides unsatisfactory services on our behalf, we could
be required to make additional investments or provide additional services to ensure the adequate performance
and delivery of the contracted services. In addition, we are exposed to the operational controls of our
subcontractors, including with respect to the qualifications of their personnel and their compliance with labor and
immigration laws. Our subcontractors may maintain inadequate insurance coverage or inadequate financial
resources to honor claims resulting from damages or losses inflicted by such subcontractors on our customers.

We constantly manage and monitor the performance of our subcontractors. However, the failure of
subcontractors to meet their contractual obligations or comply with applicable laws or regulations could harm our
reputation, as well as result in customer losses and financial liabilities, any of which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Similarly, much of our business, particularly with respect to installation in new construction projects, derives
from our strategic partnerships with leading Scandinavian construction companies that hire us as subcontractors.

45


-----

In our contracts with these construction companies, we often agree, along with all other subcontractors on the
project, to have joint and several liability for the performance of the construction company’s obligations under
the supply contract. To the extent one of our strategic partners encounters financial difficulties or otherwise
becomes unable to perform its obligations under the construction contract, we may incur substantial liabilities,
which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**We rely on third-party suppliers, and if we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient**
**number of qualified suppliers, or if there is a significant interruption in our supply chains or significant**
**fluctuation in the prices of our product supply, our results of operations could be adversely affected**

Our ability to offer a wide variety of services to our customers is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate
product supply from manufacturers or other suppliers at attractive prices. For the year ended December 31, 2019,
we estimate that our top ten suppliers accounted for 33% of our total supply costs. We may not be able to identify
and develop relationships with qualified suppliers that can satisfy our standards for quality and price and our
need to access products and supplies in a timely and efficient manner. We may be required to replace a supplier
if its products do not meet our quality, price or safety standards. Our results of operations and inventory levels
could suffer if we are unable to promptly replace a supplier that is unwilling or unable to satisfy our requirements
with a supplier providing similar products. The loss of, or substantial decrease in the availability of, products
from our suppliers, or the loss of a key supplier, could adversely impact our business, results of operations,
financial condition and cash flows.

In addition, supply interruptions could arise from shortages of raw materials, labor disputes or weather conditions
affecting products or shipments, transportation disruptions or other factors beyond our control, including closures
related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Short-term and long-term disruptions in our supply chain would result in a
need to maintain higher inventory levels as we replace similar products, a higher cost of goods and ultimately a
decrease in our net revenue and profitability. A disruption in the timely availability of our goods by our key
suppliers and the failure by our suppliers to continue to supply us with products on commercially reasonable
terms, or at all, may result in a decline of our operating margins and have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.

The cost of our services have historically been volatile and subject to fluctuations arising from changes in supply
and demand, economic conditions, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulation and trade
policies, as well as from periodic delays in the delivery of our products. We have a limited ability to control the
timing and amount of changes to prices that we will pay for our products. In addition, the supply of our products
fluctuates based on available manufacturing capacity. A shortage of capacity, or excess capacity, in the industry
can result in significant increases or decreases in market prices for those products, often within a short period of
time. Even where we are able to increase our prices to our customers, we may be unable to increase our prices in
sufficient time to absorb price increases by our suppliers. Such price fluctuations can adversely affect our
business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

**We are dependent on our relationships with strategic partners in the building and services industry,**
**including NCC, Skanska and PEAB, the three largest construction companies in the Nordic region. The**
**failure to maintain these relationships could result in the loss of business and, as a result, materially**
**adverse effects on our operating performance**

Our business, particularly with respect to installation in new construction projects, is dependent in large part on
our long-standing relationships with leading Nordic construction companies. For example, we were part of an
installation group that was hired by building contractor Skanska to conduct the planning and design of the
installation work for the new health care building in the Malmö hospital area in 2015. Recently in September
2019, Skanska entrusted the same installation group with the implementation phase of that project, an assignment
that is worth approximately SEK 1,669 million in total and of which we will be responsible for SEK
1,067 million.

Our opportunities to partner with these types of construction companies could be adversely affected if: we are
unable to achieve the objectives under our arrangements in a timely manner, or at all; our partners become
unable, unwilling or less willing to invest in new property development due to poor general market conditions,
their financial condition or other circumstances, many of which are beyond our control; we disagree with a key
partner regarding strategic direction, the economics of our relationship or other matters; we are unable to
successfully manage multiple simultaneous projects with such partners; our strategic partners breach or terminate
their contract with us; our partners become competitors of ours or enter into agreements with our competitors;

46


-----

applicable laws and regulations, domestic or foreign, impede our ability to enter into strategic arrangements; or
as we enter into additional or consolidation in the construction markets limits the number of potential industry
partners. If any of these events occur, or if we fail to maintain our agreements with our strategic partners and
collaborators, we may not be able to further develop our business or generate sufficient revenues to support our
operations. Additionally, our business could be negatively impacted if any of our industry partners undergo a
change of control, assign the rights or obligations under any of our agreements or cease to be a going concern.
We may be exposed to the credit risk of certain of our customers and, in addition, our liability to customers under
guarantee provisions may materially and adversely affect our earnings.

We sell installation and services solutions to our customers through contracts that are not secured by collateral or
other security and therefore bear the risk that our customers will be unable to pay amounts due to us. Our
products are sold to customers in industries that may experience fluctuations in demand based on economic
conditions, energy prices, seasonality, consumer demand and other factors beyond our control. These industries
include the construction industry. We may not be able to limit our potential loss of revenues if a significant
number of customers are unable to pay amounts due to us on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

At the same time, we generally provide guarantees for completed projects as to the proper operation and
conformance to specifications of our installations and services. The failure of our installations to operate properly
or to meet specifications may increase our costs by requiring additional engineering resources and services, the
replacement of parts and equipment or monetary reimbursement to a customer. We have in the past received
guarantee claims, are subject to guarantee claims and we expect to continue to receive them in the future. To the
extent that we incur substantial guarantee claims in any period, our reputation, our ability to obtain future
business and our earnings could be adversely affected.

**Our competitive position could be adversely affected by changes in technology and industry standards**

Our business requires a high level of technical expertise for a wide variety of services. We need to constantly
adapt our expertise in response to technological innovations, as well as industry standards, product instructions
and customer requirements. New technology or changes in industry and customer requirements may render some
of our services obsolete, excessively costly or otherwise unmarketable.

As a result, we must continuously enhance our expertise and the efficiency and reliability of our services in order
to remain at the forefront of industry standards and customer requirements. If we are unable to adapt to everchanging technologies and customer requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner, our competitive position
will suffer and our prospects for growth will be impaired, which would adversely affect our business and results
of operations.

**A change in supplier rebates due to the loss of our leading market position or other market conditions or a**
**deterioration in our commercial relationship with one or more key suppliers could adversely affect our**
**income and gross margins**

The terms on which we purchase products from many of our suppliers enable us to receive a rebate based on the
volume of our purchases. These rebates effectively reduce our costs. Our ability to earn and negotiate rebates is
critical to the success of our business. If market conditions change or if we lose our leading market position,
suppliers may respond by changing the terms of some or all of these purchasing programs to our detriment. Any
such changes could lower our gross margins or revenues. Furthermore, a loss of market share could result in a
decreased demand for our services, which could cause our volume requirements for certain products to decline. If
we are unable to meet specified volume thresholds for certain suppliers, we may not receive favorable rebates,
which could increase our costs and decrease our gross margins.

In addition, some of our suppliers are not obligated under long-term supply agreements to continue to sell to us.
We have relatively few sources of supply for some of the products that we purchase, and in some cases we rely
on a small group of suppliers for certain key products. In addition, the lead time involved in the manufacturing of
some of these components can be lengthy. If certain of our key suppliers become unwilling or unable to supply
us with components meeting our requirements, we may not be able to organize additional or replacement
suppliers in a timely manner, or at all. Moreover, we maintain low levels of inventory and our suppliers deliver
directly to our work sites, which prevents us from being able to provide replacement supplies on our own should
one or more or our suppliers fail to meet our supply requirements. The inability or unwillingness of our suppliers
to provide timely delivery of products necessary for our installations and services projects could cause our
services to be disrupted and our results of operations to decline.

47


-----

**Our operations could be adversely affected if a significant number of our customers terminate their**
**services contracts prior to the end of the contractual term or select another provider following the**
**expiration of their contracts**

We perform some of our service work for customers under contracts with a stated term and, in some cases, with
termination clauses permitting the customer to cancel the contract at the customer’s discretion following the
expiration of an agreed notice period. There can be no assurance that our customers will not exercise their rights
to terminate their contracts prior to expiration or that we will be successful in negotiating new contracts with
customers as such contracts expire. We generally execute our business through numerous small contracts
(including multiple contracts for the same customers) and, therefore, any cancellation of a contract or a number
of contracts would not ordinarily have an adverse effect on our results of operations. However, contract
cancellations or dissatisfaction with our services may damage our reputation and make it more difficult for us to
obtain similar contracts with other customers, in which case our business and results of operations would be
adversely affected.

**Amounts included in our estimated order backlog may not result in actual revenue or translate into**
**profits, and our estimated order backlog is subject to delays, customer bankruptcy, accounting errors and**
**unexpected adjustments and is therefore an uncertain indicator of future results of operations**

As of September 30, 2020, our order backlog was SEK 8,245 million, which represented 81.4% of our net
revenue for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020. Although our backlog only includes expected sales
under committed contracts with customers, there can be no assurance that these contractual terms would not
change, and that the backlog will result in an actual recognition of revenue within the period initially anticipated,
if at all. In addition, certain contracts included in our estimated order backlog may not be profitable. We may
experience variances in the realization of our estimated order backlog because of project delays or cancellations
resulting from weather conditions, project deferrals or delays, scope adjustments, external market factors and
economic factors beyond our control. If our estimated order backlog fails to materialize as we anticipated, our
business, financial condition or results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. Accordingly,
our estimated order backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of future revenue or earnings.

Our order backlog does not provide a precise indication of the time period over which we are contractually
entitled to receive such revenue and there is no assurance that such revenues will be actually received by us in the
time frames anticipated, or at all. Our order backlog is computed based on facts known and assumptions deemed
appropriate at the computation date. Although under our unilateral termination rights relating to defined
termination events, our order backlog is based on the full contractual period, as we estimate that, based on our
operating history and course of dealing with our customers, these contracts are more likely than not to reach their
full term and be continued for the duration of their option periods.

Unforeseen events or circumstances, including, for example, the termination or scaling down of service contracts,
may affect the backlog and could negatively impact our earnings and financial position. There can be no
assurance that the revenue projected in our order backlog will be realized or, if realized, that it will result in
profits. Because of contract terminations or suspensions and changes in contract scope and schedule, we cannot
predict with certainty when, or if, our order backlog will be achieved. We can provide no assurance that we will
not receive additional terminations, and, even where a contract proceeds as scheduled, it is possible that the
customer may default and fail to pay amounts owed by it, including due to customer bankruptcies as a result of
the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise. To the extent we are unable to realize the pipeline of revenue associated
with contracts in our backlog due to material delays, terminations or payment defaults, our business, financial
condition and results of operation could be adversely affected. See “—Our business may be adversely affected by
_difficult economic conditions and other factors beyond our control” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis_
_of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—_
_Seasonality.” Finally, our definition of backlog may not necessarily be the same as that used by other companies_
engaged in activities similar to us. As a result, the amount of backlog reported by us may not be comparable to
the backlog reported by such other companies.

**We may incur liabilities that are not covered by insurance**

We maintain insurance policies to protect our core businesses against loss or potential liability arising from
contracting parties and third party claims. Risks that generally are insured include claims that naturally may
occur in our business operations, for example, damage on our property, business interruption, damage on third
parties’ property or public and production liability. Additionally, we obtain insurance coverage for certain

48


-----

specific larger projects. Nevertheless, not all claims are insurable and there can be no assurance that we will not
experience major incidents that are not covered by our insurance. Furthermore, the occurrence of several events
resulting in substantial claims for damages within a calendar year may have a material adverse effect on our
business. In addition, our insurance costs may increase over time in response to any negative development in our
claims history or due to material price increases in the insurance market in general. There can be no assurance
that we will be able to maintain our current insurance coverage or do so at a reasonable cost.

**We may not be able to successfully defend against claims made against us by customers or other third**
**parties, or we may fail to adequately recover on our claims against customers or third parties**

We may encounter difficulties in meeting contractual performance obligations, including due to the COVID-19
pandemic, which may result in the incurrence of penalties for non-performance or a delay in the performance of
our contractual obligations. In addition, we rely on third-party partners, equipment manufacturers and
subcontractors to complete some of our contracts. As such, claims involving customers, suppliers and
subcontractors may be brought against us, and by us, in connection with our contracts or with customers’ internal
procedures. Claims brought against us could include back charges for alleged defective or incomplete work,
breaches of warranty and/or late completion of the project and claims for cancelled projects. The claims and back
charges can involve actual damages, as well as contractually agreed-upon liquidated sums. These claims, as well
as claims we may make against customers or other third parties, if not resolved through negotiation, could result
in lengthy and expensive litigation or arbitration proceedings.

We occasionally bring claims against project owners for additional costs that exceed the contract price or for
amounts not included in the original contract price, including change orders. These types of claims occur due to
matters such as owner-caused delays, increased unit prices or changes from the initial project scope that result,
both directly and indirectly, in additional costs. Often, these claims can be the subject of lengthy arbitration,
litigation or third-party expert proceedings, and it can be difficult to accurately predict when these claims will be
fully resolved. When these types of events occur and unresolved claims are pending, we may invest significant
working capital in projects to cover cost overruns pending the resolution of the relevant claims. Charges
associated with claims, or our failure to recover sufficient damages and/or liquidated sums in connection with
claims we bring against third parties, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

**If we fail to ensure safe work environments for our employees, we could be exposed to significant financial**
**losses, as well as civil and criminal liabilities**

Our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to the maintenance of safe conditions in the
workplace. The industry in which we operate involves a certain degree of operational risk, such as working with
high voltages, heat and at heights, which cannot be fully eliminated by procedures implemented to address them.
These hazards can cause personal injury or death, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and
other consequential damages and could lead to the suspension of operations and large damage claims and, in
extreme cases, criminal liability.

If we were to fail to implement any safety or other procedures with respect to our sites, or if the procedures we
implement were deemed to be ineffective, our employees or others may suffer injury and we could incur
significant financial losses. In addition, we could be found liable for failing to comply with government
regulation dealing with occupational health and safety. Occurrence of any of these events could cause a
materially adverse effect on our operations and profitability. Our failure, or the failure of one of our
subcontractors, to comply with applicable regulations or to maintain a safe work environment could result in
substantial fines, claims relating to violations of social and working environment legislation or the revocation of
licenses. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to claims relating to employees’ working
conditions. Any such claims, or increased costs resulting from such claims or regulatory changes, could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Additionally, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, our worksites and offices will have to implement and
maintain measures designed to stop the spread of the virus, including sanitation, social distancing and mask
wearing. Failure to maintain these measures can lead to outbreaks of the virus in our worksites and offices,
leading to closures which can have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

New technology and the implementation of new work processes, services, tools and machinery may also have
unforeseen effects on the working conditions of our employees. In addition, our employees may be exposed to

49


-----

materials that, although not currently considered harmful, could in the future be deemed health hazards, as was
the case with asbestos. Unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase project costs for our customers and
raise our operating costs. Any of the foregoing could result in financial losses, which could have a material
adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**Failure to comply with transfer pricing regulations may result in the payment of additional tax or**
**penalties by us**

The markets in which we operate have transfer pricing regulations that require transactions involving associated
companies to be at arm’s length. Arrangements between members of our Group, such as intra-Group transactions
involving management services, royalties, information technology service fees, cash-pool arrangements, intraGroup loans and consultancy fees, are typically carried out on an arm’s-length basis. However, if the tax
authorities in any relevant jurisdiction do not regard such arrangements as being made on an arm’s-length basis
and successfully challenge those arrangements, the amount of tax payable by the relevant member or members of
our Group, in respect of both current and previous years, may increase materially and penalties or interest may be
payable. Furthermore, any failure to file transfer pricing documentation evidencing the outcome of applied
pricing principles, should they be requested by the relevant tax authorities, may result in penalties.

**We are exposed to risks in connection with derivative instruments and hedging transactions.**

We use derivative financial instruments (primarily currency and interest rate swaps and interest rate ceilings) to
help limit and control foreign exchange and interest rate risks. Such transactions involve risks, particularly, if the
interest or exchange rate development differs from expectations. The projections and assumptions made by our
risk management team at the time when such transactions were entered into could prove to be incorrect and the
transactions could fail to limit the risks as intended or increase our costs. This could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we intend to hedge some or all
of our interest rate and currency risk under the Notes since the majority of our revenues are paid in currency
other than euros, which is the currency of the Notes. Such hedges are senior obligations of the Issuer and rank
pari passu in right of payment with the Notes and obligations under the Super Senior Facilities, and together with
the Notes, the Super Senior Facilities are secured by first-priority security interests over the Collateral; provided,
however, that, under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, certain hedges are “super senior” in terms of the
receipt of the proceeds of enforcement of Collateral until such super senior hedges and obligations under the
Super Senior Facilities have been repaid in full. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement.” If we were to default in making payments under the Notes, or if certain other credit_
events were to occur in relation to us and a credit-linked hedge of interest rate or currency risk in respect of such
Notes were to terminate or be closed out as a result, then, in relation to the mark-to-market (“MTM”) value
which would normally be payable by one party to the other on a termination or close-out of an equivalent hedge
that was not credit-linked, either (a) we will be limited, where such MTM value would otherwise be payable to
us, in claiming against our hedge counterparty in respect of such termination or close-out to an amount equal to
the product of (i) such MTM value and (ii) the credit recovery rate for holders of the Notes, such credit recovery
rate being determined within a reasonable period after such termination or close-out by reference to a market
auction process or market quotations for such notes, or (b) no MTM payment in respect of such termination or
close-out will be due from either party, depending on the particular type of credit-linked hedge into which we
enter.

**We are exposed to translation risk of currency fluctuations**

Our business operations are characterized by a relatively low level of transactional currency risk since our
purchases and sales are made in the same local currency with minimal exposure to imported components. From
an accounting perspective, we are exposed to risks relating to translation into Swedish kronor of income
statements and balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries with local reporting denominated in euro (in the case of
operations in Finland) and Norwegian kroner. In order to prepare our combined financial statements, we must
translate foreign currency assets, liabilities, net revenue and expenses into Swedish kronor. For balance sheet
items, foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates applicable on the
transaction date. For income statement items, foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the
average exchange rate applicable to the period. Consequently, increases and decreases in the value of the
Swedish krona against other currencies affect the amount of these items in our combined financial statements,
even if their value has not changed in their original currency. A 5% strengthening of the euro as of December 31,
2019 would have had a positive translation effect on equity of SEK 3.4 million and the same increase in value of
the Norwegian krone would have had a positive translation effect on equity of SEK 2.8 million.

**The trend toward greater outsourcing of services and maintenance by public institutions and private**
**companies may slow or reverse, which could adversely affect our business, including our financial**
**condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects**

Growth in demand for technical services is also influenced by trends other than macroeconomic trends, including
outsourcing. Over the past several years, our business has benefited from increased levels of the outsourcing of
installation and services activities by public institutions and private companies. The development of outsourced
services may be affected by political decisions, public opinion, positive and negative experiences with
outsourcing, and demand by public institutions and private users. These factors may negatively impact growth,
cause contracts to be discontinued or reduce our ability to achieve satisfactory growth rates in the future, all of
which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of
operations.

**The residential, non-residential and infrastructure construction markets are seasonal and our business**
**operations may be affected by adverse weather conditions**

We experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for certain of our services, due primarily to weather and
holiday seasons. Although weather patterns affect our results of operations throughout the year, cold and wet
weather during the winter months has historically reduced construction activity primarily in the first quarter in
our markets. In contrast, our highest volume of net revenue historically has occurred in September through
November. Generally, during the winter months, new construction activity declines due to inclement weather and
to the holiday season. Public holidays and vacation, particularly in the months of June and July, also have
seasonality effects, because building projects or industrial production processes may slow or temporarily cease.
As a result, our results of operations may vary significantly from period to period. We anticipate that fluctuations
from period to period will continue in the future.

In addition, cold weather is less favorable for construction projects and delays installation work because it
hinders site accessibility. Adverse weather conditions, particularly during the winter season, could affect the
ability of our employees to perform efficient work outdoors in certain regions of Sweden, Finland, and Norway.
We may experience reduced cash flow if unseasonal weather conditions persist, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**Changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax position could adversely affect our results of operations and**
**financial condition**

We are subject to complex tax laws in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes in tax laws could
adversely affect our tax position, including our effective tax rate or tax payments. In addition, Swedish, Finnish,
Norwegian and European and other international tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and are subject
to varying interpretations. We often rely on generally available interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the
jurisdictions in which we operate. We cannot be certain that the relevant tax authorities are in agreement with our
interpretation of these laws. If our tax positions are challenged by relevant tax authorities, the imposition of
additional taxes could require us to pay taxes that we currently do not collect or pay or increase the costs of our
services to track and collect such taxes, which could increase our costs of operations and have a negative effect
on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. For example, Swedish and Norwegian
tax authorities challenged the deductibility of interest on our shareholder loans, and while discussions with tax
authorities continue, we have taken appropriate provisions for our tax positions in our results of operations,
which are reflected through an increase in tax for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018 in our Audited
Combined Financial Statements.

**We occupy most of our facilities under short- and medium-term leases. We may be unable to renew leases**
**at the end of their terms. If we close a facility, we remain obligated under the applicable lease**

Most of our facilities are located in leased premises. Most of our leases are non-cancellable and short- or
medium-term. We believe that leases we enter into in the future will likely be on similar terms as our current
leases. We may be unable to renew our leases at the end of their terms, or the terms of such renewal may be less
favorable to us than those under the current leases. If we close a facility, we generally remain committed to
perform our obligations under the applicable lease, which includes the payment of the base rent for the balance of
the lease term. Over the course of the last few years, we closed a number of facilities for which we remain liable
on the lease obligations. Our obligation to continue making rent payments in respect of leases for closed facilities
could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

**Any significant failure or interruption of our information technology systems could adversely affect our**
**business**

We use information systems and other technology to conduct and manage our business, including a significant
amount of systems and other technology provided by third party providers through outsourcing. Our ability to
efficiently run and monitor our decentralized organization is dependent on a well-functioning information
technology system integrated throughout the organization. In order to manage our growth and improve our
performance, we must maintain and continuously upgrade and improve these technology systems and processes.
We may not be able to develop and implement, on a timely basis, projects, systems, procedures and controls
required to support the growth and development of our operations. If we are unable to manage our growth and
improve our performance, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely
affected.

We rely on information technology systems that allow us to track and bill our services, communicate with our
customers, manage our employees and gather information upon which our management makes decisions
regarding our business. The administration of our business is increasingly dependent on the use of these systems.
As a result, system failures or disruptions resulting from disasters, computer viruses, hackers or other causes
could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, pursuant to contracts with third-party vendors,
we outsource the operation and maintenance of certain of our information technology systems to seek to ensure
effective management of our information technology resources, as well as to improve the cost efficiency of our
information technology infrastructure, systems and applications. We rely on the ability of our outsourcing
partners to deliver agreed services. Their failure to perform satisfactorily could have a material adverse impact on
our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**We may be required to make further contributions to our pension schemes if the value of pension fund**
**assets is not sufficient to cover potential obligations**

Some of our white-collar employees in Sweden are covered by a defined benefit pension plan, which is
accounted for in accordance with IAS 19 under which we are required to provide agreed benefits to current and
former employees. Other employees have pensions that are recognized as defined-contribution.

As of December 31, 2019, approximately 30% of our employees had defined benefit pensions. Of these, the
Swedish plan for electricity white-collar employees is unfunded and based on final salary, which provides
employees with benefits in the form of a guaranteed level of pension disbursements over their lifetimes and is
recognized as defined benefit for purposes of our financial statements. For the remaining white-collar employees
in Sweden the defined-benefit pension obligations are secured through insurance with Alecta and are accounted
for as a defined contribution plan.

Pension scheme liabilities vary with changes to long-term interest rates, inflation, pensionable salaries and the
longevity of scheme members. Our liabilities in respect of provisions for pensions increased from
SEK 483 million as of December 31, 2017, to SEK 560 million as of December 31, 2018, to SEK 703 million as
of December 31, 2019 before decreasing slightly to SEK 690 million as of September 30, 2020, which was
driven primarily by a decline in market interest rates, which resulted in the assumed discount rate for definedbenefit obligations decreasing from 2.40% as of December 31, 2018 to 1.40% at December 31, 2019 to 1.30% at
September 30, 2020. The increase in liabilities in respect of provisions for pensions also reflects the relatively
greater proportion of plan participants that are not eligible for retirement, as compared to the number of former
plan participants that have retired. Changes to local legislation and regulations relating to defined benefit plan
funding requirements may also result in significant deviations in the timing and size of the expected cash
contributions under such plans. For example, in the year ended December 31, 2019, actuarial losses and financial
commitments related to pensions liability amounted to SEK 90 million. Increases in our pensions liability could
adversely affect our financial condition.

In accordance with the requirements of the pension administrator, we are required to provide bank guarantees in
respect of a portion of the Group’s defined-benefit pensions obligations. We have been required to increase the
amount of our current SEK 240 million bank guarantee (incurred under the Pension Guarantee Facility) by SEK
45 million, which additional amount was initially incurred under the Guarantee Facility. We expect to ultimately
incur the full SEK 285 million under the Pension Guarantee Facility once we have increased the SEK 240 million
of aggregate commitments thereunder by SEK 45 million, as permitted under the terms of the Pension Guarantee
Facility Agreement to reflect increased guarantee requirements by the pension administrator (and to cancel the
amount initially incurred under the Guarantee Facility). Our obligations with respect to the Pension Guarantee

52


-----

Facility and the Guarantee Facility are secured on the Collateral on a super senior basis to the Notes. See
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—The Super Senior Facilities.” Availability of the additional
guarantee amounts under the Pension Guarantee Facility or the Guarantee Facility, however, is subject to certain
conditions, including compliance with certain financial covenants. Moreover, lenders under the Pension
Guarantee Facility may not be able to increase the size of their commitments thereunder in time to satisfy the
deadline set by the pension administrator or at all. If the Swedish pensions regulatory authority requires us to
provide bank guarantees of our pensions liabilities or increase the size of our pre-existing bank guarantees in
excess of the amounts that are available to us, this may result in additional financial obligations being imposed
on us by the regulator, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

**Work stoppages or strikes could adversely affect our business**

We are required to comply with local labor law requirements (including in respect of minimum salary levels as
well as employee conditions) in the jurisdictions where our employees perform their work. Changes with regard
to labor laws in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could restrict our ability to utilize employees away
from their home jurisdiction, result in increased labor costs, including increases due to healthcare reforms or
minimum wage increase, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation
and financial condition.

Many of our employees are members of unions, and most of our employees who work in our warehouses are
covered by collective bargaining agreements. We may encounter strikes or other disturbances, or threats of
strikes or disturbances occasioned by our unionized labor force and, upon the expiration of existing collective
bargaining agreements, we may be unable to reach new collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or
without work stoppages, strikes or similar industrial actions. Our inability to negotiate satisfactory terms for new
agreements would likely cause our labor costs to increase, which would negatively affect our profit margins if we
are unable to pass the additional costs on to our customers.

When we acquire companies and integrate them into our existing operations, we frequently enter into
negotiations to restructure or reduce the workforce at the acquired company. We may experience lengthier
consultations or even strikes, work stoppages or other industrial actions in the future, particularly when we are
engaged in restructuring and reducing our workforce. Any industrial action or threat thereof could disrupt our
operations, possibly for a significant period of time, and result in increased wages and benefits or otherwise have
a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**Risks Related to the Fidelix Acquisition**

**The Fidelix Acquisition is subject to certain conditions and risks**

On December 8, 2020, Assemblin AB entered into the Fidelix Acquisition Agreement to acquire the Target from
the Sellers. The Fidelix Acquisition is subject to approval from the Finnish competition authority. The parties to
the Fidelix Acquisition Agreement will not consummate the Fidelix Acquisition until the conditions under the
Fidelix Acquisition Agreement are fulfilled. Accordingly, the parties may not be able to complete the Fidelix
Acquisition in a timely fashion, without remedies, or at all. Any such remedies may make the Fidelix Acquisition
less attractive.

Consummation of the Fidelix Acquisition is one of the conditions to the release of proceeds of the Offering from
the Escrow Account. If the Acquisition is not consummated on or before the Escrow Longstop Date or upon the
occurrence of certain other events, the Temporary Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption as
described in ‘‘Description of the Temporary Notes—Special Mandatory Redemption’’ and you may not obtain
the return you expect to receive on the Temporary Notes.

The realization of any risks related to uncertainties of the Fidelix Acquisition could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

**If the conditions to the release of the proceeds of the Offering set forth in the Escrow Agreement are not**
**satisfied, the Temporary Notes will be redeemed and you may not get the return you expect on the**
**Temporary Notes**

The gross proceeds from the Offering will be held in the Escrow Account in the name of the Issuer but controlled
by the Escrow Agent and pledged in favor of the Temporary Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Temporary
Notes pending the satisfaction of certain conditions, some of which are outside of our control. If the Fidelix

53


-----

Acquisition is not consummated by the Escrow Longstop Date, or upon the occurrence of certain other events,
the Temporary Notes will be subject to the Special Mandatory Redemption provision described in “Description
_of the Temporary Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” and you may not obtain the_
investment return you expect to receive on the Notes after the redemption date.

The escrow funds will be initially limited to the gross proceeds of the Offering. The escrow funds will not be
sufficient to pay the Special Mandatory Redemption price, which will be equal to 100% of the aggregate issue
price of the Temporary Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts then required to be paid
under the Temporary Notes, if any, from the Issue Date to, but excluding, the date of the Special Mandatory
Redemption. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient funds to pay the difference between the
escrow funds and amounts sufficient to pay the Special Mandatory Redemption price. See “Description of the
_Temporary Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”_

**Amendments made to the Fidelix Acquisition Agreement may have adverse consequences for holders of**
**the Notes**

The Fidelix Acquisition is expected to be consummated in accordance with the terms of the Fidelix Acquisition
Agreement. However, the Fidelix Acquisition Agreement may be amended and the closing conditions may be
waived at any time by the parties thereto, without the consent of the holders of the Notes; provided that no
material term or condition of the Fidelix Acquisition Agreement has been amended or waived in a manner or to
an extent that would be materially prejudicial to the interests of the holders of the Temporary Notes (taken as a
whole) under the Temporary Indenture (other than any amendment or waiver approved by holders of more than
50% of the outstanding principal amount of the Temporary Notes the proceeds of which are in the Escrow
Account). Any amendment made to the Fidelix Acquisition Agreement, or waiver of the conditions to the closing
of the Fidelix Acquisition, may be adverse to the interests of the holders of the Notes, which, in turn, may have
an adverse effect on the investment return you expect to receive on the Notes.

**We do not currently control the Target and will not control the Target until completion of the Fidelix**
**Acquisition**

The Target is currently controlled by the Sellers. We will not obtain control of the Target until the completion of
the Fidelix Acquisition. We cannot assure you that the Sellers will operate the business during the interim period
in the same way that we would and we cannot assure you that, following the Completion Date, we will operate
the business in the same way that the Sellers have operated the business in the past. The information contained in
this offering memorandum about the Target, including the historical financial information relating to the Target,
has been provided to us by the Target’s management, and we have relied on such information supplied to us in
the preparation of this offering memorandum.

Furthermore, the Fidelix Acquisition has required, and will likely continue to require, substantial time and focus
from management of both the Group and the Target, which could adversely affect our ability to operate the
respective businesses of the Group and the Target. The integration process could divert our management’s
attention from day-to-day operations or disrupt our ongoing business, which could in turn adversely affect our
ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of
the Fidelix Acquisition, or could otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results. See “—Risks
_Related to our Business and Industry—Our growth strategy involves acquisitions, and we may experience_
_difficulties identifying acquisition targets, integrating acquired businesses and achieving anticipated synergies.”_

In addition, prior to the Completion Date, the Target will not be subject to the covenants described in
“Description of the Temporary Notes” and “Description of the Notes” to be included in the Temporary Indenture
and the Indenture, respectively. As such, we cannot assure you that, prior to such date, the Target will not take an
action that would otherwise have been prohibited by the Temporary Indenture or the Indenture had such
covenants been applicable.

**The Fidelix Acquisition may entitle the Target’s customers and certain of its other business partners to**
**terminate their agreements as a result of change of control provisions**

The Fidelix Acquisition will constitute a change of control under certain agreements entered into by the Target
and its subsidiaries, such as commercial agreements with some of its suppliers, and will entitle these third parties
to terminate their agreements with the Target or, in some cases, request adjustments of the terms of the
agreements. In addition, some of the third parties may use their termination or adjustment rights to renegotiate
the terms of the agreements to our detriment. We cannot exclude the possibility that some of these third parties
may exercise their termination, adjustment or other rights, which could have a material adverse effect on our and
the Target’s business, results of operations and financial position following the Fidelix Acquisition.

54


-----

**We may not be able to enforce claims relating to a breach of the representations and warranties provided**
**in connection with the Fidelix Acquisition and our ability to recover losses suffered as a result of such a**
**breach may be limited**

In connection with the Fidelix Acquisition, the Sellers have given certain customary representations and
warranties and indemnities. Nonetheless, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities
the Sellers have agreed to retain, and we may not be able to enforce any claims against the Sellers relating to
breaches of these representations and warranties. For example, the liability of the Sellers under the Fidelix
Acquisition Agreement is limited by, among other limitations, certain maximum monetary thresholds, as well as
time limits. Moreover, even if we are able to eventually recover any losses resulting from a breach of these
representations and warranties, we may temporarily be required to bear these losses ourselves. In addition, if a
Seller becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy, our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that
Seller’s breach may be limited by the liquidity of such Seller or the applicable laws governing the bankruptcy
proceedings. In the event of such breach, we could incur losses, which could adversely impact our business,
results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

**The Target may have liabilities that are not known to us or that are greater than anticipated**

The Target may have liabilities that we failed or were unable to discover in the course of performing due
diligence investigations in connection with the Fidelix Acquisition. In addition, the extent of liabilities we
discovered in connection with our due diligence investigations or after the Fidelix Acquisition may be greater
than we expected. We may learn of additional information about Fidelix Holding Oy that adversely affects us,
such as unknown or contingent liabilities and issues relating to compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
For example, we could become liable for overdue payables of Fidelix Holding Oy to suppliers and employees
that are not currently known to us, or we could become subject to tax or pension liabilities in respect of historical
periods that we are not currently aware of or the amount of which we underestimated. In conducting our due
diligence, we were required to rely on resources available to us, including public information, information
provided by the Sellers and third-party consultants and advisers. There can be no assurance that the due diligence
we undertook has revealed or highlighted all relevant facts necessary or helpful in evaluating the Fidelix
Acquisition. Any such unknown or previously underestimated liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to
fulfill our obligations under the Notes.

**Risks Related to Our Structure**

**The Note Guarantees and security interests on the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on**
**enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their**
**validity and enforceability**

The Indenture provides that certain Note Guarantees will be limited to the maximum amount that can be
guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor without rendering the relevant Note Guarantee voidable or otherwise
ineffective under applicable law and enforcement of each Note Guarantee would be subject to certain generally
available defenses. These laws and defenses include those that relate to corporate benefit, fraudulent transfer or
conveyance, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws,
regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. Additionally, in accordance with local laws, the
Security Agent and/or the Trustee may not be able to represent the holders of the Additional Notes in a court
process without a specific power of attorney. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note
_Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance and other laws, a
court could subordinate or void the Note Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral granted by the
relevant Security Documents and, if payment had already been made under a Note Guarantee or upon
enforcement of the Collateral, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant Guarantor, if the court
found that:

Š the relevant Note Guarantee or security interest under the Security Documents was incurred with actual
intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or security provider or, in
certain jurisdictions, even when the recipient was simply aware that the Guarantor or security provider was
insolvent when it granted the relevant Note Guarantee or security;

Š the Guarantor or security provider did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for the
relevant Note Guarantee or security interest under a Security Document and the Guarantor or security

55


-----

provider was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Note Guarantee or security interest;
(ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Note Guarantee or security interest;
or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity;

Š the relevant Note Guarantees or Security Documents were held to exceed the corporate objective of the
Guarantor or security provider or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor
or security provider; or

Š the amount paid or payable under the relevant Note Guarantee or the enforcement proceeds under the
relevant Security Documents was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon applicable governing
law. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness:

Š the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, is greater than the fair value of all its assets;

Š the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay the probable liability on its
existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become due; or

Š it cannot pay its debts as they become due.

If a court were to find that the issuance of the Notes or a Note Guarantee was a fraudulent conveyance or held it
unenforceable for any other reason, the court could hold that the payment obligations under the Notes or such
Guarantee are ineffective, or require the holders of the Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the
Notes or such Note Guarantee. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent conveyance occurred, you may cease to
have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable,
of the other Guarantors under any Note Guarantees that have not been declared void.

Additionally, any future pledge of Collateral in favor of the Security Agent, including pursuant to Security
Documents delivered after the date of the Indenture, might be avoidable by the security provider (as
debtor-in-possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy (or similar officer) if certain events or circumstances exist or
occur, including, among others, if the security provider is insolvent at the time of the pledge, the pledge permits
the holders of the Additional Notes to receive a greater recovery than if the pledge had not been given and a
bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the security provider is commenced within three months following the
pledge, or in certain circumstances, a longer period.

In order to receive the benefit of a security interest, the secured creditors must hold secured claims (in other
words, the secured party and the creditor have to be the same person).

In addition, under the terms of the Indenture, we are permitted in the future to incur additional indebtedness and
other obligations that may share in the liens on the Collateral securing the Additional Notes and the liens on the
collateral securing our other secured debt. The granting of new security interests may require the releasing and
retaking of security or otherwise create new hardening periods in certain jurisdictions. The applicable hardening
period for these new security interests will run from the moment each new security interest has been granted or
perfected. At each time, if the security interest granted or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the
respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective and it may not
be possible to enforce it.

**The insolvency laws of Sweden and Norway may not be as favorable to you as U.S. bankruptcy laws and**
**may preclude holders of the Notes from recovering payments due on the Notes**

The Issuer is established under the laws of Sweden, and certain of the Guarantors are established under the laws
of Sweden and Norway. Consequently, in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency of the Issuer or any of the
Guarantors, insolvency proceedings with respect to the Issuer or the Guarantors would most likely be based on
and governed by the insolvency laws of the jurisdiction under which the relevant entity is established. The
insolvency laws of Sweden and Norway may be less favorable to your interests as creditors than the bankruptcy
laws of the United States or another jurisdiction with which you may be familiar, particularly with respect to the
priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceedings.
The application of these laws, and any conflict between them, may limit your ability to recover payments due on
the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws. See “Limitations on Validity
_and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

56


-----

**Enforcing your rights as a holder of Notes or under the Note Guarantees or security across multiple**
**jurisdictions may prove difficult**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Sweden and the Guarantors are incorporated or organized under the
laws of Sweden and Norway. The Collateral for the Additional Notes will include the shares of certain of our
subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of these jurisdictions, as well as shares in the Target, which is
incorporated under the laws of Finland. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings
could be initiated in Sweden, Norway and Finland. Such multijurisdictional proceedings are likely to be complex
and costly for creditors and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of
your rights. Your rights under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to the insolvency
and administrative laws of several jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that you will be able to effectively
enforce your rights in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings. The
multijurisdictional nature of enforcement over the Collateral may limit the realizable value of the Collateral.

Moreover, in certain jurisdictions, it is unclear whether all security interests in the Collateral give the Security
Agent a right to prevent other creditors from foreclosing on and realizing the Collateral or whether certain
security interests only give the Security Agent priority in the distribution of any proceeds of such realization.
Accordingly, the Security Agent and holders of the Additional Notes may not be able to avoid foreclosure by
other creditors (including unsecured creditors) on the Collateral.

**You may be unable to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities laws violations**

The Issuer is organized under the laws of Sweden and the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Sweden
and Norway. Neither the Issuer nor the Guarantors have assets in the United States. Some or all of the directors
and executive officers of the Issuer may be non-residents of the United States and many of their assets will be
located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process
within the United States upon the Issuer or its directors and executive officers, or to enforce any judgments
obtained in U.S. courts predicated upon civil liability provisions of U.S. securities laws. In addition, the Issuer
cannot assure investors that civil liabilities predicated upon federal securities laws of the United States will be
enforceable in Sweden. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security
_Interests.”_

**Risks Related to Our Financial Profile**

**Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations may make it difficult for us to fulfil our obligations**
**under the Notes and operate our business**

We have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness with significant debt service requirements. After
giving effect to the Transactions (excluding the Fidelix Acquisition, but including the Offering and the use of
proceeds thereof), our total financial indebtedness (including the Temporary Notes) would have been SEK
4,459 million (or approximately €384 million) as of September 30, 2020.

Our significant leverage could have important consequences for holders of the Notes, including, but not limited
to:

Š making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our other debt and
liabilities;

Š requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our debt instead of operations,
thus reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund internal growth through working capital, capital
expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures, product research and development, and other general corporate
purposes;

Š increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, a downturn in our business, or
generally adverse economic or industry conditions;

Š placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged as us;

Š limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive
environment and industry;

Š restricting us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or exploiting certain business opportunities;

Š limiting, among other things, our and our subsidiaries’ ability to borrow additional funds, including with
respect to financial leases on which we rely for replacement and expansion of our vehicle fleet, or raise
equity capital in the future and increasing the costs of such additional financings;

57


-----

Š exposing us to risks that are inherent in interest rate fluctuations because certain of our indebtedness
(including the Notes) bears variable rates of interest; and

Š subjecting us to restrictive covenants, including, in the case of our Super Senior Facilities, financial
covenants, the non-compliance with which could result in an event of default under, or acceleration of, our
indebtedness.

In addition, over the next three years, additional variable cash consideration of up to approximately
SEK 160 million may be payable in connection with acquisitions we have undertaken as of the date hereof.

We primarily expect to use cash flow from operations and borrowings under our Super Senior Facilities to
finance our operations, service our indebtedness and fund capital expenditures. Our ability to make these
payments depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory
and other factors, many of which we cannot control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from
operations in the future, which could result in us being unable to service or repay indebtedness or fund other
liquidity needs. If we cannot service our indebtedness and meet our other obligations and commitments, we
might be required to refinance our debt or dispose of assets to obtain funds for such purpose. We cannot assure
you that such refinancings or asset disposals could be effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all,
or would be permitted by the terms of our debt instruments.

**Despite our high level of indebtedness and restrictive covenants, we and our subsidiaries will still be able**
**to incur significant additional amounts of debt or make certain restricted payments, which could further**
**exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage**

We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including additional secured
indebtedness, in the future. Although the Temporary Indenture, the Indenture and the Super Senior Facilities
Agreement contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of
significant qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness (including
secured indebtedness) that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial.
Following this Offering, we expect to have SEK 640 million immediately available for borrowing under our
Revolving Credit Facility, and SEK 200 million under our Guarantee Facility. Under the Temporary Indenture
and the Indenture, in addition to specified permitted debt, we can incur additional indebtedness so long as on a
pro forma basis our fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Temporary Indenture and Indenture) is at least
2.0 to 1.0 and additional indebtedness sharing in the Collateral securing the Additional Notes so long as on a pro
forma basis our consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio (as calculated in accordance with the “Description
_of the Notes”) is no greater than 4.3x to 1.0. In addition, neither the Temporary Indenture, the Indenture nor the_
agreement governing our Super Senior Facilities prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute
indebtedness under those agreements. Moreover, some of the debt we may incur in the future could be effectively
and structurally senior to the Notes and may be secured by collateral that does not secure the Notes. The
incurrence of additional debt would increase the leverage-related risks described in this offering memorandum. If
we are able to designate some of our restricted subsidiaries under the Temporary Indenture and the Indenture as
unrestricted subsidiaries, those unrestricted subsidiaries would be permitted to borrow beyond the limitations
specified in the Temporary Indenture and the Indenture and engage in other activities in which restricted
subsidiaries may not engage. We are also permitted to invest in joint ventures and acquisitions, which may
increase our indebtedness. Moreover, although the Temporary Indenture, the Indenture and the agreement
governing our Super Senior Facilities contain restrictions on our ability to make restricted payments, including
the declaration and payment of dividends, we are able to make substantial restricted payments under certain
circumstances. Under the Temporary Indenture and the Indenture, for example, we are able to make dividends,
distributions, loans or other payments to any Parent (as defined therein) so long as on a pro forma basis our
specified consolidated total net leverage ratio (as calculated in accordance with the “Description of the Notes”)
does not exceed 3.0 to 1.0 on a net basis. Adding new debt to our and our subsidiaries’ existing debt levels or
making restricted payments could exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage described above,
including our possible inability to service our debt.

**We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, including due to factors outside**
**our control, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness,**
**which may not be successful**

Our ability to service our indebtedness will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by
prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors. Some of these factors are

58


-----

beyond our control. In addition, our ability to borrow funds in the future to make payments on our debt will
depend on the satisfaction of the covenants in our debt agreements, including the Temporary Indenture and the
Indenture, and other agreements we may enter into in the future. We cannot assure you that our business will
generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount
sufficient to enable us to make interest and principal payments on our debt, including the Notes, or to fund our
other liquidity needs.

If our cash flows from operations and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt obligations, we may be
forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital, forego opportunities, or seek to
restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes. These alternative measures may not be successful
and may not be sufficient to enable us to meet our scheduled debt obligations. In the absence of such cash flows
and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be required to sell material assets to
attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those asset sales to
raise capital or sell assets at prices and on terms that we believe are fair, and any proceeds that we receive may
not be adequate to meet any debt obligations then due. If we cannot meet our debt obligations, the holders of our
debt may accelerate our debt and, to the extent such debt is secured, foreclose on our assets securing such debt. In
such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay all of our debt.

In addition, any failure to make payments of interest or principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely
basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional
indebtedness. For a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”_

**We are subject to restrictive debt covenants limit our flexibility in operating our business and our ability**
**to raise additional funds**

The Temporary Indenture, the Indenture and the agreement governing our Super Senior Facilities contain
covenants that significantly restrict our ability to:

Š incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;

Š incur or permit to exist certain liens;

Š make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions, with respect to Capital Stock;

Š prepay or redeem subordinated debt or Capital Stock;

Š make certain loans or other investments;

Š create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or advances to,
and on the transfer of assets to the Issuer or any of its restricted subsidiaries;

Š sell, lease or transfer certain assets, including Capital Stock of restricted subsidiaries;

Š engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

Š issue or sell the share capital of certain subsidiaries;

Š consummate a change of control;

Š consolidate or merge with other entities or sell substantially all of our assets; and

Š impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes.

Each of the covenants is subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—The Super Senior Facilities” and “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—_
_Certain Covenants.” Despite these exceptions and qualifications, the covenants contained in the Temporary_
Indenture, the Indenture and the agreement governing our Super Senior Facilities could materially affect our
ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to react to market conditions, raise additional debt or
equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns, take advantage of potential business
opportunities as they arise or grow in accordance with our strategy. For example, such restrictions could
adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, make strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances,
restructure our organization or finance our capital needs.

Additionally, our Super Senior Facilities Agreement requires us to maintain a senior secured net leverage ratio,
which must not exceed 7.2x to 1.0, tested quarterly, and our ability to meet that financial ratio can be affected by

59


-----

events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. A breach of any of
those covenants or restrictions could result in an event of default under the agreement governing the Super Senior
Facilities, and the relevant lenders, subject to applicable cure periods and other limitations on acceleration or
enforcement, could cancel the availability of the Super Senior Facilities and elect to declare all amounts
outstanding thereunder, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, a default under
the agreement governing the Super Senior Facilities could lead to an event of default and acceleration under
other debt instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, including the Temporary
Indenture and the Indenture. If our creditors, including the lenders under the Super Senior Facilities, accelerate
the payment of those amounts, we cannot assure you that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be
sufficient to repay in full those amounts, and to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries which would be due
and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the Notes, in full or in part. In addition, if we are unable
to repay those amounts, our creditors could proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure repayment of
those amounts.

**The Original Notes and drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear, and the Temporary Notes and**
**the Additional Notes will bear, interest at floating rates that could rise significantly, increasing our costs**
**and reducing our cash flow**

The Original Notes bear, and the Temporary Notes and the Additional Notes will bear, interest at floating rates of
interest per annum equal to EURIBOR and drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at floating
rates of interest per annum equal to STIBOR in relation to cash advances in Swedish krona (or, in relation to cash
advances in euro, EURIBOR, in relation to cash advances in Norwegian kroner, NIBOR, and, in relation to cash
advances in Danish krona, CIBOR, and, in relation to cash advances in any other currency, LIBOR (each with a
zero floor)), as adjusted periodically, plus a spread. In addition, the Temporary Indenture and the Indenture
permit us to incur additional indebtedness, which may bear a floating rate of interest. These interest rates could
rise significantly in the future. To the extent that interest rates or any drawings were to increase significantly our
interest expense would correspondingly increase, reducing our cash flow. Although we may enter into certain
hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will be
available or continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks,
including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements.
Further, there may be a mismatch between the successor rates applied in respect of the Group’s floating rate debt
and the successor rates applied in respect of hedging arrangements thereon, which may render such hedging
arrangements ineffective in managing the Group’s interest rate risks.

**Uncertainty relating to the calculation of EURIBOR or LIBOR or a discontinuance of such rates or any**
**regulatory reform affecting such rates may materially adversely affect the value of and return on our**
**floating rate debt, including the Notes**

Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, a measure of interbank lending rates, regulators and law
enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union are conducting investigations into
whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily EURIBOR or the calculation of
LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate EURIBOR and LIBOR. In addition, LIBOR,
EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” are
the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO
Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as
benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds,
which entered into force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of
administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or
benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. For
example, on July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or
compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021 (the “FCA
Announcement”). The FCA Announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot
and will not be guaranteed after 2021. The potential elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other
benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law
enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or LIBOR is determined, which
could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt
linked to such benchmark. Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may
result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact
on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest.

60


-----

The Temporary Indenture and the Indenture provide a mechanism whereby, if EURIBOR is no longer being
calculated or administered, the Issuer could cause an independent financial advisor to determine an appropriate
successor rate, and make certain adjustments to such rate, including applying a spread thereon to make such
successor rate substantially comparable to EURIBOR, which upon certification by the Issuer to each of the
Temporary Trustee, the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and the Paying Agent will be used to calculate the interest
rate in relation to the Notes without any further action or consent by the Holders or the Trustee or the Temporary
Trustee. This would mean that interest on the Notes would be determined on the basis of a benchmark rate,
together with adjustments, that was not contemplated at the time you purchased the Notes. In addition, due to the
uncertainty concerning the availability of an appropriate successor rate and the involvement of an independent
financial advisor, the Temporary Indenture’s or the Indenture’s successor rate mechanism may not operate as
intended at the relevant time.

Any elimination of the EURIBOR benchmark, or changes in the manner of administration of EURIBOR, could
require an adjustment to the terms and conditions of our floating rate debt. Any such consequence could have a
material adverse effect on the value of and return on any such floating rate debt. If EURIBOR were discontinued
or otherwise unavailable, the rate of interest on our floating rate debt will be determined for the relevant period
by the fallback provisions applicable to such debt.

**Risks Related to the Notes and the Collateral**

**Creditors under the Super Senior Facilities, any credit facility that refinances or replaces the Super Senior**
**Facilities, certain hedging obligations and certain other indebtedness and obligations permitted to be**
**incurred on a priority basis under the Indenture are entitled to be repaid in priority to the Notes**

The Original Notes are, and the Additional Notes will be, guaranteed by the same entities that also guarantee the
Super Senior Facilities. Furthermore, the Original Notes and the Additional Notes and the Notes Guarantees are
or will be secured on a first-priority basis by the same Collateral securing the obligations under the Super Senior
Facilities. In addition, under the terms of the Temporary Indenture and the Indenture, we are permitted to incur
significant additional indebtedness and other obligations that may be secured by the same Collateral on a pari
_passu basis with the Notes and, in certain circumstances, receive proceeds from enforcement of Collateral prior_
to the Notes. The Temporary Indenture and the Indenture permit and the Intercreditor Agreement permits
hedging and certain other indebtedness incurred in accordance with the Temporary Indenture and the Indenture to
be secured on a priority basis.

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the first-priority security interests securing the Additional Notes are
contractually deemed to rank equally with the security interests that secure (but only to the extent that such
security is expressed to secure those liabilities) (i) obligations under the Super Senior Facilities, including
obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Guarantee Facility and the Pension Guarantee Facility,
(ii) certain obligations under hedging arrangements and (iii) certain other future indebtedness and obligations
permitted to be incurred under the Temporary Indenture and the Indenture. Such security interests are, or will be,
evidenced by security documents for the benefit of (whether directly or through the Security Agent) the holders
of the Additional Notes, the lenders under the Super Senior Facilities and/or the holders of certain other future
indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the Temporary Indenture and the Indenture. Under the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, subject to certain conditions, in the event of acceleration of the Super Senior Facilities,
the Additional Notes or other secured obligations, amounts recovered in respect of the Collateral, will be required
to repay indebtedness in respect of the Super Senior Facilities, including obligations under the Revolving Credit
Facility, the Guarantee Facility and the Pension Guarantee Facility, as well as certain Hedging Obligations,
certain future indebtedness and hedging obligations (if any) in priority to the Additional Notes, following the
payment of fees and expenses of the agent under the Super Senior Facilities, the Trustee and the Security Agent
(and any receiver or delegate) and any fees and expenses of any other creditor representative of future
indebtedness permitted under the terms of the Temporary Indenture and the Indenture to benefit from such
security interests. As a result, proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may be insufficient to pay claims
under the Additional Notes. In addition, claims of our secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also
secure the Additional Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the
Additional Notes.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that a common security agent, who will serve as the Security Agent for the
secured parties with respect to the Collateral, will act only as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement. The
Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Collateral unless otherwise instructed by the Instructing Group (as
defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) for the purpose of enforcement. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—Security.”_

61


-----

Creditors under Super Senior Facilities may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the
Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies under the
security documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the Additional Notes to do so.

In addition, if the Security Agent sells the Collateral as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Additional Notes and the Notes Guarantees and the liens over any
other assets of such entities securing such Notes and Notes Guarantees may be released. See “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—Security.”_

**Holders of the Original Notes and the Additional Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the**
**Collateral**

The Original Notes are, and the Additional Notes will be, to the extent permitted under applicable law and
subject to the Agreed Security Principles, secured on a first-ranking basis by substantially the same rights,
property and assets securing the obligations under the Super Senior Facilities, including obligations under the
Revolving Credit Facility, the Guarantee Facility and the Pension Guarantee Facility. In addition, under the terms
of the Temporary Indenture and the Indenture, we are permitted to incur significant additional indebtedness and
other obligations that may be secured by the same Collateral.

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, a common security agent will serve as the Security Agent for the
secured parties under the Super Senior Facilities, the Original Notes, the Additional Notes and the hedging
arrangements (if any), respectively, with regard to the shared Collateral (as applicable). The Intercreditor
Agreement provides that the Security Agent will, subject to certain limited exceptions, act to enforce the security
interests in the Collateral and take instructions from the relevant secured creditors in respect of the Collateral
only at the direction of an “instructing group.”

Generally, if there are conflicting enforcement instructions received by the Security Agent from the different
classes of creditors which are secured by the Collateral and who can constitute either “majority super super
senior creditors” (generally lenders under the Pension Guarantee Facility and any additional Pension Guarantee
Facility whose credit participations represent more than 66 2/3% of the aggregate credit participations of all
Pension Guarantee Facility lenders), “majority super senior creditors” (generally, creditors representing 50.1% of
the aggregate of all unpaid and undrawn commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Guarantee
Facility (or any replacement thereof) and the termination value or assumed termination value of certain future
“super priority” hedging obligations, if any) or “majority senior secured creditors” (generally, creditors
representing the majority of the outstanding principal amount under the Original Notes and the Additional Notes,
any pari passu secured indebtedness and the termination value or assumed termination value of certain future
hedging obligations which are not given “super priority” status, if any), as the case may be, the representatives of
the creditors sharing in the Collateral are required to first consult in good faith with each other (in each case,
including the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Original Notes and the Additional Notes, the agent on behalf
of lenders under the Pension Guarantee Facility (or any replacement thereof) and the agent on behalf of the
lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility (or any replacement thereof) and the Security Agent, for a period of
15 days (or such shorter period as may be agreed) with a view to coordinating the instructions to be given by an
instructing group and agreeing an enforcement strategy (a “joint enforcement strategy”). Upon conclusion of this
“consultation period,” if the relevant creditor representatives are unable to agree on a joint enforcement strategy
or if conflicting enforcement instructions are received by the Security Agent from the different classes of
creditors which are secured by the Collateral and who can constitute an instructing group, and provided that the
“security enforcement principles” set out in the Intercreditor Agreement have been complied with, then the
majority senior secured creditors shall constitute an instructing group and shall have the right to instruct the
Security Agent as to the enforcement of the Collateral.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no consultation period shall be required if either (i) any of the Collateral becomes
enforceable because of an insolvency event in respect of the Issuer, Midco or certain members of the Group,
(ii) the majority super super senior creditors, majority super senior creditors or the majority senior secured
creditors determine in good faith that entering into consultation could reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any of the Collateral or to reduce the amount likely to be
realized upon enforcement of the Collateral to a level such that the obligations to the “super senior creditors”
would not be discharged in full, or (iii) the relevant creditor representatives are in agreement as to any proposed
enforcement action, in which case, the Security Agent shall act in accordance with the instructions provided by
the majority senior secured creditors (provided that such instructions are consistent with the security enforcement
principles set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement).

62


-----

Generally, if the Security Agent is obliged to follow the enforcement instructions of the majority senior secured
creditors as discussed above and either (i) the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility (or any replacement
thereof) (together with any “super priority” hedging obligations) have not been repaid in full in cash within six
months of the end of the consultation period, (ii) the Security Agent has not commenced any enforcement action
(or any transaction in lieu) in respect of the relevant Collateral within three months of the end of the consultation
period or (iii) an insolvency event has occurred in respect of the Issuer or certain members of the Group and the
Security Agent has not commenced enforcement (or any transaction in lieu) of the relevant Collateral or taken
any other enforcement action at that time, then, the Security Agent shall, provided that the security enforcement
principles set out in the Intercreditor Agreement have been complied with, instead follow the instructions that are
given by the majority super senior creditors (and the terms of the relevant previous enforcement instructions of
the majority senior secured creditors which conflict with the instructions of the majority super senior creditors
shall be deemed revoked).

Further, generally, if the Security Agent is obliged to follow the enforcement instructions of the majority super
senior creditors or the majority senior secured creditors as discussed above and either (i) the lenders under the
Pension Guarantee Facility (or any replacement thereof) have not been repaid in full in cash within twelve
months of the end of the consultation period, (ii) the Security Agent has not commenced any enforcement action
(or any transaction in lieu) in respect of the relevant Collateral within nine months of the end of the consultation
period or (iii) an insolvency event has occurred in respect of the Issuer or certain members of the Group and the
Security Agent has not commenced enforcement (or any transaction in lieu) of the relevant Collateral or taken
any other enforcement action at that time, then, the Security Agent shall, provided that the security enforcement
principles set out in the Intercreditor Agreement have been complied with, instead follow the instructions that are
given by the majority super super senior creditors (and the terms of the relevant previous enforcement
instructions of the majority senior secured creditors or majority super senior secured creditors which conflict
with the instructions of the majority super senior creditors shall be deemed revoked).

The foregoing security enforcement arrangements could be disadvantageous to the holders of the Additional
Notes in a number of respects.

Disputes may occur between the holders of the Additional Notes and creditors under our Super Senior Facilities
(under any of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Guarantee Facility and the Pension Guarantee Facility),
counterparties to certain hedging arrangements, if any, and/or holders of any permitted pari passu secured
indebtedness as to the appropriate manner of pursuing enforcement remedies and strategies with respect to the
Collateral securing such obligations. In such an event, the holders of the Additional Notes will be bound by any
decisions of the relevant instructing group, which may result in enforcement action in respect of the relevant
Collateral, whether or not such action is approved by the holders of the Additional Notes or may be adverse to
such holders of Additional Notes. The creditors under the Super Senior Facilities (under any of the Revolving
Credit Facility, the Guarantee Facility and the Pension Guarantee Facility), counterparties to certain hedging
arrangements, if any, or the holders of any permitted pari passu secured indebtedness may have interests that are
different from the interest of holders of the Additional Notes and they may elect to pursue their remedies under
the relevant Security Documents at a time when it would otherwise be disadvantageous for the holders of the
Additional Notes to do so.

Other creditors not party to the Intercreditor Agreement could commence enforcement action against the Issuer
or one or more of the Issuer’s subsidiaries during the consultation period or the Issuer or one or more of the
Issuer’s subsidiaries could seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws, or the value of certain Collateral
could otherwise be impaired or reduced in value. In addition, if we incur substantial additional indebtedness
which may be secured on the Collateral, the holders of the Additional Notes may not comprise the requisite
majority senior secured creditors for the purposes of instructing the Security Agent. Further, if the super senior
creditors have not been repaid in full within six months of the end of the consultation period or in the event of the
occurrence of certain other circumstances described above, then control of the enforcement proceedings will shift
to the majority super senior creditors and if the super super senior creditors have not been repaid in full within
twelve months of the end of the consultation period or in the event of the occurrence of certain other
circumstances described above, then control of the enforcement proceedings will shift to the majority super super
senior creditors.

The holders of the Additional Notes will also have no separate right to enforce the Collateral securing the
Additional Notes. In addition, the holders of the Additional Notes will not be able to instruct the Security Agent,
force a sale of Collateral or otherwise independently pursue the remedies of a secured creditor under the relevant
Security Documents, unless they comprise an instructing group which is entitled to give such instructions, which,
in turn, will depend on certain conditions and circumstances including those described above.

63


-----

In addition, if the Security Agent sells any of the Collateral as a result of an enforcement action in accordance
with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Additional Notes and over any other assets securing the
Additional Notes may be released. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—Security—Release of Liens.”_

**The Collateral may not be sufficient to secure the obligations under the Additional Notes**

The Original Notes, the Additional Notes and the Notes Guarantees are or will be secured by first-priority
security interests in the Collateral described in this offering memorandum, which Collateral also secures the
obligations under the Super Senior Facilities, certain hedging obligations and may secure certain future
obligations. The Revolving Credit Facility is part of the Super Senior Facilities which also include a SEK
200 million Guarantee Facility and a SEK 240 million Pension Guarantee Facility. We may increase the amounts
available under Super Senior Facilities or incur additional super senior liabilities as a result of which the amount
of indebtedness and obligations that will benefit from “super priority” first-priority security interests in the
Collateral may be increased up to the amount permitted under the Temporary Indenture and the Indenture. The
Temporary Indenture and the Indenture do not prohibit any increases to the amount of the Pension Guarantee
Facility secured on the Collateral nor provide any cap in respect of such amount. For example, we have been
required to increase the amount of our current SEK 240 million bank guarantee incurred under the Pension
Guarantee Facility by SEK 45 million. Although we have initially incurred this additional amount of SEK
45 million under the Guarantee Facility, we expect to ultimately incur the full SEK 285 million under the
Pension Guarantee Facility once we have increased the SEK 240 million of aggregate commitments thereunder
by SEK 45 million, as permitted under the terms of the Pension Guarantee Facility Agreement to reflect
increased guarantee requirements by the pension administrator (and to cancel the amount initially incurred under
the Guarantee Facility). Thus any amount of Pension Guarantee Facility (or replacement facility utilized for the
same purposes) will be secured in priority to the Additional Notes. The Collateral may also secure additional debt
ranking pari passu with the Additional Notes to the extent permitted by the terms of the Temporary Indenture, the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The rights of the holders of the Additional Notes to the Collateral
may therefore be diluted by any increase in the debt secured by first-priority liens on the Collateral.

If there is an event of default on the Additional Notes, the holders of the Additional Notes will be secured only
by the Collateral. There is no guarantee that the value of the Collateral will be sufficient to enable the Issuer to
satisfy its obligations under the Additional Notes. The proceeds of any sale of the Collateral following an event
of default with respect to the Additional Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy, and may be substantially less
than, amounts due on the Additional Notes.

The value of the Collateral is based on certain assumptions. The fair market value of the Collateral at any point in
time may be subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, general economic conditions,
industry conditions and similar factors. The amount to be received upon an enforcement of such Collateral will
depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, the
condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers, whether or not our
business is sold as a going concern, the ability to readily liquidate the Collateral and the fair market value and
condition of the Collateral. Furthermore, there may not be any buyer willing and able to purchase our business as
a going concern, or willing to buy a significant portion of our assets in the event of an enforcement action. As a
result, the book value of the Collateral should not be conclusively relied on as a measure of realizable value for
such assets following the occurrence of an event of default or enforcement event under the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Indenture or the Super Senior Facilities. All or a portion of the Collateral may be illiquid and
may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, we cannot assure you that there will be a market for
the sale of the Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in our liquidation. In
addition, the security granted over the shares of an entity may be of no value if that entity is subject to an
insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding.

To the extent that liens, security interests and other rights granted to other parties encumber assets owned by the
Issuer or the Guarantors, those parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property
subject to their liens, security interests or other rights that could adversely affect the value of that Collateral and
the ability of the Security Agent, the Trustee or investors as holders of the Additional Notes to realize or enforce
that Collateral. If the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the
Additional Notes and the Notes Guarantees, investors (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of
the Collateral) would have only an unsecured claim (if the relevant guarantee has not been released) against the
Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ remaining assets. Each of these factors or any challenge to the validity of the
Collateral or the intercreditor arrangement governing our creditors’ rights could reduce the proceeds realized
upon enforcement of the Collateral.

64


-----

In addition, the Collateral may not be liquid, and its value to other parties may be less than its value to us.
Likewise, we cannot assure you that there will be a market for the pledged shares or other Collateral or, if such
market does exist, that there will not be substantial delays in their liquidation. In addition, the value of this
Collateral may fluctuate over time.

**The Collateral secures amounts under certain guarantee facilities which are more likely to become due in**
**circumstances when an enforcement action may be taken**

The Super Senior Facilities comprise the Revolving Credit Facility, the Guarantee Facility and the Pension
Guarantee Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized by the drawing of cash advances, the issue of
bank guarantees and documentary credits (including letters of credit and performance bonds) and by way of
ancillary facilities. The Guarantee Facility may be utilized by the issue of letters of credits, bank guarantees and
by way of ancillary facilities by way of guarantee facilities and the Pension Guarantee Facility may be utilized by
the issue of bank guarantees and by way of ancillary facilities by way of pension guarantee facilities. The
Pension Guarantee Facility is intended to provide a guarantee required by the Swedish pension regulatory
authorities in respect of the Group’s defined benefit pensions obligations.

In the ordinary course of business, amounts under the Guarantee Facility and the Pension Guarantee Facility are
likely to operate in a contingent manner rather than requiring immediate repayment. However, in the types of
circumstances where the Collateral may become enforceable, including upon a payment default or insolvency
related default under the Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility, the Guarantee Facility or the Pension Guarantee
Facility, these contingent claims are more likely to crystallize. This may occur, for instance, if contractual parties
that have been provided guarantees under project contracts will call on their guarantees. This will mean that
amounts under such facilities will become due and payable, and as discussed above, will recover the proceeds of
Collateral in priority to the Additional Notes.

As described above, if the Super Senior Facilities are not repaid in full in prescribed amounts of time as set forth
in the Intercreditor Agreement, creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and Guarantee Facility as super
senior creditors and / or creditors under the Pension Guarantee Facility as super super senior creditors will
become the instructing group for enforcement of the security.

**The Additional Notes will not be initially secured by all of the Collateral**

Upon the Temporary Notes Exchange, the Additional Notes will not be secured by all of the Collateral, as further
described under “Description of the Notes—Security.” Upon the Temporary Notes Exchange, the Additional
Notes will be secured by the Completion Date Collateral. Within 60 business days of the Completion Date, the
Additional Notes will be secured by the Post-Completion Date Collateral. The security interests will be limited to
the same extent as those under the Super Senior Facilities and otherwise as set forth under “Certain Insolvency
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security_
_Interests,” which limitations could be significant. It should be noted that if a guarantee or a security interest_
granted by a Guarantor in certain jurisdictions is granted or perfected after the secured obligation arose, such
guarantee or security interest may be subject to claw-back provisions under applicable local insolvency laws.

**It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Additional Notes**

The Collateral securing the Additional Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances,
liens and other imperfections permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement and accepted by
other creditors that have the benefit of security interests in the Collateral from time to time. The existence of any
such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the
Collateral securing the Additional Notes, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on
such Collateral. Furthermore, the first-priority ranking of security interests with respect to the Additional Notes
can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection
requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions.

The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the
realization of security interests in the Collateral. For example, the enforcement of share pledges, whether by
means of a public auction or a private sale, may be subject to certain specific requirements and the Security
Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third-party to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that
the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any
third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security

65


-----

Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly
decrease. See “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes
_Guarantees and the Security Interests” for further information._

**The granting of the security interests in connection with the issuance of the Additional Notes, or the**
**incurrence of permitted debt or other obligations in the future, may create or restart hardening periods**

The granting of security interests to secure the Additional Notes and the Notes Guarantees may create hardening
periods for such security interests. The granting of shared security interests to secure future indebtedness or other
obligations permitted to be secured on the Collateral may restart or reopen such hardening periods in particular,
because the Indenture permits the release and retaking of security granted in favor of the Additional Notes in
certain circumstances, including in connection with the incurrence of future indebtedness. The applicable
hardening period for these new security interests can run from the moment each new security interest has been
granted, perfected or recreated. Each time, if the security interest granted, perfected or recreated were to be
enforced before the end of the respective hardening period, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may
not be possible to enforce it. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the
Additional Notes would lose the benefit of the security interest.

The same rights and risks also will apply with respect to future security interests granted in connection with the
accession of further subsidiaries as additional Guarantors and the granting of security interests over their relevant
assets and equity interests for the benefit of holders of the Additional Notes. See “Certain Insolvency
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security_
_Interests.”_

**Your rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the**
**Collateral**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected, and its priority retained,
through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor, as applicable, of the security. The
liens on the Collateral securing the Additional Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the
Additional Notes if we fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens.

Absent perfection, the holder of the security interest may have difficulty enforcing such holder’s rights in the
Collateral with regard to third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security
interest in the same Collateral and some security interests do not actually create the purported security interest if
not properly perfected. In addition, a debtor may discharge its obligation by paying the security provider until,
but not after, the debtor receives a notification of the existence of the security interest granted by the security
provider in favor of the security taken over the claims the security taker (as creditor) has against the debtor.
Finally, since the ranking of pledges is sometimes determined by the date on which they became enforceable
against third parties, a security interest created on a later date over the same Collateral, but which came into force
for third parties earlier (by way of registration in the appropriate register or by notification) may have priority.
Neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent has any obligation or responsibility to monitor the acquisition of
additional property or rights that constitute collateral or the perfection of, or to take steps or actions to perfect or
ensure the perfection of, any security interest in the Additional Notes against third parties. See “Certain
_Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the_
_Security Interests” for further information._

**The security interests in the Collateral have been or will be, as applicable, granted to the Security Agent**
**(on behalf of the holders of the Additional Notes) rather than directly to the holders of the Additional**
**Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted by local law**

The security interests in the Collateral that secure, or will secure, the obligations of the Issuer under the
Additional Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under the Notes Guarantees have not been and will not be
granted directly to the holders of the relevant Additional Notes but have been or will be granted only in favor of
the Security Agent, which will hold the Collateral on behalf of the lenders under the Super Senior Facilities and
our hedging obligations, the holders of the Additional Notes and the holders of any additional debt secured by
Collateral permitted to be incurred under the Temporary Indenture and the Indenture. The Indenture provides
(along with the Intercreditor Agreement) that only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the Security
Documents. As a consequence, holders of the Additional Notes will not have direct security interests and will not
be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Additional Notes, except through

66


-----

the Trustee, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent in
respect of the Collateral. See “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests” for further information._

It is generally possible under Swedish law to grant security interests in favor of an agent acting on behalf of
secured parties. However, to enable the Security Agent to enforce the security interests in the Collateral on behalf
of the holders of the Additional Notes in a Swedish court, the Security Agent may need a specific power of
attorney from each holder of the Additional Notes. It has not been established by judicial precedent or otherwise
by law that a power of attorney or mandate of agency, including the appointment of an agent can be made
irrevocable. Therefore, any powers of attorney or mandates of agency can be revoked and will terminate by
operation of law and without notice at the bankruptcy or temporal demise of the party giving such powers. In
addition, the failure of all holders of the Additional Notes to submit such a power of attorney could negatively
affect the enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral.

**The Issuer and the Guarantors will have control over the Collateral securing the Additional Notes, and the**
**sale of particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Additional Notes**

The Security Documents will allow the Issuer and the Guarantors to remain in possession of, retain exclusive
control over, freely operate and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the Collateral securing the
Additional Notes. So long as no default or event of default under the Indenture would result therefrom, the Issuer
and the Guarantors may, among other things, without any release or consent by the Security Agent, conduct
ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise
disposing of the Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of indebtedness.

**There are circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of Additional Notes under which the**
**Collateral securing the Additional Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be released automatically and**
**under which the Notes Guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of**
**the Trustee**

Under various circumstances, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Additional Notes will be
released automatically. See “Description of the Notes—Notes Guarantees” and “Description of the Notes—
_Security—Release of Liens.” In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral comprising the shares of any of_
our subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, then claims
under the Additional Notes and the Notes Guarantees may be released or transferred. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—Security—Release of_
_Liens.” Your ability to recover on the Additional Notes could be materially impaired in such circumstances._

The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that the Collateral securing the Additional Notes may be released and
retaken in connection with the refinancing of certain indebtedness, including the Additional Notes. Such a release
and retaking of Collateral may give rise to the start of a new “hardening period” in respect of such Collateral.
Under certain circumstances, other creditors, insolvency administrators or representatives or courts could
challenge the validity and enforceability of the grant of such Collateral. Any such challenge, if successful, could
potentially limit your recovery in respect of such Collateral and thus reduce your recovery under the Additional
Notes. See also “—The granting of the security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the
_incurrence of permitted debt or other obligations in the future, may create or restart hardening periods.”_

**The Issuer does not have revenue generating operations of its own and will depend on cash flows from**
**operating companies to make payments on the Notes**

The Issuer does not have any revenue-generating activities of its own and does not have any business operations,
material assets (other than its shareholding in Assemblin Holding AB). Repayment of the Issuer’s indebtedness,
including under the Notes, is dependent on the profitability and cash flow of its subsidiaries and their ability to
make such cash available to the Issuer, by dividend distributions, or otherwise. The subsidiaries of the Issuer may
not be able to, or may be restricted by the terms of their existing or future indebtedness, or by law, in their ability
to make distributions or advance upstream loans to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness,
including the Notes. Each of the subsidiaries of the Issuer is a distinct legal entity and, under certain
circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from the subsidiaries of the
Issuer. Furthermore, goodwill impairment and other non-cash charges in our profit or loss account, as well as
charges recognized directly in equity, if incurred, could reduce the Issuer’s subsidiaries’ reserves available for
distribution and thus reduce or prevent upstream dividend payments to the Issuer.

-----

While the Temporary Indenture, the Indenture and the Super Senior Facilities, respectively, limit the ability of
the Group’s subsidiaries to incur contractual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other
intercompany payments to us, such limitations are subject to certain significant qualifications and exceptions. In
the event that we do not receive distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make
required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, including the Notes. We do not expect to have any
other sources of funds that would allow us to make payments to holders of the Notes.

**The Temporary Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of all of our subsidiaries, and the**
**Additional Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-Guarantor members of our**
**Group**

The Temporary Notes will not benefit from any guarantees, which means that holders of the Temporary Notes
will have no direct claims against the assets or the earnings of the Group (other than the Issuer) to satisfy
obligations due under the Temporary Notes. Upon the Temporary Notes Exchange, some, but not all, of the
members of the Group will guarantee the Additional Notes. As of and for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2020, the Guarantors represented 90% of our net revenues, 88% of our EBITDA and over 100%
of our assets (other than goodwill and shares in subsidiaries), in each case, calculated on a stand-alone basis
without giving effect to intergroup eliminations. On an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions as
of September 30, 2020, the subsidiaries of the Issuer that will not guarantee the Additional Notes would have had
less than SEK 10 million outstanding financial indebtedness.

Unless a member of our Group is a Guarantor, such member will not have any obligations to pay amounts due
under the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose. The Indenture, subject to some limitations, permits
our non-Guarantor restricted subsidiaries to incur substantial amounts of additional indebtedness and does not
restrict the amount of other liabilities that may be incurred by these subsidiaries. Generally, holders of
indebtedness of, and trade creditors of, non-guarantor companies, including lenders under bank financing
agreements, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such non-Guarantor companies before
these assets are made available for distribution to the Issuer or any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder.

Accordingly, in the event that any non-Guarantor company becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or
dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction:

Š the creditors of the Issuer (including the holders of the Notes) and the Guarantors will have no right to
proceed against the assets of such company; and

Š the creditors of such non-guarantor company, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to payment
in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such company before any Guarantor, as a direct or
indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary.

As such, the Temporary Notes, the Additional Notes and each Notes Guarantee will be structurally subordinated
to the creditors (including trade creditors) and any preferred stockholders of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries.

**The Notes Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Additional Notes will be subject to certain**
**limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may**
**limit their validity and enforceability**

The Additional Notes will be guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries which are incorporated under the laws of
Sweden and Norway and will be secured by security interests over the Collateral, which will be governed by the
laws of these jurisdictions and Finland. The Indenture provides that the Notes Guarantees, and the Indenture and
the relevant Security Documents provide or will provide that the security interests, will be limited to the
maximum amount that can be guaranteed, or otherwise, or in respect of which security interests may be granted,
by the relevant Guarantor or grantor, as applicable, without rendering the relevant Notes Guarantee or security
interest, as it relates to that Guarantor or grantor, voidable or otherwise ineffective or limited under applicable
law. See “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes
_Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

In addition, enforcement of any of the Notes Guarantees against any Guarantor or security interests against any
security provider will be subject to certain defenses available to Guarantors or security providers, as applicable,
in the relevant jurisdiction. Although laws differ among these jurisdictions, these laws and defenses generally
include those that relate to corporate purpose or benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference,

68


-----

insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, financial assistance, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization,
capital maintenance, set-off, counter-claim and prescription (time bar) or similar laws, regulations or defenses
affecting the rights of creditors generally. If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, a Guarantor
or grantor of security interests may have no liability or decreased liability under its Notes Guarantee or security
interest, as applicable, depending on the amount of its other obligations and applicable law.

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other laws,
a court could (i) subordinate or void any Notes Guarantee or any security interest (ii) direct that the holders of the
Additional Notes return any amounts paid under a Notes Guarantee or security interest to the relevant Guarantor
or security provider, or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors or (iii) take other action that is
detrimental to you, typically if the court found that:

Š the Notes Guarantee or security interest was granted with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors
or shareholders of the Guarantor or the security provider or, in certain jurisdictions, even when the recipient
was merely aware that the Guarantor or the security provider was insolvent when it granted the relevant
Notes Guarantee or security;

Š the Guarantor or security provider did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for the
granting of the Notes Guarantee and/or security interest and the Guarantor or security provider: (i) was
insolvent or was rendered insolvent as a result of having granted the relevant Notes Guarantee or security
interest; (ii) was under-capitalized or became under-capitalized because of the relevant Notes Guarantee or
security interest; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to
pay at maturity;

Š the granting of the relevant Notes Guarantee and/or security interest was held to constitute prohibited
financial assistance;

Š the granting of the relevant Notes Guarantee and/or security interest was held not to be in the best interests
or not to be for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor or security provider or was held to exceed the
corporate objects of the Guarantor or security provider; or

Š the aggregate amounts paid or payable under the relevant Notes Guarantee or enforcement proceeds under
the relevant security were in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law.

These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee granted by any of our subsidiaries pursuant to the
Indenture.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon applicable governing
law. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if:

Š the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all its assets;

Š the present fair value of its assets was less than the amount required to pay its existing debts and liabilities,
including contingent liabilities, as they became due; or

Š it could not pay its debts as they became due.

We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was “insolvent” at
the relevant time or that, regardless of the method of the valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor
was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was
insolvent on the date its Notes Guarantee was issued, that payments to holders of the Additional Notes
constituted preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds.

The liability of each Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee, or security provider under the relevant Security
Document, will be limited to the amount that will result in such Notes Guarantee or security interest not
constituting a fraudulent preference or conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set
aside. However, there can be no assurances as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of
the maximum liability of each Guarantor or security provider. There is a possibility that the entire Notes
Guarantee or security interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished.

If a court were to find that the issuance of the Additional Notes or a Notes Guarantee, or the granting of the
security, was a fraudulent preference or conveyance or unenforceable for any other reason, the court could hold
that the payment obligations under the Additional Notes or such Notes Guarantee or Security Document are
ineffective, could void the security over the Collateral, or could require the holders of the relevant Additional

69


-----

Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the Additional Notes or such Notes Guarantee or any
enforcement proceeds received from enforcement of the security. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent
preference or conveyance occurred, you may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor or
security provider and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer, any other Guarantor or security provider, if
applicable, under any Notes Guarantees or Security Documents that have not been declared void.

Additionally, any future pledge or charge of Collateral in favor of the Security Agent, including pursuant to
Security Documents delivered after the date of the Indenture, might be avoidable by the security provider (as
debtor-in-possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy (or similar officer) if certain events or circumstances exist or
occur, including, among others, if the security provider is insolvent at the time of the pledge or charge, the pledge
or charge permits the holders of the Additional Notes to receive a greater recovery than if the pledge or charge
had not been given and a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the security provider is commenced within a
certain time period following the pledge or charge.

**Enforcement of the rights of the holders of the Notes under the Temporary Indenture and the Indenture**
**across multiple jurisdictions may be difficult and the applicable insolvency laws may preclude holders of**
**the Notes from recovering payments due on the Notes**

The Temporary Indenture, the Indenture, the Notes and the Notes Guarantees are or will be governed by the laws
of the State of New York, the Intercreditor Agreement is governed by the laws of England and Wales, and the
Security Documents granting security interests in the Collateral are or will be governed by the laws of a number
of different jurisdictions. Moreover, the Issuer and the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Sweden and
Norway and a third party security provider is located in Luxembourg. Therefore, in the event of bankruptcy,
insolvency or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in these and other applicable jurisdictions. The
rights of the holders of the Notes under the Temporary Indenture or the Indenture, as applicable, will thus be
subject to the laws of a number of jurisdictions, and it may be difficult to effectively enforce such rights in
multiple bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar proceedings. Moreover, such multi-jurisdictional proceedings
are typically complex and costly for creditors and often result in substantial uncertainty and delay in the
enforcement of creditors’ rights. In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administration and other laws of the
jurisdiction of incorporation of the Issuer and the Guarantors may be materially different from, or in conflict
with, one another, including creditors’ rights, priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and
the duration of the insolvency proceeding. The application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could
trigger disputes over which jurisdictions’ law should apply and could adversely affect the ability to realize any
recovery under the Notes.

**Our hedging agreements may expose us to credit default risks and potential losses if our hedging**
**counterparties fall into bankruptcy**

We are party to certain interest rate swaps and we may enter into additional interest hedging agreements to hedge
our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, primarily under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes. Under
any such agreements, we are exposed to credit risks of our counterparties. If one or more of our counterparties
falls into bankruptcy, claims we have under the swap agreements or other hedging arrangements may become
worthless. Also, such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse
financial impact resulting from interest rate or foreign currency fluctuations. In addition, in the event that we
refinance our debt or otherwise terminate hedging agreements, we may be required to make termination
payments, which would result in a loss.

**We may not be able to obtain the funds required to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control and**
**the occurrence of certain important corporate events will not constitute a Change of Control**

The Temporary Indenture and the Indenture contain provisions relating to certain events constituting a “Change
of Control” (as defined in the Temporary Indenture and the Indenture, as applicable). Upon the occurrence of a
Change of Control, we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a price equal to 101% of
their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of repurchase.
If a Change of Control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such
time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding
Notes or that the restrictions in the Super Senior Facilities, the Temporary Indenture, the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement or our other than existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required
repurchases. A Change of Control may trigger a mandatory prepayment of the Super Senior Facilities and other
indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such

70


-----

indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from its
subsidiaries to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control,
may be limited by our then existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to
make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a Change of Control were to occur at a time when our
Group is prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek
the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the
borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer
would remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require third-party
financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control. We cannot assure you that our
Group would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would
constitute a default under the Temporary Indenture or the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default
under the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.”

The Change of Control provision contained in the Temporary Indenture and the Indenture may not necessarily
afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring,
merger or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events
may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a Change
of Control as defined in the Temporary Indenture and the Indenture. Except as described under “Description of
_the Notes—Change of Control,” the Temporary Indenture and the Indenture will not contain provisions that_
would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring,
merger, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The definition of Change of Control in the Temporary Indenture and the Indenture will include a disposition of
all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries (if any), taken as a whole, to any
person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no
precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there
may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or
substantially all” of the Issuer’s assets and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be
unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to
repurchase the relevant Notes.

**The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the**
**relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies**

Owners of the book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of relevant Notes unless and until
definitive notes are issued in exchange for book-entry interests. Instead, the common depositary (or its nominee)
for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the Notes in global form.

Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the Notes in global form will be
made to the Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, such payments
will be credited to Euroclear and Clearstream participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the Notes in
global form and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to Euroclear and
Clearstream, none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, Transfer Agent, Paying Agent, the Calculation
Agent or the Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or
payments of interest, principal or other amounts to Euroclear and Clearstream, or to owners of book-entry
interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest in the Notes, you must rely on the procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream and, if you are not a participant in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, on the procedures of
the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the
Notes under the Temporary Indenture and the Indenture.

Owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon our solicitations for consents or requests for
waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes, including the enforcement of security for the Notes and the
Notes Guarantees. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be reliant on the common depositary (or its
nominee) (as registered holder of the Notes) to act on your instructions and/or will be permitted to act directly only
to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream or, if applicable, from
a participant. We cannot assure you that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient
to enable you to vote on any requested actions or to take any other action on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Temporary Indenture and the Indenture, unless
and until the relevant Definitive Registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a
book-entry interest, you will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. We cannot assure you

71


-----

that the procedures to be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely
exercise of rights under the Notes. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.”

**There may not be an active trading market for the Temporary Notes or the Additional Notes, in which**
**case your ability to sell the Temporary Notes or the Additional Notes may be limited**

We cannot assure you as to:

Š the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

Š your ability to sell your Notes; or

Š the price at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing
interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for
non-investment-grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the
prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected
by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in
prices. The trading market for the Notes may attract different investors and this may affect the extent to which
the Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such
disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial
performance. As a result, there can be no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Notes. If no
active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all.

Although the Original Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and an application will be made to the
Authority for the listing of and permission to deal in the Temporary Notes and the Additional Notes on the
Official List of the Exchange, we cannot assure you that the Notes will become or remain listed, as applicable.
Although no assurance can be made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of the admission to the Official
List of the Exchange, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting (whether or not for an alternative
admission to listing on another stock exchange) of the Notes from the Official List of the Exchange may have a
material effect on a holder’s ability to resell the Notes in the secondary market.

In addition, the Indenture allows us to issue additional Notes in the future, which could adversely impact the
liquidity of the relevant Notes.

**United States civil liabilities may not be enforceable against us**

The Issuer and the Guarantors are located in Sweden and Norway and all of our assets are located outside the
United States. In addition, all of the members of our board and our officers reside outside the United States. As a
result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us or such other
persons residing outside the United States, or to enforce outside the United States judgments obtained against
such persons in United States courts in any action. In addition, it may be difficult for investors to enforce, in
original actions brought in courts in jurisdictions located outside the United States, rights predicated upon United
States laws. See “Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.”

Sweden and Norway currently do not have a treaty with the United States providing for the reciprocal recognition
and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. This may give
rise to difficulties in respect of the enforcement in Sweden and Norway of judgments obtained in the United
States. In particular, a judgment entered against a company incorporated in Sweden in the courts of a state which
is not a Member State (as defined in the Recast Brussels Regulation) or a Contracting State (as defined in the
Lugano Convention), such as the United States, would not be recognized or enforceable in Sweden as a matter of
law without a retrial. In addition, a Swedish court may choose to retry the dispute without regard to the previous
judgment. See “Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.”

Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject to
revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time.

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The credit ratings address
our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks in determining the likelihood
that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all
risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed above and other factors that may affect the

72


-----

value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to
revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit
rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn
entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension,
reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the relevant Notes by one or more of the
credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost, terms and conditions of our financings, and could adversely
affect the value and trading of the Notes.

**Certain covenants may be suspended upon the occurrence of a change in our ratings**

The Temporary Indenture and the Indenture provide that, if at any time following the date of the Temporary
Indenture and the Indenture, the Notes receive a rating of “Baa3” or better from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.
(“Moody’s”) or “BBB-” or better from Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (“S&P”) or Fitch Ratings Inc.
(“Fitch”) and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, then beginning that day and
continuing until such time that the Notes receive a rating of below “Baa3” from Moody’s or “BBB-” from S&P
or Fitch, certain covenants will cease to be applicable to the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Certain
_Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status.” If these covenants were to_
cease to be applicable, we would be able to incur additional indebtedness or make payments, including dividends
or investments, which may conflict with the interests of holders of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the
Notes will ever achieve an investment grade rating or that any such rating will be maintained.

**The transferability of the Notes may be limited under applicable securities laws, which may affect their**
**liquidity and the price at which they may be sold**

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or the
securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the
United States, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and the applicable securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction. The
Notes are not being offered for sale in the United States except to QIBs in accordance with Rule 144A. In
addition, by acceptance of delivery of any Notes, the holder thereof agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any
investor accounts for which it has purchased the Notes that it shall not transfer the Notes in an aggregate
principal account of less than €100,000. We have not agreed to or otherwise undertaken to register the Notes with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (including by way of an exchange offer). See “Transfer
_Restrictions.” It is the obligation of holders of the Notes to ensure that their offers and sales of the Notes within_
the United States and other countries comply with applicable securities laws.

**Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes**

The Original Notes are, and the Temporary Notes and the Additional Notes will be, denominated and payable in
euro. If investors measure their investment returns by reference to a currency other than euro, an investment in
the Notes will entail foreign exchange-related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in
the value of the euro relative to the currency by reference to which such investors measure the return on their
investments. These changes may be due to economic, political and other factors over which we have no control.
Depreciation of the euro against the currency by reference to which such investors measure the return on their
investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could
result in a loss to investors when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which
such investors measure the return on their investments.

**Risks Related to Our Ownership**

**The interests of our principal shareholders may conflict with your interests as a holder of the Notes**

The interests of our controlling shareholders may conflict with yours as a holder of the Notes, particularly if we
encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. The controlling shareholders have (directly
or indirectly) the power to, among other things, affect our legal and capital structure and our day-to-day operations
and may have an incentive to increase the value of their investments or cause us to distribute funds at the expense of
our financial condition, which could impact our ability to make payments on the Notes. In addition, the controlling
shareholders have the power to elect a majority of our board of directors and appoint new officers and management
and, therefore, effectively control many other major decisions regarding our operations. We cannot assure you that
the interests of the controlling shareholders will not conflict with your interests as a holder of the Notes. See
“Principal Shareholder” and “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.”

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

**Sources and Uses**

Pending the consummation of the Fidelix Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers will, concurrently with the issuance
of the Temporary Notes on the Issue Date, deposit with the Escrow Agent an amount equal to the gross proceeds
of the Offering sold on the Issue Date into the Escrow Account.

On or about the Completion Date, we expect to use the gross proceeds of the Offering, together with the proceeds
from the Sponsor Investment, to (a) finance the cash consideration payable to the Sellers in connection with the
Fidelix Acquisition (including the purchase price, certain other purchase price adjustments under the Fidelix
Acquisition Agreement and the repayment of certain debt of the Target), (b) pay transaction costs associated with
the Transactions and (c) fund cash on balance sheet, including potential acquisitions.

The following table shows the estimated sources and uses of funds related to the Transactions. Actual amounts
may vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including, but not limited to, differences in fees
and expenses, the timing of the closing of the Fidelix Acquisition, certain purchase price adjustments and
currency exchange rates.

The euro and SEK equivalent amounts are based on a Bloomberg exchange rate of €1.00 to SEK 10.4933 as of
September 30, 2020.

Notes:
(1) As adjusted cash and cash equivalents includes the effect of our estimated total cash consideration payable for the Fidelix Acquisition
(including the repayment of certain existing Target debt and certain other estimated purchase price adjustments under the Fidelix
Acquisition Agreement). The actual amount paid as consideration in the Fidelix Acquisition is subject to adjustment in accordance with
the terms of the Fidelix Acquisition Agreement and may differ.
As adjusted cash and cash equivalents also gives effect to the cash payment of SEK 310 million in connection with certain acquisitions
that have closed between October 1, 2020 and January 15, 2021 which are given pro forma effect as an Acquisition adjustment to Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA (see footnote (g) under “Summary—Operating Data and Non-IFRS Financial Information”).
As adjusted cash and cash equivalents does not give effect to (i) the additional variable cash consideration of up to approximately
SEK 160 million payable over the next three years in respect of acquisitions that have closed through January 15, 2021, and which are
given pro forma effect as an Acquisition adjustment to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (see footnote (g) under “Summary—Operating
_Data and Non-IFRS Financial Information”), and (ii) the expected cash generation post September 30, 2020._
(2) We currently expect no amounts to be drawn in cash on the Issue Date under the Super Senior Facilities; however, certain letters of credit
and/or guarantees will be outstanding and as part of the Transactions, the revolving commitments under the Revolving Credit and
Guarantee Facilities Agreement will be upsized by SEK 190 million.
(3) Represents the total aggregate principal amount of the Temporary Notes. The SEK equivalent amount is based on the Bloomberg
exchange rate of €1.00 to SEK 10.4933 as of September 30, 2020.
(4) Represents the total aggregate principal amount of the Original Notes. See Note 23 to the Audited Combined Financial Statements.
(5) Lease liabilities and total financial liabilities as of September 30, 2020 reflect the impact of adoption of IFRS 16. See “Summary—
_Operating Data and Non-IFRS Financial Information” for presentation of certain financial information on a basis that excludes the_
impact of adoption of IFRS 16.
(6) Other debt includes other long-term debt and mark-to-market changes in the value of derivative instruments used to hedge the Original
Notes.
(7) The total equity of the Issuer on a standalone basis is SEK 4,019 million. The reason for the difference from the consolidated total equity
is due to a previous corporate reorganization that was accounted for as a combination involving entities under common control that
resulted in a negative adjustment to total equity due to the purchase price for the shares of the predecessor entity (given that the
predecessor value method of accounting for such transactions does not allow for the recording of goodwill asset resulting from such
transaction).

**SELECTED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

The following selected combined financial information of Group as of and for the years ended December 31,
2019, 2018, and 2017 have been derived from the Audited Combined Financial Statements included elsewhere in
this offering memorandum.

The following selected condensed financial information of the Group as of and for the nine months ended
September 30, 2020 and 2019, have been derived from the Unaudited Condensed Interim Financial Statements
included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

The Financial Statements have been prepared as combined financial statements. The combined financial
information has been prepared as combined financial statements in a way of illustrating financial information for
a group of entities that are not a legal group but are ultimately owned by the same party. The combined financial
information represents the group of entities that became the legal Assemblin Financing Group at the end of 2019.

From January 1, 2019, we apply IFRS 16 Leases which has an impact on our reported statements of profit or loss,
financial position and presentation of cash flow. In implementing IFRS 16, we selected the modified
retrospective approach as the transition method. As a result, the Unaudited Condensed Interim Financial
Statements and the 2019 financial information contained in the Audited Combined Financial Statements are
prepared after implementing IFRS 16, and the 2018 and 2017 financial information contained in the Audited
Combined Financial Statements is prepared prior to the implementation of IFRS 16. The comparison figures for
2018 and earlier periods have not been restated, and are thus not directly comparable where there are differences
caused by the implementation of IFRS 16. See Note 1 to the Audited Combined Financial Statements.

The unaudited condensed statement of comprehensive income information and the other financial information
presented for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 have been derived by subtracting from the financial
information of the audited combined financial statements as of December 31, 2019 the comparative financial
information of the unaudited condensed interim financial statements for the nine months ended September 30,
2019, and adding the financial information of the unaudited condensed interim financial statements for the nine
months ended September 30, 2020.

The unaudited condensed statement of comprehensive income information and the other financial information
presented for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 have been prepared for illustrative purposes only and
are not necessarily representative of our results of operations for any future period or our financial condition at
any future date. In particular, the unaudited financial information for the twelve-month period ended
September 30, 2020 is not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ended
December 31, 2020 and should not be used as the basis for or prediction of an annualized calculation. This data
has been prepared solely for the purpose of this offering memorandum, is not prepared in the ordinary course of
our financial reporting.

The Group’s combined financial information and other data should be read in conjunction with the information
contained in “Use _of_ _Proceeds,”_ “Capitalization,” “Selected _Consolidated_ _and_ _Combined_ _Financial_
_Information,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and_
the Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

_September 30, 2020 and 2019 and the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 should be read in_
_conjunction with the Financial Statements, the notes thereto, “Presentation of Financial and Other Information”_
_and the other information included elsewhere in this offering memorandum._

_This section contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our results may differ_
_materially from those discussed in such forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those_

primary activities focusing on electrical engineering, heating and sanitation, ventilation and automation, as well
as key competencies in data and telecom, industrial pipes, district heating, cooling, sprinklers, security and
electrical workshop and field services. We hold a strong position in the growing installation market in the Nordic
region (comprising Sweden, Norway and Finland), which are estimated at approximately SEK 98 billion,
SEK 75 billion and SEK 59 billion, respectively, and have a combined approximate value of SEK 231 billion as
of December 31, 2019, and in 2019, we had the second largest share of Sweden’s installation market by revenue
according to Prognoscentret. Moreover, in December 2020, we entered into a sale and purchase agreement to
acquire Fidelix, a technology-driven building automation service company, which is expected to provide us with
a market-leading position within the building automation market in the Nordics.

We provide installation and service assignments in various types of properties, industrial facilities and
infrastructure projects for a diverse customer base consisting over 20,000 large and small customers, which
include construction companies, the public sector, property owners and industrial companies. Our strong
relationships with our customers have contributed to an order backlog of SEK 8,245 million and an LTM order
intake of SEK 9,859 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2020, and we currently have over 3,000 ongoing
projects. We take on primarily two types of assignments: contractor assignments and service assignments. The
proportion of contractor assignments and service assignments represented 60% and 40%, respectively, of our net
revenue for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020.

Our operations are decentralized and governed based on a shared framework, clear allocation of roles and
responsibilities and systematic monitoring. Our current operating organization is divided into five specific
business areas: three in Sweden (Assemblin El, Assemblin VS and Assemblin Ventilation), one in Norway
(Assemblin Norway) and one in Finland (Assemblin Finland), comprising over 166 branches across over 100
locations with over 5,800 employees in the Nordic region. We believe that our decentralized business model
contributes to the profitability of our operations. This decentralized and entrepreneurial business model allows us
to swiftly adjust to a largely variable cost structure and promotes enterprise and accountability at all levels of our
structure with the president of each business area being responsible, together with their management groups, for
the operations and earnings in their respective business areas. We have been owned by Triton Partners since
2015, and since then have expanded our geographical presence and volumes through the acquisition of
38 additional companies to date (excluding Fidelix), the largest of which being a carve-out from construction
company Skanska, Skanska Installation, acquired in 2016. Our organic and inorganic growth has made us into a
complete installation and service partner, with the strength of a multidisciplinary group and the personal presence
of a local company.

In the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, we had total net revenue of SEK 10,133 million, a net profit for
the period of SEK 42 million, EBITA of SEK 304 million, Adjusted EBITA of SEK 569 million and Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA of SEK 851 million. This was supported by our strong order backlog, which stood at
SEK 8,245 million as of September 30, 2020.

**Our Segments**

Our operating segments are based primarily on the main operational orientation the segments have. Our operating
segments comprise:

Š _Electrical: offers comprehensive solutions for planning, installation, service and maintenance in electricity_
and automation in Sweden as well as refurbishment of electrical motors and generators.

Š _Heating and Sanitation: plans, installs and maintains technical systems for heating and sanitation,_
sprinklers, industrial piping and district heating in all types of buildings in Sweden.

Š _Ventilation: specialists in construction, installation, service and maintenance of ventilation facilities and_
cooling solutions in Sweden as well as two specialized workshops producing rectangular ventilation ducts.

Š _Norway: focused on the greater Oslo area and Svalbard, offers installation and service solutions within_
heating and sanitation, electricity and ventilation.

Š _Finland: operations offer services in electricity, ventilation, heating and sanitation, as well as in automation_
and energy efficiency.

This division into segments is the primary division that our management observes as regards earnings, capital
requirements and cash flows.

**Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations**

**General Economic Conditions and Activity in the Installation Market**

Macroeconomic factors in the geographic markets in which we operate affect customer demand and, in turn, our
results of operations. These factors include GDP fluctuations in Sweden, Norway and Finland, the three main
countries in which we operate. During periods of strong GDP growth, our activity is fueled by industrial
investments, public sector infrastructure projects and commercial construction. During recessionary periods, our
installation business typically experiences a decline in net revenue which correlates to reduced levels of capital
investments by our customers. This includes reduced spending by national and local authorities, as well as
industrial and utility companies, although public sector expenditure tends to decrease less relative to private
sector spending. However, during recessionary periods, when customers significantly reduce their capital
expenditures, demand in our service business, which is mainly driven by renovation and maintenance
expenditures, has been generally resilient to macroeconomic changes and tends to be countercyclical, providing a
more stable source of income. When macroeconomic conditions improve, we generally experience increases in
revenues in both our installation business and our service business, as well as increased order flow.

During the periods presented and prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, macroeconomic conditions remained
generally stable, with high activity levels in the installation market. Housing construction slowed down in the
metropolitan regions, which was however offset by increased public investments in primarily major
infrastructure projects, hospitals and schools.

While the COVID-19 outbreak has had, and continues to have, a material impact on business around the world
and the economic environments in which they operate, our results of operations and cash flows have proven
resilient to date. Although demand in our installation and services business has been adversely affected, the
impact to date has been relatively low. Our net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 increased
to SEK 7,277 million, compared to SEK 7,122 million, with organic performance remaining stable. In addition,
although order intakes decreased to SEK 7,252 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 from SEK
8,652 million in the corresponding period in 2019, this decrease was driven primarily by two large orders in the
nine months ended September 30, 2019 (representing a combined order intake of SEK 1,387 million), which
provided a significant increase to our order intake, as opposed to any significant dampening of demand or
cancellations due to COVID-19. Moreover, while we have experienced some disruptions to our installation
projects (due to COVID-19 outbreaks at a limited number of construction sites) and services assignments (due to
stringent lock-down measures in the second quarter of 2020), to date these have not been significant and we do
not believe they are indicative of a macroeconomic shift in demand for our projects and services. Nevertheless,
while our net revenue and order intake for the first three quarters of 2020 are promising, we expect the ultimate
significance of the impact of reduced economic activity and disruptions, including the extent of their adverse
impact on financial and operational results, will be primarily determined by the length of time that such
reductions and disruptions continue, which will, in turn, depend on the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the
impact of measures that might be imposed in response to the pandemic and whether a vaccine or drug can be

developed and deployed that allows business operations to return to their pre-pandemic form. Additionally,
although to date the installation market has proved to be relatively resilient to the COVID-19 pandemic and we
believe the underlying drivers for long-term growth remain, we have experienced increased competition due to
more uncertain market conditions. In light of this uncertainty, we believe it is beneficial to be a large, stable
player with an ability to identify and react quickly to market changes, which we believe our leading market
position, strong financial position and decentralized business model allows us to achieve.

**Active Portfolio Management**

We generally seek to maintain balanced and sustained revenue flows by prioritizing smaller, shorter-term, highmargin contracts and maintaining a balance between installation and service contracts with a diverse range of
customers operating in various end-markets. When one of our end-markets, such as industrial manufacturing, is
experiencing lower expenditure, we can benefit from increased spending in another sector, such as hospitals
(which are generally not impacted by the business cycle). We also actively reallocate resources in response to
demand in those regions. Providing sales visibility and allowing active management is our installation business
order book, which we track with two metrics we call order intake and order backlog. Order intake represents the
value of projects received during any relevant period, plus changes to existing projects made during that period.
Order backlog represents the value of remaining (not yet accrued) production value in all projects not generated
at the end of the relevant period.

**Our Cost Structure and Operational Improvement Program**

We have a flexible cost structure, which helps to preserve margins during economic downturns. Variable and
semi-variable costs (including subcontracting costs, temporary and fixed-term employees and installation
materials and consumables used) constitute the majority of our operating expenses. We maintain low levels of
inventory and our suppliers deliver directly to our work sites, which helps reduce our fixed costs and allows us to
adjust our cost structure in response to market demand. For the year ended December 31, 2019, raw materials and
consumables amounted to SEK 3,404 million, or 35.0%, subcontractors and purchased services amounted to
SEK 1,366 million, or 14.0%, personnel costs amounted to SEK 4,134 million, or 42.5%, consultant fees
amounted to SEK 71 million, or 0.7%, IT costs and telephony amounted to SEK 69 million, 0.7%, depreciation
and amortization amounted to SEK 217 million, or 2.2% and other operating costs amounted to SEK 422 million,
or 4.3% of our total operating expenses of SEK 9,726 million.

In addition, during 2019, in particular in the fourth quarter of 2019, we undertook a number of cost saving
initiatives and operational efficiency measures to improve profitability, comprising:

Š reductions in overhead costs in Group functions, business area regional level as well as in branches;

Š closure of unprofitable branches, including eight branches and several sub-branches; and

Š turnaround plans being implemented for selected unprofitable branches across all segments.

In connection with the implementation of the cost savings initiatives described above, we incurred restructuring
costs in the aggregate amount of SEK 148 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 (representing an increase from
the initial estimated SEK 121 million due to an increase in the originally anticipated number of branch closures
and related costs).

**Seasonality**

Our revenues and costs are subject to seasonal variation, limiting the overall comparability of interim financial
periods. We account for revenue in accordance with the degree of completion of the project. Therefore, when a
public holiday falls in a given interim period, there are fewer working days and as a result we recognize less
revenue from our ongoing projects.

Our working capital needs are seasonal, although they are generally negative due to our customer contracts and
focus on invoice collection. We invoice our customers regularly, in the case of ongoing and completed
installation and service projects. Cash flow tends to be generally the strongest in the fourth quarter, with public
and private sector customers seeking to meet their maintenance and operating expenses budgets but also due to
many projects being completed in this quarter before the year-end and onset of winter. Cash flow in August and
September tends to be relatively weaker because of lower business activity in the month of July and August,
which is the main annual holiday period in our markets.

82


-----

Despite this seasonal trend, we have experienced strong cash flows during the nine months ended September 30,
2020, which have been positively affected by increased focus on invoicing practices during the COVID-19
outbreak, resulting in working capital inflows. Moreover, to date, we have not experienced any significant delays
in the payment of invoices by our customers. We may, however, experience an increase in working capital needs
if the markets in which we operate are subject to significant recessionary periods due to the COVID-19 pandemic
or otherwise. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Amounts included in our
_estimated order backlog may not result in actual revenue or translate into profits, and our estimated order_
_backlog is subject to delays, customer bankruptcy, accounting errors and unexpected adjustments and is_
_therefore an uncertain indicator of future results of operations.” Increased demand in our service business,_
which tends to be countercyclical, typically result in more working capital outflows, as compared to our
installation projects.

**Foreign Currency Exchange Rates**

Our reported results of operations and financial condition are affected by exchange rate fluctuations due to both
transaction risk and financial reports from operations abroad. Our business operations are characterized by a
relatively low level of transactional currency risk since our purchases and sales are made in the same local
currency with minimal exposure to imported components. However, we are exposed to risks relating to
translation into Swedish kronor of income statements and balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries with local
reporting denominated in euro (in the case of operations in Finland) and Norwegian kroner.

_Transactional risk: Transactional risk arises when our subsidiaries execute transactions in a currency other than_
their functional currency. Transactions in foreign currency are restated in the functional currency at the exchange
rate in effect on the transaction date. Functional currency is the currency in which the primary financial
environments where the companies conduct their operations. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency
are restated in the functional currency at the exchange rate in effect on the balance-sheet date. Exchange rate
differences arising in the restatements are recognized in profit or loss for the year. Non-monetary assets and
liabilities recognized at historical cost are restated at the exchange rate on the transaction date. Non-monetary
assets and liabilities recognized at fair value are restated in the functional currency at the exchange rate in effect
on the date of measurement at fair value. We generally benefit from a natural hedge against currency fluctuations
in the three countries in which we operate because we incur costs and receive revenues in the applicable local
currency. However, we purchase equipment from suppliers who generally operate in euro, and these suppliers
may change their Swedish kronor prices to reflect fluctuations in the Swedish kronor to euro exchange rate.

_Financial reports from operations abroad: Assets and liabilities in operations abroad, including goodwill and_
other Group-related surpluses and deficits, are restated from the functional currency of the operations abroad in
the Group’s reporting currency at the exchange rate in effect on the balance-sheet date. Revenue and expenses in
operations abroad are restated in Swedish kronor at an average rate that constituted an approximation of the
exchange rates that were in effect on the respective transaction dates. Translation differences arising in
connection with currency restatements are recognized in Other comprehensive income, and are accumulated in a
separate component in equity, designated as translation reserves. In the event the operations abroad are not
wholly owned, the translation difference is allocated to holdings with a non-controlling interest based on its
proportional ownership share. When controlling interest, significant interest or joint controlling interest for
operations abroad are dissolved, the accumulated translation differences attributable to the operations are
realized, at which point they are reclassified from the translation reserves in equity to profit or loss for the year.
In the event a sale occurs but controlling interest remains, a proportional share of accumulated translation
differences from the translation reserve is transferred to holdings with a non-controlling interest. In the event of a
sale of portions of associates and joint ventures where significant interest or joint controlling interest remains, a
proportional share of the translation differences are reclassified to profit or loss for the year.

We did not experience significant gains or losses as a result of fluctuations of Norwegian kroner and the euro
against Swedish kronor during the periods under review.

**Personnel Costs and Availability of Skilled Personnel**

For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, we had personnel costs of SEK 3,487 million, SEK
3,648 million and SEK 4,134 million, respectively, which accounted for 43.3%, 43.1% and 42.5%, respectively
of our total operating expenses (which includes costs of production and selling and administrative expenses) of
SEK 8,054 million, SEK 8,472 million and SEK 9,726 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and
2019, respectively. As a result, increases in labor costs have a material impact on our result of operations. As

83


-----

almost all of our labor force is subject to collective bargaining agreements, wages are generally subject to annual
increases determined by the labor unions in accordance with the collective bargaining agreements. Between 2017
and 2019, our personnel costs have increased by 18.6%, driven by the increases in wages and provisions for
severances (in connection with our accelerated profitability program), as well as a more modest increase in the
total number of employees and certain changes to expense category classifications applied starting from 2019.

In addition, our growth can at times be constrained by our ability to find skilled labor force necessary to complete
our installation projects or perform service assignments. See “Risk Factors—Our success is highly dependent on
_the ability to recruit and retain technical and other key personnel.” For example, future restrictions on travel,_
including due to the COVID-19 outbreak, may also adversely affect our ability to successfully find sufficient
subcontractors, which could have a material adverse effect on our installation projects, particularly in Norway.
Moreover, increased sick leave experienced during the COVID-19 outbreak may adversely affect our service
assignments as it is generally more difficult to find suitable replacement personnel (as compared to installation
projects, for which subcontracting is typically an available option). Although there have been periodic increases
in sick leave (including during the three months ended September 30, 2020), to date our services business has not
been significantly adversely affected. In particular, we have adapted our operations to comply with the
authorities’ recommendations in Sweden, Finland and Norway. Moreover, a standard risk assessment that is
conducted for all assignments now includes an analysis of any possible spread of infection. We will continue to
prioritize the safety and health of our employees and customers, including by monitoring developments in respect
of the COVID-19 outbreak and by adapting our operations to implement any further government
recommendations.

**Equipment and Materials Used**

We purchase equipment (machinery, technical equipment and installation equipment) and installation materials
in the ordinary course of our business. Our expenses for this equipment and these materials are subject to
fluctuations based on our activity levels and the prices of the equipment and materials we purchase. During
periods of strong economic growth, our expenditures on equipment and other materials are higher, due to the fact
that our installation business, which requires more purchases of materials, makes up a larger share of our total
sales than is the case during recessionary periods. We continually seek to consolidate our purchases to achieve
volume-based discounts from our suppliers. During economic downturns, when our service business makes up a
larger share of our total sales than our installation business, our expenditures on equipment and other materials
are lower, due to the fact that maintenance services require the use of less equipment and materials. The prices of
the equipment we purchase are subject to variation based on the fluctuations in the prices of raw materials
(primarily aluminum, copper and steel) used to produce that equipment.

**Acquisitions**

In recent years, external growth has contributed to the overall growth of our business, and we intend to continue
to pursue acquisitions in order to increase our market presence, our service offering and our service capacity. In
2016, we acquired Skanska Installation, further solidifying our strong position in the Swedish market. In 2017,
we made three small “bolt-on” acquisitions in Sweden, and as a result, our net revenue increased by
SEK 55 million. In 2018, we completed five small “bolt-on” acquisitions in Sweden, Norway and Finland, as a
result of which our net revenue increased by SEK 288 million. In 2019, we acquired businesses with a total
turnover of over SEK 500 million, strengthening our Electrical business area’s industrial service footprint
(Norrlands Industimontage), building our Heating and Sanitation business area’s capabilities in the district
heating niche (Värmesvets Entreprenad, KP Svets & Smide and Industri och Varmemontage Werme AB) as well
as expanding our geographical coverage in Norway to the Lillehammar region (Arve Hagen AS, Ramsøy AS and
Gjøvik Varme and Sanitær AS).

In the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we completed seven small “bolt-on” acquisitions (in the form of
share and asset purchases) in Sweden across several of our business areas, including: Electrical (Elservice i Åmål
AB), Heating and Sanitation (Botkyrka VVS & Fastighetsservice AB, El & Installationsteknik i Stockholm AB
and SDC Stockholm Design & Construction AB) and Ventilation (Luftkompaniet Sjöblom AB, Projektuppdrag
Syd AB and Örestadskyl AB). These companies have a total of over 80 employees and estimated aggregated
annual revenues of SEK 246 million. These acquisitions were made with cash on balance sheet. Additional
variable cash consideration of up to SEK 59 million was payable over the next three years as of September 30,
2020. See Note 7 to the Unaudited Condensed Interim Financial Statements and Note 32 to the Audited
Combined Financial Statements. In addition, since October 1, 2020, we have completed an additional thirteen
small “bolt-on” acquisitions (in the form of share and asset purchases) in Sweden, Norway and Finland and

84


-----

across each of our business areas, including: Electrical (J.Östling & C. Sparf El AB, Åby Eltjänst AB, EA
Installationer AB and TIS Tervell Installation och Service AB), Heating and Sanitation (Mälardalens Fjärrvärme
Entreprenad AB, Essen Rör AB, Kalmar VVS och El-Montage AB and Vantec System AB), Ventilation (FBI
Fastighet o Butiksinstallationer AB), Norway (NOR Klima T. Svendsen AS) and Finland (KK Kylmäpalvelu Oy,
Salon Kylmäpoja Oy and Karjalan Kylmäpalvelu Oy). These companies have a total of over 270 employees and
estimated aggregated annual revenues of over SEK 450 million. The acquisitions completed after September 30,
2020 were made with cash on balance sheet for an aggregate cash consideration of approximately SEK
310 million, of which SEK 300 million has been paid as of the date hereof and SEK 10 million will be payable at
a later date under the terms of the relevant acquisition agreements. Furthermore, up to SEK 80 million of
additional variable cash consideration is payable over the next three years for the acquisitions completed after
September 30, 2020. See Note 7 to the Unaudited Condensed Interim Financial Statements.

Excluding the asset purchase transactions (Elservice i Åmål AB, Mälardalens Fjärrvärme Entreprenad AB and
FBI Fastighet o Butiksinstallationer AB), we estimate, based on each company’s historical EBITDA derived
from its management accounts, as adjusted in a manner consistent with the adjustments applied to our Adjusted
EBITDA to the extent applicable and as further adjusted for the application of our accounting policies and other
items, that the acquisitions completed since September 30, 2019 would have a positive EBITDA impact of
SEK 101 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 if each of the acquisitions was completed on
October 1, 2019 (of which, SEK 39 million is attributable to completed acquisitions in the twelve months ended
September 30, 2020, with the remaining SEK 62 million attributable to completed acquisitions after
September 30, 2020).

On December 8, 2020, Assemblin AB entered into a sale and purchase agreement to acquire Fidelix from the
shareholders and option rights holders in Fidelix. The Fidelix Acquisition is subject to approval from the Finnish
competition authority. We estimate based on Fidelix’s historical EBITDA derived from its management
accounts, as adjusted for certain non-recurring items and the estimated pro forma effect of an acquisition by
Fidelix, that the Fidelix Acquisition would have a positive EBITDA impact of SEK 80 million for the twelve
months ended September 30, 2020 if such acquisition had completed on October 1, 2019. The adjustment is
based on Fidelix’s historical EBITDA derived from its management accounts, as adjusted for certain
non-recurring items, the estimated pro forma effect of an acquisition by Fidelix and the application of consistent
accounting policies. See “Summary—Fidelix—Fidelix Acquisition Rationale.”

Non-recurring costs related to these acquisitions are discussed below.

**Items Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations**

Items affecting comparability (including impairment of rights-of-use assets) are categorized as acquisition,
integration and start-up costs, restructuring costs, transformation costs and other items affecting comparability.
These items, which are discussed below, do not occur regularly and affect comparability between periods both,
year over year and quarter over quarter. We believe it is important to clearly distinguish how these items affect
each period and therefore show adjusted performance measures. The items affecting comparability (including
impairment of rights-of-use assets) are also consistent with how management reviews and evaluates the business
and consequently the information is also included in the operating segments’ disclosures in notes to the Financial
Statements.

The table below sets out the categories of items affecting comparability (including impairment of rights-of-use
assets) of our results of operations during periods under review:

_Acquisitions, integration and startup costs_

We acquire new business and establish new branches when opportunities arise and incur expenses in relation to
due diligence and start-up cost. As presented above, this item includes costs incurred in connection with certain

85


-----

bolt-on acquisitions, certain integration costs related to acquisitions and any net operating loss of newly set-up
branches during their first twelve months of operation, during which start-up costs are incurred relating to
training, tooling and ramp-up of order backlog.

Costs incurred in connection with certain bolt-on acquisitions included SEK 2 million in connection with five
acquisitions in Norway and Sweden for the year ended December 31, 2018, SEK 1 million in connection with
three acquisitions in Norway and Sweden for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, SEK 5 million in
connection with nine acquisitions in Norway, Sweden and Finland for the year ended December 31, 2019 and
SEK 1 million in connection with seven acquisitions in Sweden for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

Integration costs included SEK 18 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 in connection with the
integration of Skanska Installation after being acquired in 2016.

Net operating losses of newly set-up branches included SEK 8 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2019, and net operating losses of newly set-up branches of SEK 14 million for the year ended December 31,
2019. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we incurred net operating losses of SEK 7 million.

_Restructuring costs_

For the year ended December 31, 2017, restructuring costs included costs relating to headcount reductions in
Finland (SEK 8 million) and management severance costs (SEK 6 million). For the year ended December 31,
2018, we incurred SEK 3 million in connection with a legal restructuring.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, restructuring costs comprised costs relating to the closure of
unprofitable branches and personnel redundancies (SEK 12 million) and impairment of rights-of-use assets
(SEK 4 million). We incurred an additional SEK 155 million in the three months ended December 31, 2019,
resulting in total restructuring costs of SEK 171 million in 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2019, these
included costs relating to the closure of unprofitable branches and personnel redundancies (SEK 128 million) and
impairment of rights-of-use assets relating to vacated premises (SEK 43 million).

For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, restructuring costs comprised costs relating to the closure and
restructuring of branches, including personnel redundancies (SEK 26 million), as well as project-related
adjustments (SEK 14 million) and income from the sale of a business in Finland (SEK 6 million).

_Transformation costs_

For the year ended December 31, 2017, transformation costs included costs incurred in connection with
improvement in our IT systems.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, transformation costs of SEK 6 million comprised costs incurred
in connection with our brand development campaign and costs related to leadership development and to the
strengthening of our internal controls systems. We incurred an additional SEK 18 million in the three months
ended December 31, 2019 (relating primarily to the strengthening of our internal controls systems), resulting in
total transformation costs of SEK 24 million in 2019.

_Other_

For the year ended December 31, 2017, other items affecting comparability include costs related to an
impairment in relation to our old IT systems lacking appropriate functionality.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, we benefitted from the reversal of other income from settlement of a
breach of warranty claim in our favor in connection with an acquisition (SEK 25 million) due to a breach of SPA
warranties. This was partly offset by costs incurred in connection with the refinancing of certain debt facilities
(SEK 4 million).

For the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred SEK 31 million of costs in connection with the refinancing
of certain bank facilities.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we incurred SEK 9 million in costs relating to the refinancing of
certain bank facilities with the Original Notes.

**Description of Key Line Items**

Set forth below is a brief description of our key income statement line items.

_Net revenue consist primarily of revenue from construction contracts and service assignments._

Š For our construction contracts, revenue from ongoing contracts is recognized over time on the basis of
assignment expenditures incurred in relation to the total estimated assignment fees of the assignment. Costs
associated with this are recognized in earnings as they arise. Revenue is based on a contractual fixed price; the
remuneration amount is variable only in exceptional cases. Changes in the scope of the assignment, claims and
incentive remuneration are included in project revenue to the extent that they are agreed upon with the
customer and can be reliably measured. A fundamental condition for reporting revenue over time is that the
course of events can reasonably be measured against completion of the performance obligation. For projects in
which the outcome of a performance obligation cannot reasonably be measured, but coverage is expected for
the expenditures that arise from completing the performance obligation, only revenue for expenditures incurred
up until the result of the performance obligation can reasonably be measured is reported.

Š For our service assignments, revenue and the appurtenant costs are recognized over time (meaning, in pace
with the service being provided to the customer). Measurement of the course of events is established on the
basis of assignment expenditures incurred in relation to the total estimated assignment expenditures.

For further information on our revenue recognition policy, see Note 1 to the Audited Combined Financial
Statements.

_Cost for production primarily consist of (i) personnel costs, including wages, bonuses and social security costs,_
(ii) raw materials and consumables costs, (iii) subcontractors and purchased services costs, and (iv) premises
directly linked to production, such as warehouses or workshops. In the year ended December 31, 2019 and the
nine months ended September 30, 2020, personnel costs accounted for the largest proportion of cost for
production.

_Sales and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel expenses in connection with the general_
management of our business, including wages, bonuses and social security costs, rental costs for our premises
and other overhead costs as well as non-billable white-collar time.

_Financial income consists of interest income on invested funds, dividend income, and gains on changes in value_
of financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss. Dividend income is recognized when the right to
receive dividends has been established.

_Financial expenses consist of interest charged on loans, and the effect of unwinding the present value of_
provisions.

_Net financial items consist of net financial income and expense and net foreign exchange gains and foreign_
exchange losses.

_Tax consists of consists of current tax (comprising income tax in each country where we operate) and deferred_
tax.

**Accounting Standards Adopted During the Period**

For a description of certain accounting policies adopted during the periods presented, see Note 1 to the Audited
Combined Financial Statements. Due to its relatively more significant impact on the periods presented, IFRS 16
Leases is described below.

**IFRS 16 Leases**

As of January 1, 2019, we apply IFRS 16 Leases. This reporting standard replaces IAS 17 Leases. The Group has
selected the modified retrospective approach as the transition method, which means that the comparison figures for
2018 and earlier periods are not restated, and that the difference between right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are
recognized in equity adjusted for pre-paid lease expenses and reserves for onerous contracts as at January 1, 2019.
The effects of IFRS 16 are recognized at the Group level. The Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease
liability on the commencement date of a lease. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which consists of
the original value of the lease liability plus lease expenses paid on or before the commencement date and any initial

direct expenses. The right-of-use asset is thereafter depreciated on a straight-line basis from the commencement
date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the asset and the end of the lease term.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the future lease expenses over the term of the lease
that have not been paid on the commencement date. The lease expenses are discounted with the incremental
borrowing rate or implicit interest rate of the lease. The term of the lease comprises the non-cancellable period,
with the addition of further periods in the contract if, on the commencement date, it is deemed reasonably certain
that these will be exercised.

The lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective rate method. The lease liability is remeasured if
the future lease expenses change as the result of such factors as changes to an index or price. When the lease
liability is remeasured this way, an equivalent adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset.

_Leases where the Group is lessee_

Previously, the Group determined whether an agreement contained a lease in accordance with IFRIC 4
Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease. As of January 1, 2019, the Group determines whether
an agreement contains a lease based on the definition of leases in IFRS 16.

At the transition to IFRS 16, the Group chose to apply the relief rule of “inheriting” the previous definition of
leasing in conjunction with the transition. This means that IFRS 16 is applied to agreements that were previously
identified as leases, and that IFRS 16 is not applied to agreements that previously were deemed not to contain
leases. Consequently, the definition of leases under IFRS 16 is applied only the agreements that were amended or
signed after January 1, 2019.

Previously, the Group classified leases as operating or finance leases based on whether the lease transferred the
risks and rewards of ownership of the underlying asset. In accordance with IFRS 16, the Group recognizes
right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for most leases (in other words, the lease is included in the statement of
financial position); exemptions from this are indicated below.

_Leases previously classified as operating leases under IAS 17_

At the transition, the lease liabilities were measured at the present value of the remaining lease expenses,
discounted by the Group’s marginal interest rates on borrowings on the initial date of application (January 1,
2019). Each right-of-use asset was measured at an amount corresponding to the lease liability, adjusted for any
prepaid or accrued lease expenses and reserves for onerous contracts.

We chose to apply the following solutions in practice:

Š Applied a discount rate based on the Group’s financing expenses on various maturities.

Š Adjusted the right-of-use asset by an amount recognized as a provision for operating leases that constituted
onerous leases, immediately before the first date of application, as an alternative to performing an
impairment review.

Š Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities have not been recognized for leases for which the lease term finishes
within twelve months or earlier (short-term leases).

Š Excluded initial direct payments from the measurement of the right-of-use asset on the first date of
application.

**_Effect on the financial statements_**

At the date of the transition to IFRS 16, we recognized right-of-use assets of SEK 723 million and lease liabilities
of SEK 760 million, of which SEK 80 million were short-term lease liabilities. The difference between assets and
liabilities is due to the reclassification of pre-paid lease expenses, and moreover, rights of use being recognized
based on IFRS 16 having been applied since the start of the agreement as well as the right-of-use assets being
reduced by reserves for onerous leases recognized in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities
and Contingent Assets immediately prior to the transition to IFRS 16 on December 31, 2018.

When measuring the lease liability, we discounted its lease expenses at the marginal interest rate on borrowings
at January 1, 2019. The interest rate used in discounting future flows lies between 1.7% and 4.8%, depending on
the tenor of the contract. Previous financial leases have been reclassified from property, plant and equipment to
right-of-use assets.

**_Net revenue_**

Net revenue increased by SEK 155 million, or 2.2%, from SEK 7,122 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2019 to SEK 7,277 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Of the total growth,
3.8% was due to acquisitions, which was offset primarily by adverse foreign exchange effects. Organic growth
was (0.1)%, which was primarily attributable to the closure of a number of unprofitable units in late 2019 for
which we did not generate the same level of net revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 due to the
winding down of those branches. Additionally, we experienced enhanced production in several major projects in
the nine months ended September 30, 2019, which we was not repeated to the same extent in the corresponding
period in 2020. Net revenue from service assignments increased by 6.5% to SEK 2,862 million from
SEK 2,688 million, and net revenue from contractor assignments decreased slightly to SEK 4,414 million from
SEK 4,434 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 from the same period in the
prior year. Order intake for the period decreased 16.2% period-on-period to SEK 7,252 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2020, compared to SEK 8,652 million during the nine months ended September 30,
2019, driven in particular by two large orders in 2019: Stockholm Bypass project from the Swedish
Transportation Administration and the new health care building in the Malmö hospital district (representing a
combined order intake of SEK 1,387 million). The order backlog as of September 30, 2020 decreased to
SEK 8,245 million, compared to SEK 8,478 million as of September 30, 2019.

_Electrical Segment_

Net revenue of the Electrical segment for the period remained flat at SEK 2,932 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2020 compared to SEK 2,934 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. Net

89


-----

revenue grew in the first six months of 2020 (as compared to the corresponding period 2019), which was offset
by a decrease in net revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2020 due to enhanced activity in
operations in the corresponding period in 2019. Order intake decreased from SEK 3,309 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2019 compared to SEK 3,038 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2020, driven primarily by two large projects in 2019: the assignments in Malmö’s hospital district and the LKAB
relocation project in Kiruna. As of September 30, 2020, order backlog amounted to SEK 3,102 million compared
to SEK 2,970 million as of September 30, 2019.

_Heating and Sanitation Segment_

Net revenue of the Heating and Sanitation segment increased by 0.8%, from SEK 1,908 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2019 to SEK 1,924 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The
increase in net revenue over the first six months of 2020 were offset in part by a decrease in net revenue for the
three months ended September 30, 2020 (compared to the corresponding period in 2019), primarily due to the
closure of a number of unprofitable units in late 2019 and the enhanced level of activity in operations during the
second half of 2019. Order intake decreased from SEK 2,351 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2019 compared to SEK 1,963 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, driven primarily by two
large projects included in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 described above in connection with the
Electrical segment, which significantly contributed to the order intake for that period. Order backlog as of
September 30, 2020 increased to SEK 2,103 million, compared to SEK 2,085 million as of September 30, 2018.

_Ventilation Segment_

Net revenue of the Ventilation segment decreased by 1.7%, from SEK 1,000 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2019 to SEK 983 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, driven primarily by
lower sales volume in the first three months of 2020 (compared to the corresponding period in 2019) attributable
to delayed start dates in a small number of major publicly funded assignments due to slower planning process
than anticipated (and unrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic). This decrease was offset in part by increases in net
revenue over the subsequent six months of 2020 (as compared to the corresponding period in 2019). Decreases in
order intakes from SEK 1,932 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to
SEK 1,675 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, were driven primarily by the two large
projects included in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 described above in connection with the Electrical
segment, which significantly contributed to the order intake for that period. Order backlog as of September 30,
2020 decreased to SEK 1,675 million, compared to SEK 1,932 million as of September 30, 2019.

_Norway Segment_

Net revenue of the Norway segment increased by 19.8%, from SEK 904 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2019 to SEK 1,083 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, driven primarily by
previously completed acquisitions and ongoing projects within those companies and new installation and service
assignments. Order intake decreased slightly from SEK 1,176 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2019 compared to SEK 1,132 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Management believes that
order book in Norway is currently at full capacity. Accordingly, we took a selective approach to undertaking new
projects. Order backlog as of September 30, 2020 decreased to SEK 1,132 million, compared to
SEK 1,176 million as of September 30, 2019.

_Finland Segment_

Net revenue of the Finland segment increased by 1.7%, from SEK 418 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2019 to SEK 425 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, driven by new
assignments, which included primarily small installation and service assignments. Order intake increased from
SEK 369 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to SEK 427 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2020. Order backlog as of September 30, 2020 decreased to SEK 233 million,
compared to SEK 316 million as of September 30, 2019.

**_Cost for production_**

Cost for production increased by SEK 190 million, or 3.3%, from SEK 5,828 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2019 to SEK 6,018 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, driven by increases in

90


-----

the installation and service assignments. The slight increase in cost of production relative to net revenue increase
was primarily related to business mix (which, among other things, resulted in an increased utilization of whitecollar labor and shifted costs from sales and administrative expenses to cost of production).

**_Sales and administrative expenses_**

Sales and administrative expenses decreased by SEK 61 million, or 5.9% from SEK 1,026 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2019 to SEK 965 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, driven by
increased efficiency and the effects of our accelerated profitability program.

**_Operating profit_**

Operating profit increased by SEK 26 million, or 9.7%, from SEK 268 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2019 to SEK 294 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, as the increase in net
revenue and decrease in sales and administrative expenses were in excess of increases in the cost for production.

**_Net financial items_**

Net financial items deteriorated by SEK 87 million from negative SEK 59 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2019 to negative SEK 146 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The change in
net financial items and other financial expenses was attributable to the refinancing of bank loans into the Original
Notes (which carry a higher interest rate) at the end of 2019. Net financial items in 2019 were positively
impacted by a dividend from the partially owned company Elajo in the second quarter, which we did not benefit
from in the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

**_Tax for the period_**

Tax for the period amounted to SEK 47 million and SEK 35 million in the nine months ended September 30,
2019 and 2020, respectively, corresponding to 22.5% and 23.8% of profit before tax of SEK 209 million and
SEK 147 million for the respective periods.

**_Profit for the period_**

Profit for the period decreased by SEK 50 million, or 30.9%, from SEK 162 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2019 to SEK 112 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, as a result of the factors
described above.

**_Adjusted EBITA and margins_**

Our Adjusted EBITA for the period increased from SEK 312 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2019 to SEK 365 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, which is an increase of 17.0%, while
Adjusted EBITA Margin was 4.4% and 5.0% in the respective periods. The improvement in earnings and
profitability was driven by measures to enhance profitability that were taken in late 2019 through our accelerated
profitability program, in combination with profitable acquisitions. These improvements were offset in part by
negative effects on demand from the COVID-19 pandemic (particularly in second quarter of 2020), as well as a
project write-down in Finland (also in the second quarter of 2020). In addition, earnings and profitability for the
nine months ended September 30, 2019 were negatively impacted by the first-quarter project write-downs in
Norway and Finland totaling SEK 23 million (before recovering in both the second and third quarters).

Adjusted EBITA for the Electrical segment increased by 8.6% from SEK 128 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2019 to SEK 139 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, while the Adjusted
EBITA Margin was 4.4% and 4.7% in the respective periods, primarily driven by the positive effects of our
accelerated profitability program.

For the Heating and Sanitation segment, Adjusted EBITA increased by 10.1% from SEK 89 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2019 to SEK 98 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, and while
the Adjusted EBITA Margin also improved from 4.7% to 5.1% over the same period, primarily due to the
positive effects of our accelerated profitability program.

-----

Adjusted EBITA for the Ventilation segment increased by 13.9% from SEK 36 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2019 to SEK 41 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, while Adjusted
EBITA Margin also improved from 3.6% to 4.2% over the same period. The difference year-on-year is
attributable primarily to the positive effects of our accelerated profitability program.

In the Norway segment, Adjusted EBITA increased by 72.7% from SEK 44 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2019 to SEK 76 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, while Adjusted EBITA
Margin also improved from 4.9% to 7.0% over the same period. The difference year-on-year is attributable to the
positive effects of our accelerated profitability program, previously completed acquisitions and project writedowns in 2019.

In the Finland segment, Adjusted EBITA decreased from SEK 5 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2019 to negative SEK 1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, while Adjusted
EBITA Margin also declined from 1.2% to negative 0.2% over the same period.

**_Net revenue_**

Net revenue increased by SEK 1,093 million, or 12.3%, from SEK 8,885 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018 to SEK 9,978 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Of the total growth, 8.3% is
attributable to organic growth and the remainder was due to acquisitions (3.7%) and foreign exchange effects
(0.3%). Organic growth was driven primarily by increasing volumes from both installation and service
assignments in all business areas, particularly in the Electrical segment. Net revenue from service assignments
and contractor assignment operations increased by 13.2% to SEK 3,833 million from SEK 3,387 million and
11.8% to SEK 6,145 million from SEK 5,498 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019 from
the same period in the prior year. Order intake for the period increased 19.0% period-on-period to
SEK 11,258 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to SEK 9,459 million during the year
ended December 31, 2018, driven in particular by two large orders: Stockholm Bypass project from the Swedish
Transportation Administration and the new health care building in the Malmö hospital district. The large order
intake meant that order backlog as of December 31, 2019 had reached a record high of SEK 8,478 million,
compared to SEK 6,971 million as of December 31, 2018.

_Electrical Segment_

Net revenue of the Electrical segment for the period increased by 15.6%, from SEK 3,592 million for the year
ended December 31, 2018 to SEK 4,151 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Growth in 2019 was
primarily organic. Order intake increased from SEK 4,214 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to
SEK 4,507 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. New assignments included the new electrical and
automation assignments in Malmö’s hospital district as well as the LKAB relocation project in Kiruna, which
together total SEK 573 million. Other new assignments pertain to contract and service assignments. As of
December 31, 2019, order backlog amounted to SEK 3,029 million compared to SEK 2,590 million as of
December 31, 2018.

_Heating and Sanitation Segment_

Net revenue of the Heating and Sanitation segment increased by 10.6%, from SEK 2,388 million for the year
ended December 31, 2018 to SEK 2,642 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, driven by previously
completed acquisitions and organic growth. Order intake increased from SEK 2,606 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018 to SEK 3,007 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The single largest new order
pertained to ventilation and sanitary installations in the new medical building in Malmö’s hospital district as well
as the LKAB relocation project in Kiruna, which together totaled SEK 342 million. Order backlog as of
December 31, 2019 increased to SEK 2,005 million, compared to SEK 1,602 million as of December 31, 2018.

_Ventilation Segment_

Net revenue of the Ventilation segment increased by 3.8%, from SEK 1,317 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018 to SEK 1,367 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, driven primarily by organic
growth and previously completed acquisitions. Increases in order intakes from SEK 1,204 million for the year
ended December 31, 2018 to SEK 1,956 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 were driven by the new
assignments in Malmö’s hospital district and the LKAB relocation project in Kiruna. Order backlog as of
December 31, 2019 increased to SEK 1,805 million, compared to SEK 1,338 million as of December 31, 2018.

_Norway Segment_

Net revenue of the Norway segment increased by 19.8%, from SEK 1,073 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018 to SEK 1,285 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, driven primarily by previously
completed acquisitions and new installation and service assignments. Increases in order intakes from
SEK 963 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to SEK 1,296 million for the year ended December 31,
2019 were driven by the new assignments that include the property at Universitetsgade 2 in Oslo
(NOK 80 million). Order backlog as of December 31, 2019 increased to SEK 1,367 million, compared to
SEK 1,097 million as of December 31, 2018.

_Finland Segment_

Net revenue of the Finland segment increased by 10.9%, from SEK 539 million for the year ended December 31,
2018 to SEK 598 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, driven by new assignments, which included
primarily small installation and service assignments. Order intake increased from SEK 472 million for the year
ended December 31, 2018 compared to SEK 492 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Order backlog
as of December 31, 2019 decreased to SEK 272 million, compared to SEK 344 million as of December 31, 2018.

**_Cost for production_**

Cost for production increased by SEK 945 million, or 13.2%, from SEK 7,186 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018 to SEK 8,131 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, driven by increases in the
installation and service assignments. The higher growth of cost of production relative to net revenue increase was
primarily related to business mix as the costs for production in the year ended December 31, 2019 was driven by
a relatively higher proportion of early-stage projects (late-stage projects typically enjoying higher margins as the
outcome becomes more certain) as well as lower amount of pass-through costs incurred (such as subcontractor
costs), compared to the same period in 2018. To a lesser extent, project write-downs in the first quarter of 2019
in Norway and Finland also contributed to the effect.

**_Sales and administrative expenses_**

Sales and administrative expenses increased by SEK 310 million, or 24.1% from SEK 1,285 million for the year
ended December 31, 2018 to SEK 1,595 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, driven by additional
white-collar labor (project managers) to support production; costs for new branch offices and acquisitions and
items affecting comparability (including impairment of rights-of-use assets) between periods, which in 2018
benefitted from a reversal of other income from settlement of a breach of warranty claim in our favor in
connection with an acquisition (SEK 25 million), while in the same period in 2019 increased due to higher costs
related to acquisitions and establishment of new branches, transformation program costs and restructuring costs.

**_Operating profit_**

Operating profit decreased by SEK 162 million, or 39.1%, from SEK 414 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018 to SEK 252 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as increases in the growth in cost
for production and sales and administrative expenses were in excess of the increase in net revenue. The decrease
in operating profit was offset by a slight increase in operating profit resulting from the net effect of the
application of IFRS 16 from January 1, 2019.

**_Net financial items_**

Net financial items improved by SEK 73 million, or 37.8%, from negative SEK 193 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018 to negative SEK 120 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The change in net
financial items and other financial expenses was attributable to refinancing shareholder loans into bank loans

-----

with better financial terms, as a result of the refinancing at the end of 2018. Net financial items were also
positively impacted by a dividend from the partially owned company Elajo in the second quarter. Capitalized
arrangement fees from refinanced bank loans impacted both 2019 and 2018 due to the refinancing with the
proceeds from the issue of the Original Notes in 2019, as well as the refinancing of shareholder loans in each of
the respective quarters.

**_Tax for the year_**

Tax for the period amounted to SEK 77 million and SEK 40 million in the years ended December 31, 2018 and
2019, respectively, corresponding to 35.0% and 30.1% of profit before tax of SEK 220 million and
SEK 133 million for the respective periods.

**_Profit for the period_**

Profit for the year decreased by SEK 51 million from SEK 143 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to
SEK 92 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, due to the factors described above.

**_Adjusted EBITA and margins_**

Our Adjusted EBITA for the period increased from SEK 401 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to
SEK 516 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which is an increase of 28.7%, while Adjusted EBITA
Margin was 4.5% and 5.2% in the respective periods. Earnings and profitability for the period were negatively
impacted in 2019 by the first-quarter project write-downs in Norway and Finland totaling SEK 23 million, but
they recovered in subsequent quarters, including due to the number of cost saving initiatives and operational
efficiency measures to improve profitability that were launched in the fourth quarter.

Adjusted EBITA for the Electrical segment increased by 34.5% from SEK 165 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018 to SEK 222 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, while the Adjusted EBITA
Margin also improved from 4.6% to 5.3% over the same period.

For the Heating and Sanitation segment, Adjusted EBITA increased by 29.9% from SEK 107 million for the year
ended December 31, 2018 to SEK 139 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to previously
completed acquisitions with good profitability, while the Adjusted EBITA Margin also improved from 4.5% to
5.3% over the same period.

Adjusted EBITA for the Ventilation segment remained stable at SEK 73 million and SEK 73 million for the
years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively, while Adjusted EBITA Margin declined from 5.5% to
5.3%. The difference year-on-year is attributable in part to costs related to the start-up of large new projects with
limited material content in early phases and conservative margins, as well as comparability with the strong
completion of two large projects in the first quarter of 2018.

In the Norway segment, weaker profitability in the first quarter of the year (due to the project write-downs
mentioned above) experienced robust recovery in subsequent quarters. Adjusted EBITA for the period declined
slightly from SEK 71 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to SEK 70 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019, while the Adjusted EBITA Margin also declined from 6.6% to 5.4% over the same period.

Adjusted EBITA for the Finland segment increased slightly from SEK 11 million to SEK 12 million, while the
Adjusted EBITA Margin remained stable at 2.0% and 2.0% in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019,
respectively.

**_Net revenue_**

Net revenue increased by SEK 716 million, or 8.8%, from SEK 8,169 million for the year ended December 31,
2017 to SEK 8,885 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Of the total growth, 6.9% consisted of organic
growth and the remainder was due to acquisitions. Organic growth was driven in part by a stable inflow of
smaller and medium-sized local assignment and in part by larger assignments. Interest in multi-tech assignments
and partnering projects grew in major procurements, which is favorable for major providers of complete service
and installation solutions like Assemblin. Sales rose in all segments, primarily in Norway and Ventilation. Order
intake for the period decreased year-on-year to SEK 9,459 million for the year ended December 31, 2018,
compared to SEK 9,899 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, while order backlog increased from
SEK 6,223 million as of December 31, 2017 to SEK 6,971 million as of December 31, 2018. Among the large
new contract assignments announced during 2018 were a large proportion of multi-tech assignments, including
the first phase of New Hospital District (NSM) in Malmö, the renovation of Sollentuna Hospital and a housing
project in the Västra Hamnen district of Malmö.

_Electrical Segment_

Net revenue of the Electrical segment was stable, at SEK 3,559 million and SEK 3,592 million, respectively for
the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018. Major projects in 2018 included the ESS research facility in Lund,
the Patienten hospital construction in Stockholm, the terminal expansion at Landvetter Airport, the C4 Shopping
center in Kristianstad and Hubben in Uppsala Science Park. As of December 31, 2018, order backlog amounted
to SEK 2,590 million compared to SEK 2,026 million as of December 31, 2017.

_Heating and Sanitation Segment_

Net revenue of the Heating and Sanitation segment increased by 5.9%, from SEK 2,256 million for the year
ended December 31, 2017 to SEK 2,388 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Growth was greatest in
servicing, which grew 16.5% year-on-year. Ongoing larger projects included student housing at Campus Albano
in Stock-holm, residences at Parken 2 in Lund, the new Geely main office in Gothenburg, the conversion of the
Patienten hospital building in Stockholm and the terminal expansion at Landveter Airport. Order backlog as of
December 31, 2018 increased to SEK 1,602 million, compared to SEK 1,381 million as of December 31, 2017.

_Ventilation Segment_

Net revenue of the Ventilation segment increased by 22.9%, from SEK 1,072 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017 to SEK 1,317 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, driven primarily by organic
growth and, to a lesser extent, completed acquisitions. Increased order intake was driven by the new assignments
in Malmö’s hospital district. Larger ongoing projects included the Högland hospital in Eksjö, the Gäddorna

98


-----

office and residential properties in Malmö and the Chopin and Solletuna Sjukhus hostpital projects in Stockholm,
as well as new service assignment with Skandiafastigheter. Order backlog as of December 31, 2018 decreased to
SEK 1,338 million, compared to SEK 1,527 million as of December 31, 2017.

_Norway Segment_

Net revenue of the Norway segment increased by 25.4%, from SEK 856 million for the year ended December 31,
2017 to SEK 1,073 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, driven primarily by organic growth. The
largest ongoing projects are the new office at Orkla, Tønsberg hospital project, the Tomtebrygga B1 hotel and
residential property, the HSM Doyén residential district in the greater Oslo area. Order backlog as of
December 31, 2018 increased to SEK 1,097 million, compared to SEK 965 million as of December 31, 2017.

_Finland Segment_

Net revenue of the Finland segment increased by 9.6%, from SEK 492 million for the year ended December 31,
2017 to SEK 539 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, driven by translation effects and organic growth
offsetting the effect of discontinued pipeline renovation operations. Order backlog as of December 31, 2018
increased to SEK 344 million, compared to SEK 324 million as of December 31, 2017.

**_Cost for production_**

Cost for production increased by SEK 520 million, or 7.8%, from SEK 6,666 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017 to SEK 7,186 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, driven by increases in the
installation and service assignments.

**_Sales and administrative expenses_**

Sales and administrative expenses decreased by SEK 103 million, or 7.4%, from SEK 1,388 million for the year
ended December 31, 2017 to SEK 1,285 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Cost reductions were
driven by continual focus on overhead costs, reduced costs after the successful integration of Skanska Installation
as well as a reduction in items affecting comparability (including impairment of rights-of-use assets) between
periods, which were elevated in 2017 due to the costs related to the integration of Skanska Installation and
internal restructuring costs.

**_Operating profit_**

Operating profit increased by SEK 299 million, or 260.0%, from SEK 115 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017 to SEK 414 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The improvement in earnings is
generally a result of management’s efforts on reversing the trend in less profitable divisions, more structured
monitoring and better project control.

**_Net financial items_**

Net financial items deteriorated by SEK 51 million, or 35.9%, from negative SEK 142 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017 to negative SEK 193 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 driven mainly by
refinancing activity and the capitalized arrangement fees related to previous financing arrangements being
expensed, partly offset by a lower interest expense.

**_Tax for the year_**

We recognized a net tax benefit in the year ended December 31, 2017 of SEK 50 million, as current tax expense
for the year was more than offset by the deferred tax loss carry-forwards. Tax for the year was SEK 77 million
for the year ended December 31, 2018, amounting to 35.0% of the profit before tax of SEK 220 million for the
period.

**_Profit for the period_**

Profit for the year increased by SEK 121 million from SEK 22 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to
SEK 143 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, due to the factors described above.

-----

**_Adjusted EBITA and margins_**

Adjusted EBITA for the full year enjoyed a robust increase, rising 59.8% from SEK 251 million for the year
ended December 31, 2017 to SEK 401 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Adjusted EBITA
Margin improved from 3.1% to 4.5% over the same periods. The improvement in earnings is generally an effect
of conscious work on reversing the trend in less profitable divisions, more structured monitoring and better
project control. Profitability increased significantly in all segments.

Adjusted EBITA for the Electrical segment increased by 60.2% from SEK 103 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017 to SEK 165 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, while the Adjusted EBITA
Margin improved from 2.9% to 4.6% over the same period.

For the Heating and Sanitation segment, Adjusted EBITA increased by 67.2% from SEK 64 million for the year
ended December 31, 2017 to SEK 107 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 while the Adjusted EBITA
Margin also improved from 2.8% to 4.5% over the same period.

Adjusted EBITA for the Ventilation segment grew significantly, increasing 46% from SEK 50 million for the
year ended December 31, 2017 to SEK 73 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, while Adjusted EBITA
Margin improved from 4.7% to 5.5% over the same period, partly due to strong completion for two of the
projects in the first quarter of 2018.

The Norway segment produced the strongest profitability. Adjusted EBITA for the period increasing strongly by
29% from SEK 55 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to SEK 71 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018, while Adjusted EBITA Margin improved from 6.4% to 6.6% over the same period.

The Finland segment reported positive earnings for the first time in several years, with Adjusted EBITA
improving to SEK 11 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and Adjusted EBITA Margin of 2.0% from
a loss of SEK 15 million in the prior year.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

“Liquidity” describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flow to meet the cash requirements of
its business operations, including but not limited to working capital needs, capital expenditures, debt service
obligations, contractual obligations and acquisitions. Our primary uses of liquidity are to meet our debt service
obligations, to fund capital expenditures and selected bolt-on acquisitions and to fund changes in working capital.
Our primary sources of liquidity are provided by cash generated from our operating activities, our leasing
facilities which we utilize primarily to fund vehicle purchases, and further supplemented by amounts drawn
under the Revolving Credit Facility. We expect to draw on the Revolving Credit Facility to service our working
capital needs and for other general corporate purposes. Borrowings and availability under the Revolving Credit
Facility will be subject to certain conditions precedent, including compliance with financial maintenance and
other covenants and representations and warranties. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—The
_Super Senior Facilities.” Additionally, in connection with the Fidelix Acquisition, we expect the Sponsor to_
contribute €20 million (or approximately SEK 210 million) in cash on or about the Completion Date in the form
of an equity contribution.

Although we believe that our expected cash flow from operating activities will be adequate to meet our expected
liquidity needs, including our debt service obligations, we cannot assure you that our business will generate
sufficient cash flow from operations to meet these needs or that future debt or equity financing will be available
to us in an amount sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including making payments on the Notes or on our
other debt when due. If our cash flow from operating activities is lower than expected, we may be required to
seek additional financing, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Our ability to
arrange financing generally and our cost of capital depend on numerous factors, including general economic
conditions, the availability of credit from banks, other financial institutions and capital markets, restrictions in
the instruments governing our debt and our general financial performance. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to
_Our Financial Profile—Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations may make it difficult for us to_
_fulfill our obligations under the Notes and operate our business” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our_
_Financial Profile—We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, including due to_
_factors outside our control, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our_
_indebtedness, which may not be successful.”_

**Cash Flow**

provisions), changes in doubtful trade receivables, changes in accrued interest, capital gain/loss from fixed assets and other items.
For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, comprised primarily depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets,
capitalized interest, expensed arrangement fees in respect of bank loans and pension provisions. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2019 and the year ended December 31, 2019, comprised primarily depreciation and amortization of tangible and
intangible assets and provisions (including pension provisions). For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, comprised primarily
depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets, provisions (including pension provisions) and changes in doubtful trade
receivables .

**Cash Flow from Operating Activities**

Cash inflow from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 increased by
SEK 307 million from SEK 102 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to SEK 409 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily as a result of higher profitability and inflows from changes
in working capital. Although the first nine months of the year typically show adverse working capital
development, compared to the year-end position, due to seasonal factors (see “—Key Factors Affecting Our
_Results of Operations—Seasonality”), working capital requirements were positively impacted by improved_
invoicing practices.

Cash inflow from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased by SEK 31 million, or
6.0%, from SEK 516 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to SEK 485 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019. Higher profitability in 2019 was more than offset by changes in working capital. The net
cash inflow in 2018 due to changes in working capital was positively impacted by significant management efforts
to improve incentives for decreasing working capital requirements at branch level and overall improved
invoicing practices in 2018, while 2019 did not feature the same level of working capital release.

Cash inflow from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased significantly by
SEK 424 million, from SEK 92 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to SEK 516 million for the year
ended December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of higher profitability and inflows from changes in working
capital. Net cash flow from changes in working capital reversed from a net outflow of SEK 140 million
(comprising a decrease in inventory of SEK 8 million, an increase in operating receivables of SEK 269 million
and a decrease in operating liabilities of SEK 401 million) in the year ended December 31, 2017, as Skanska
Installation benefitted from large prepayments prior to the completion of our acquisition of this business, which
did not recur in 2018, to a net cash inflow of SEK 116 million (comprising an increase in inventory of
SEK 11 million, a decrease in operating receivables of SEK 90 million and an increase in operating liabilities of
SEK 195 million) in the year ended December 31, 2018, which was the result of management efforts to improve
incentives for decreasing working capital requirements at branch level and overall improved invoicing practices
in 2018.

**Cash Flow from Investment Activities**

Cash outflow from investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 increased by
SEK 70 million, from an outflow of SEK 88 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to an outflow
of SEK 158 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily as a result of increased acquisition
activity in 2020, with cash outflows related to acquisition of subsidiaries increasing from SEK 103 million to
SEK 152 million period-on-period, reflecting our accelerated mergers and acquisition strategy.

103


-----

Cash outflow from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by SEK 109 million,
from an outflow of SEK 88 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to an outflow of SEK 197 million for
the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of increased acquisition activity in 2019, with cash
outflows related to acquisition of subsidiaries increasing from SEK 63 million to SEK 211 million
period-on-period, reflecting our accelerated mergers and acquisition strategy.

Cash outflow from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by SEK 86 million, from
an outflow of SEK 2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to an outflow of SEK 88 million for the year
ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to acquisitions and purchases of vehicle fleet as we built out our
servicing capabilities.

**Cash Flow from Financing Activities**

Cash outflow from financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 were
SEK 139 million and SEK 125 million, respectively, in each case, the entirety of which (other than
SEK 2 million in respect of loan repayments in the nine months ended September 30, 2020) is attributable to
repayments of finance leases, increasing due to IFRS 16.

Cash outflow from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was SEK 297 million, reflecting
the refinancing of our then outstanding loan facilities (raising SEK 2,591 million, primarily from the issuance of
the Original Notes, and repayments of SEK 2,717 million, including refinancing fees and expenses). Cash
outflow from financing activities during this period also reflected SEK 170 million of repayments of finance
leases, increasing due to IFRS 16.

Cash outflow from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was SEK 442 million, as we
completed substantial refinancing of our then outstanding loan facilities, raising SEK 1,700 million in new loan
proceeds, and with repayments together with refinancing fees and expenses amounting to SEK 2,033 million
using new external financing and cash on balance sheet.

Cash outflow from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was SEK 92 million, which was
due to loan repayments and repayments of finance leases related to our car fleet.

**Capital Expenditures and Finance Leases**

We define Net Capital Expenditures as investments in intangible and tangible fixed assets, less the sales value
(cash proceeds) of tangible and intangible fixed assets for the period, and including net leasing expenditures
related to vehicles, which primarily relate to our car fleet. See “Presentation of Financial and Other
_Information—Presentation_ _of_ _Financial_ _Information—Non-IFRS_ _Measures”_ and “Summary—Summary
_Combined Financial and Other Information—Operating Data and Non-IFRS Financial Information.” We define_
“sales value” to be disposal of property, plant and equipment in the cash flow statement, “investments in
intangible fixed assets” to be acquisitions of intangible assets in the cash flow statement and “investments in
tangible fixed assets” to be acquisitions of property, plant and equipment in the cash flow statement. Total Net
Capital Expenditure amounted to SEK 95 million, SEK 163 million and SEK 120 million in the years ended
December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively, and SEK 87 million and SEK 51 million in the nine months
ended September 30, 2019 and 2020, respectively.

Most of our total Net Capital Expenditures (SEK 85 million, SEK 136 million and SEK 116 million for the fiscal
years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively, SEK 84 million and SEK 45 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2019 and 2020, respectively) is related to our vehicle leases, which we finance
using finance lease facilities with local banks. Excluding capital expenditures related to vehicle leases, our
operations require very limited capital expenditure, primarily comprising expenditures on tools, refurbishment
and IT. Net Capital Expenditures before vehicle leases amounted to SEK 9 million, SEK 27 million and
SEK 4 million in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively, and SEK 3 million and
SEK 6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2020, respectively.

**Working Capital Requirements**

We do not currently have significant short-term or long-term working capital requirements, because we typically
receive payments under our installation contracts prior to paying costs related thereto. These prepayment

104


-----

arrangements, along with personnel-related costs (primarily vacation salary), result in our negative working
capital position for installation projects. In our services contracts, Net Working Capital requirements are
generally positive, as these rely less on subcontractors and materials purchased, and feature higher costs related
to our own personnel. Customer invoices are typically not drawn until work has been completed.

Our working capital requirements are also seasonal. See “—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—
_Seasonality.”_

**Pensions obligations**

Some of our white-collar employees in Sweden are covered by a defined benefit pension plan, which is
accounted for in accordance with IAS 19 under which we are required to provide agreed benefits to current and
former employees. Other employees have pensions that are recognized as defined-contribution.

As of December 31, 2019, approximately 30% of our employees had defined benefit pensions. Of these, the
Swedish plan for electricity white-collar employees is recognized as defined-benefit for purposes of our financial
statements, and is unfunded and based on final salary, which provides employees with benefits in the form of a
guaranteed level of pension disbursements over their lifetimes. For the remaining white-collar employees in
Sweden the defined-benefit pension obligations are secured through insurance with Alecta. For the financial year
ended December 31, 2019, we did not have access to information that would make it possible to recognize this
plan as a defined-benefit plan. The pension plan secured through insurance with Alecta is therefore recognized as
a defined-contribution plan. Annual fees for pension insurance contracted with Alecta totaled SEK 55.5 million,
SEK 51.5 million and SEK 50 million, in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Alecta’s surplus can be allocated to policy holders and/or the insured.

Pension scheme liabilities vary with changes to long-term interest rates, inflation, pensionable salaries and the
longevity of scheme members. During the periods under review, liabilities in respect of provisions for pensions
increased from SEK 483 million as of December 31, 2017, to SEK 560 million as of December 31, 2018, to SEK
703 million as of December 31, 2019 before decreasing slightly to SEK 690 million as of September 30, 2020,
with increases driven primarily by a decline in market interest rates, which resulted in the assumed discount rate
for defined-benefit obligations decreasing from 2.57% as of December 31, 2017 to 2.40% as of December 31,
2018 to 1.40% as of December 31, 2019 and 1.38% at September 30, 2019. The increase in liabilities in respect
of provisions for pensions also reflects the relatively greater proportion of plan participants that are not eligible
for retirement, as compared to the number of former plan participants that have retired.

See Note 8 to the Audited Combined Financial Statements for further information as to our pensions obligations
and pensions costs.

105


-----

In accordance with the requirements of the pension administrator, we are required to provide bank guarantees in
respect of a portion of the Group’s defined-benefit pensions obligations. We have been required to increase the
amount of our current SEK 240 million bank guarantee (incurred under the Pension Guarantee Facility) by SEK
45 million, which additional amount was initially incurred under the Guarantee Facility. We expect to ultimately
incur the full SEK 285 million under the Pension Guarantee Facility once we have increased the SEK 240 million
of aggregate commitments thereunder by SEK 45 million, as permitted under the terms of the Pension Guarantee
Facility Agreement to reflect increased guarantee requirements by the pension administrator (and to cancel the
amount initially incurred under the Guarantee Facility). Our obligations with respect to the Pension Guarantee
Facility and the Guarantee Facility are secured on the Collateral on a super senior basis to the Original Notes and
the Additional Notes. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—The Super Senior Facilities.”
Availability of the additional guarantee amounts under the Pensions Guarantee Facility or the Guarantee Facility,
however, is subject to certain conditions, including compliance with certain financial covenants.

**Contractual commitments and contingencies**

Our contractual commitments comprise primarily our contractual obligations to perform work invoiced, but not
yet completed and warranty commitments, which related to assumed expenditures in the future for rectifying
errors and shortcomings regarding concluded projects that arise during the warranty period for the projects. See
Notes 24 and 25 to the Audited Combined Financial Statements for further information regarding provisions
related to these liabilities. Prior to January 1, 2018 and the adoption of IFRS 16, contractual commitments also
included leases classified as operating leases in accordance with IAS 17. See “—Accounting Standards Adopted
_During the Period.”_

In connection with our operations, we are required to provide a certain number of commitments in terms of
performance guarantees for completion of work, guarantees of customer advances and parent company
guarantees. As of September 30, 2020, performance guarantees amounted to SEK 464 million, SEK 55 million
was provided under the Guarantee Facility, and the remainder of which are provided principally by insurance
companies on an unsecured basis as well as commercial banks.

We also have additional variable cash consideration of up to approximately SEK 160 million payable over the
next three years in respect of acquisitions undertaken by the Group as of the date hereof.

**Risk Management**

We are exposed to various types of risks, both operational and financial. Operational risks are associated with
day-to-day operations relating to economic activity, tendering, capacity utilization, price risks and revenue
recognition. Financial risks arise from the amount of capital tied up and our capital requirements. We believe we
are exposed to greater operational risks than financial risks.

**Financial Risk Management**

In our installation business risks are asymmetric. In any given project, the chances of exceeding the expected
outcome during the term of the project are limited while there is a risk of incurring significant losses in relation
to the size of the project. The management of operational risks is a continuous process covering a large number
of ongoing projects and service assignments. We have designed several methods to ensure that operational risks
remain under control. We believe our systematic work on quality and environmental issues as well as
occupational health and safety issues are key building blocks that underpin our management systems. Our
financial risks are managed centrally for the purpose of minimizing and controlling our risk exposure while credit
risks are managed locally at each of our profit centers.

**Operational Risks**

**Economic Activity**

Fluctuations in the economy affect the building services sector, which is sensitive to market fluctuations and
political decisions that can have an impact on demand for residential and commercial new builds and investments
in industry and the public sector. Demand for service and maintenance work is less sensitive to fluctuations in the
economy.

106


-----

**Tendering**

An installation and service company is exposed to commercial and production-related risks, which need to be
identified and managed during the tendering process. To ensure that this is done, we have implemented process
descriptions and checklists that are aimed at identifying and pricing the risks in our cost estimates and tenders.

**Capacity Utilization**

Capacity utilization is heavily dependent on demand in our geographic markets. An unforeseen decline in
capacity utilization generally results in a loss of revenue, which in the short term cannot be offset by a
corresponding cost reduction. We seek to mitigate these risks through continuous resource planning, including
redundancies if order backlog does not support current local staffing levels and by employing subcontractors
during periods of peak production.

**Price Risks**

Unforeseen variations in input prices and prices charged by subcontractors constitute a risk. We seek to offset the
risk of rising prices through the use of contract forms that are appropriate for the project, indexation for fixedprice agreements and efficient purchasing procedures.

**Insurance**

We believe we have adequate insurance coverage for our operations, comprising liability, contract and property
insurance.

**Internal Controls**

Our Board acts as the ultimate source of internal controls. Our Board has delegated to senior management the
establishment and implementation of a system of internal controls appropriate to our business. These controls
include the safeguarding of assets; the maintenance of proper accounting records; the reliability of financial
information; and compliance with appropriate legislation, regulation and best practice.

Our operations are decentralized and governed based on a shared framework, clear allocation of roles and
responsibilities and systematic monitoring. Our branch managers are continuously supported and monitored at
the regional, business area Group level to ensure appropriate risk managed and improved profitability. This
support is carried out by, among other things, project selection controls and project execution controls.

Management and administration are performed at the branch level by our branch-level managers at over 160 of
our local branch offices in over 100 locations throughout the Nordic region. Our branch-level managers report to
their respective regional manager who in turn reports to the Business Area manager who together with the CEO,
CFO and Head of Communication form senior executive management. Each of our branches consists of, and is
responsible for, one or more profit centers. We characterize our profit centers as either installation profit centers
or service profit centers, based on the predominant operations conducted by the applicable profit center.

In relation to project selection, tenders are approved based on project size, assuming standard contractual terms.
Projects under €1 million can be approved directly by the branch office, with projects between €1 million to
€2 million and €2 million to €5 million required to be approved at the region and business area level,
respectively. Projects between €5 million to €10 million must be approved at the Group level and contracts over
€10 million are required to be approved by our Board. With respect to project execution, branches are supported
by an established system of financial, internal and management controls.

**Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements**

**_Recognition of revenue over time_**

The reported earnings in ongoing contract projects are recognized over time on the basis of assignment
expenditures incurred in relation to the total estimated assignment fees of the assignment. Costs associated with
this are recognized in earnings as they arise. This requires reliable calculation of project revenue and project
costs. The precondition is a properly functioning system for cost accounting, forecasting processes and project
monitoring. The forecast regarding the project’s final outcome is a critical judgement that is material to the
operating report over the course of the project. There may be a risk that the final result as regards the project
could deviate from what is gradually reported.

107


-----

**_Pensions_**

We have partial defined-benefit pension plans. The pension obligations are calculated used actuarial
assumptions, and plan assets are marked to market on the balance-sheet date. A change in any of these
assumptions and measurements could have a significant impact on calculated pension commitments and pension
cost.

**_Intangible assets_**

_Impairment testing of goodwill_

The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units is based on the assumption of future conditions and estimates
of various parameters. Changes in these assumptions and estimates could have an effect on the carrying amount
of goodwill. A recession in the rate of growth and operating margin would yield a lower recoverable amount. The
reverse applies if the recoverable amount were calculated based on a higher rate of growth or margin. If future
cash flows are discounted at a higher interest rate, the recoverable amount would be lower. The reverse would
apply if the recoverable amount were to rise in conjunction with discounting at a lower discount rate.

**_Warranty provisions_**

We make warranty provisions are made for the warranty obligations found in the contract assignments being
performed. A warranty expenditure arises in a project when a Group company performs extra work as a result of
shortcomings that emerged in the original contract, in work performed or in materials. A warranty reserve is
calculated based on the probable costs of correcting the faults that arose in the contract. The scope of the
warranty provision is established based on:

Š previous experiences in similar projects;

Š the anticipated scope of the extra work; and

Š the estimated cost.

**_Onerous leases_**

When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is immediately
recognized as an expense in its entirety. An onerous lease is a contract in which the unavoidable costs for
meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the anticipated financial benefits. The expected loss is
immediately recognized as a cost in its entirety.

**INDUSTRY**

**Overview**

The Nordic installation market, which comprises the combined installation markets of Sweden, Norway and
Finland, is a highly fragmented market and accounted for 35% of the overall Nordic construction market, at
SEK 231 billion aggregate spend in 2019 according to Prognoscentret.

The installation market can be segmented into two categories: (i) new-build installations and (ii) renovation,
maintenance and services of existing installations. Because the Nordic construction market is mature, most of the
activity is driven by renovation, maintenance and services of existing installations, rather than new-build.

Š **_New-build installations represent about 29% (comprising 13.0% residential and 16.3% non-residential) of_**
the Nordic installation market.

Demand for new-build installation results generally from the demand for new-build construction and has
therefore been sensitive historically to macroeconomic factors such as GDP growth, interest rates and realestate prices among other factors, although with a slight time lag owing to the downstream nature of the
activity (installation occurring at the end of the construction process of a building). Although the new
construction segment is generally cyclical, significant local and regional variations within different
countries influence end-market exposure. It is also worth noting that public sector spendings have
historically exhibited less volatility compared to the residential and commercial construction sectors,
primarily because government spending in the Nordic region have historically been increased during
economic downturns.

Due to disruptions to economic activity caused by COVID-19, new construction activity in the near term is
expected to experience some slowdown as projected by Euroconstruct in their report published in November
2020. However, the Group has limited exposure to markets expected to experience the sharpest contraction,
such as new residential construction. Moreover, as a leading player with scale and a track record of
execution excellence in a fragmented market, the Group is well positioned relative to the small- and
medium-sized players to navigate the crisis and to potentially gain market share.

Š **_Renovation, maintenance and services represent about 71% (comprising 26.2% service, 24.8%_**
non-residential and 19.6% residential) of the Nordic installation market.

Demand for maintenance has generally shown a higher level of stability compared to new-build and, similar
to renovation, is largely driven by the age and composition of the buildings. During economic downturns,
customers have a demonstrated preference for renovation and maintenance as opposed to new construction,
which has traditionally resulted in countercyclical effects in the renovation and maintenance segment.
Expenditures on renovation and maintenance are more flexibly managed and constitute part of a customer’s
general operating expenses, making them less susceptible to reductions in customer spending and resulting
in stable revenue flow for service providers. Moreover, demand for renovation and maintenance is primarily
driven by the age and composition of real estate.

The resilience of the renovation market has been highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as the
construction market for renovation is expected to sustain stable growth in the near term as projected by
Euroconstruct.

The Nordic installation market can also be segmented by activity into: (i) Electrical; (ii) Heating and Sanitation
and (iii) Ventilation.

Š **_Electrical is one of the largest installation market segments, worth SEK 101 billion, according to_**
Prognoscentret, and accounting for 44% of the overall installation market. Renovation, maintenance and
service accounts for 73% of the Electrical segment, with non-residential renovation and maintenance being
the largest building type segment. It includes the installation of wiring and fittings, lighting systems, street
lighting, electrical signs, airport runway lighting, satellite dishes, alarms, solar energy collectors and
connecting of electronic appliances, as well as their maintenance and repair.

Š **_Heating and Sanitation accounts for 42% of the Nordic installation market and is worth SEK 98 billion._**
Renovation, maintenance and service accounts for 72% of the Heating and Sanitation segment, with
residential renovation and maintenance being the largest building type segment. It includes the installation
of plumbing and heating systems, as well as their maintenance and repair.

Š **_Ventilation: Ventilation market is the smallest installation market segment, accounting for 14% of the_**
Nordic installation market. 61% of the Ventilation market is renovation, maintenance and service, with
service being the largest segment. It includes the installation of ventilation and air-conditioning systems, as
well as their maintenance and repair.

109


-----

Some activities are regulated, and our technicians and engineers (in particular plumbers and electricians) are
required to be certified. This creates staff scarcity in some market segments, in particular in the Electrical and
Heating and Sanitation segments. Larger companies such as the Group are perceived as more stable and offering
greater career opportunities to staff in the long- term. The Group is therefore well placed to benefit from the
barriers to entry stemming from certification requirements.

**Market size and outlook**

The Nordic renovation and maintenance and service market is expected to exhibit steady growth, even excluding
the impact from inflation while some near term headwind is expected in the new-build market.

The following table sets forth the historical and forecast evolution of the size of the various market segments
within the Nordic installation market for the years indicated.

Note:
(1) Market data excludes inflation.

The acquisition of Fidelix increases our exposure to the rapidly growing building automation markets of building
management systems (“BMS”) and individual metering and debiting (“IMD”). These end-markets have grown
above the rest of the installation market and are expected to continue to do so in the medium- to long-term. The
factors driving the robust market growth include energy efficiency, sustainability, cloud computing and IoT,
tightening regulation, increase in energy prices and focus on indoor climate. Moreover the scope of activities and
services for Fidelix is continuously expanding driven by advancements in technology in machine learning,
automated diagnostics and smarter building automation systems. These macro drivers also result in a high level
of cycle resilience as was seen during the financial crisis of 2008-09 and in the COVID impacted markets of
2020.

**Secular growth drivers**

Beyond macroeconomic and cycle considerations, several structural growth trends within the Nordic installation
market support long-term market growth. These include:

Š **_Energy efficiency: Increasing demand for energy efficient systems in buildings, driven by economic,_**
environmental and regulatory pressures, provide significant growth opportunities, wherein installation
solutions can be customized to each building to achieve low energy use. Stimulus programs introduced by
various national governments and the EU to kick start recovery from the current economic slowdown are
expected to help accelerate this trend as a number of these stimulus programs are specifically targeted or
focused on the Green agenda. Examples include Sweden’s SEK 9.7 billion proposal for investments in green
recovery initiatives in the Budget Bill for 2021, the EU’s €500 billion green stimulus package passed in July
2020, Norway’s May 2020 proposal to spend €360 million to support a greener economy and the EIB’s
€150 million in financing for new near-zero-energy buildings and renovation investments to improve energy
efficiency of existing buildings in the Helsinki metropolitan area;

Š **_Growing demand for more advanced technology systems: Increasingly tech-heavy properties require more_**
advanced technology systems, with a higher demand for IoT, energy efficient systems and security system
automatization offering several growth avenues;

Š **_Increasing pace of urbanization: Increased inflow of inhabitants in Nordic cities increases the need for new_**
residential buildings and public properties while also placing greater requirements on safer and more
efficient and modern premises;

Š **_Higher degree of digitalization: Growing digitalization creates new requirements for managing data and_**
allows for the creation of new technical installations to monitor and optimize energy efficiency while also
driving greater demand for service due to increased complexity of technical installations and systems;

110


-----

Š **_Partnering projects: New forms of close collaboration between various parties in the construction process_**
increases the importance of coordination of installations while also enabling greater efficiency in the
production process and energy usage through multi-tech procurements; and

Š **_Greater need for renovation in ageing buildings: A significant portion of the Nordic building stock is of_**
considerable age prompting an upcoming renovation wave for buildings from the 1970s and 1980s and also
driven by the potential to reduce energy usage in Sweden through renovations in existing building stock.

**Competitive landscape**

The Nordic installation market is highly fragmented, and competition is largely focused on a contract by contract
basis at a local level. As a result, the Group rarely competes against larger pan-Nordic players such as Bravida,
Instalco, Caverion, GK or Kemp & Lauritzen but rather against local small or medium-sized enterprises
(“SMEs”), such as ELEffekt, Robmac and Stockholms Elektriska.

However, we believe that customers demand an increasingly broad range of services and expertise from
installation services providers, including a single point of contact for delivery of integrated solutions, in order to
optimize their procurement process. Many SMEs specialize in a particular activity and regional area but are
unable to offer “one-stop shop” solutions. This offers a potential advantage of larger groups and has led to the
consolidation of small, local businesses over the years which is a trend we expect will continue.

This is particularly true for larger projects which are generally awarded on price, but also on some qualitative
factors such as breadth and depth of services, technical know-how, ability to deliver tailored, state-of-the-art
solutions across multiple fields of technology, which tend to play well to the advantage of larger players. Scale
itself is a differentiating factor as SMEs are unlikely to have the financial strength to undertake large, lengthy
projects.

Moreover, as customers increasingly evaluate the value position of service providers in terms of ongoing
performance of installed equipment, technological competence is becoming particularly important. The Group
has maintained a clear strategic focus on technologies and digital systems and Fidelix’s technology-driven focus
will help solidify the Group’s positioning, particularly in one of the most attractive niches of the installation
services market that caters to building automation. As a fully integrated player in this market, Fidelix faces
competition from different parts of the value chain. Competitors include large industrial goods players such as
Schneider and Siemens which are the only players bigger than Fidelix in its focus markets of Finland and
Sweden. However, unlike Schneider and Siemens which are only focused on large projects, Fidelix is able to
cover a wider installed base creating upselling and aftermarket sales opportunities, references and expertise
across building types and deeper visibility into market outlook. Fidelix has been able to build on this further with
its established position, open system and competitive pricing to capture market share as has been consistently
seen historically and expected to continue forward.

Local contracts tend to be of smaller size and often awarded based on customer relationships with managers at
local branches, in addition to price considerations. It is therefore critical to empower staff locally so that they are
incentivized to develop not only customer relationships and intimacy, but also raise brand awareness and
maximize talent acquisition. Network density and customer proximity can create cost and service quality
leadership which a one-branch competitor would not benefit from.

**BUSINESS**

**Overview**

We are one of the Nordic region’s leading providers of complete installation and service solutions, with our
primary activities focusing on electrical engineering, heating and sanitation, ventilation and automation, as well
as key competencies in data and telecom, industrial pipes, district heating, cooling, sprinklers, security and
electrical workshop and field services. We hold a strong position in the growing installation market in the Nordic
region (comprising Sweden, Norway and Finland), which are estimated at approximately SEK 98 billion, SEK
75 billion and SEK 59 billion, respectively, and have a combined approximate value of SEK 231 billion as of
December 31, 2019, and in 2019, we had the second largest share of Sweden’s installation market by revenue
according to Prognoscentret. Moreover, in December 2020, we entered into a sale and purchase agreement to
acquire Fidelix, a technology-driven building automation service company, which is expected to provide us with
a market-leading position within the building automation market in the Nordics.

We provide installation and service assignments in various types of properties, industrial facilities and
infrastructure projects for a diverse customer base consisting over 20,000 large and small customers, which
include construction companies, the public sector, property owners and industrial companies. Our strong
relationships with our customers have contributed to an order backlog of SEK 8,245 million and an LTM order
intake of SEK 9,859 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2020, and we currently have over 3,000 ongoing
projects. We take on primarily two types of assignments: contractor assignments and service assignments. The
proportion of contractor assignments and service assignments represented 60% and 40%, respectively, of our net
revenue for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020.

Our operations are decentralized and governed based on a shared framework, clear allocation of roles and
responsibilities and systematic monitoring. Our current operating organization is divided into five specific
business areas: three in Sweden (Assemblin El, Assemblin VS and Assemblin Ventilation), one in Norway
(Assemblin Norway) and one in Finland (Assemblin Finland), comprising over 166 branches across over 100
locations with over 5,800 employees in the Nordic region. We believe that our decentralized business model
contributes to the profitability of our operations. This decentralized and entrepreneurial business model allows us
to swiftly adjust to a largely variable cost structure and promotes enterprise and accountability at all levels of our
structure with the president of each business area being responsible, together with their management groups, for
the operations and earnings in their respective business areas.

The following map shows the branch footprint of our business areas, representing the locations in which we
operated in the Nordic region as of September 30, 2020.

We have been owned by Triton Partners since 2015, and since then have expanded our geographical presence and
volumes through the acquisition of 40 additional companies to date (excluding Fidelix), the largest of which
being a carve-out from construction company Skanska, Skanska Installation, acquired in 2016. Our organic and

112


-----

inorganic growth has made us into a complete installation and service partner, with the strength of a
multidisciplinary group and the personal presence of a local company.

In the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, we had total net revenue of SEK 10,133 million, a net profit for
the period of SEK 42 million, EBITA of SEK 304 million, Adjusted EBITA of SEK 569 million and Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA of SEK 851 million. This was supported by our strong order backlog, which stood at
SEK 8,245 million as of September 30, 2020.

The table below sets out the net revenue, Adjusted EBITA (and corresponding margin), order backlog, share of
service assignments, average number of FTE employees and number of branches for each of our business areas
as of and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020.

**Competitive Strengths**

We believe that the following are our key strengths:

**_Top Nordic player focused on regional leadership_**

We are a leading provider of complete installation and service solutions in electrical engineering, heating and
sanitation, ventilation and automation in the Nordic region. We hold a strong position in the growing installation
market in Sweden, Norway and Finland, estimated at approximately SEK 231 billion as of December 31, 2019,
and in 2019, we had the second largest share of Sweden’s installation market by revenue according to
Prognoscentret. In addition, we believe we hold the number one position in the Oslo heating and sanitation
market, and a top 5 position in Finland. Moreover, we expect the acquisition of Fidelix to provide us with a
market-leading position within the building automation market in the Nordics.

We are outperforming the market and gaining market share; specifically, in 2019, we held the second largest
market share (8.4%) of the estimated SEK 98 billion installation market in Sweden, representing a market share
increase of 75 basis points between 2017 and 2019. Our presence in Norway and Finland has also shown strong
growth, with our market share (1.6%) of the estimated SEK 75 billion installation market in Norway increasing
by 44 basis points between 2017 and 2019, and our market share (1%) of the estimated SEK 59 billion
installation market in Finland increasing by 8 basis points over the same period. We have operated through our
constituent subsidiaries in our key markets of Sweden, Norway and Finland for more than half a century and
have a track record of completing contracts on time and in line with customer specifications, which is
underpinned by our commitment to attaining the highest levels of customer satisfaction. We believe that brand

113


-----

awareness and market reputation are key factors for customers deciding upon a particular installation and
services provider and that our established portfolio and track record, therefore, provide us with a significant
competitive advantage.

Importantly, we have developed high network density in our chosen markets, including nation-wide Sweden, the
greater Oslo area (Norway) and in the Helsinki-Turku-Tampere triangle (Finland), with our footprint tailored to
maximize regional leadership in an industry where local scale matters. Our market presence and the scale and
geographic reach of our operations give us a clear advantage over our competitors, which in our fragmented
market comprise mostly small or medium-sized enterprises. This is particularly the case with respect to contracts
for major projects, which typically generate stable revenue streams and cash flows, as we are one of only a small
number of companies in our markets with sufficient resources and expertise to be mandated on, and successfully
execute, such contracts due to the scale, diversity and quality of our installation and service offering.

Our geographic reach has enabled us to attain significant market positions in the regions where we operate,
particularly in Sweden where, in terms of 2017 net revenue, we had nine regions ranked either number one or
number two in electrical engineering, ten in heating and sanitation and six in ventilation. Only one of our
competitors had more regions ranked higher in these categories than Assemblin in Sweden.

Our Group and local scale provide differentiating competitive advantages. At the Group level, we are able to
utilize our procurement expertise to optimize sourcing supplier terms within each business area and leverage on
our digital capabilities. In addition, we leverage certain central functions such as finance, legal, communication
and our central IT platform. At the local level, our geographic network comprises over 166 branches across over
100 locations in the Nordic region, in close proximity to our customers. In certain locations, our business areas
share branch premises allowing for significant cross-selling and cost-reduction opportunities. In addition to being
better positioned to win local tenders, our cross-staffing ability between branches allows us to optimize project
selection. Further, our local scale has allowed us to build a workforce of over 5,800 employees in the Nordic
region with many employees preferring to work for a larger company due to supportive and clear governance,
stability, brand awareness and personal development opportunities.

**_Execution excellence delivered by local branch managers and specialist staff_**

We believe that our decentralized business model contributes to the profitability of our operations. Our current
operating organization is divided into five specific business areas (Assemblin El, Assemblin VS, Assemblin
Ventilation, Assemblin Norway and Assemblin Finland), which in turn consist of regions, divisions and branches
where local decision making and project execution is undertaken. This decentralized and entrepreneurial business
model allows us to swiftly adjust our largely variable cost structure (see “—Resilient and agile business model”)
and promotes entrepreneurial culture and accountability at all levels of our structure with the president of each
business area being responsible, together with their management groups, for the operations and earnings in their
respective business areas.

We believe that one of our key strengths is the division of our business by business area instead of by region. The
focus on business areas allows our managers and their teams to prioritize their technical areas of expertise, it
provides career development opportunities for our talented employees within their respective business lines, as
well as it is also an important advantage in the mergers and acquisition context where the typical target company
has one technical discipline, allowing the target company to join the appropriate part of our business which
focuses on the target’s core strength. For example, we expect the Fidelix Group to be an independent business
area within the Group, and Fidelix’s experienced management team will continue to play a critical role in
Fidelix’s ongoing operations to help ensure continued success.

Through our decentralized business model, our branch managers are incentivized to create value and lead a
specialized and skilled workforce. Specifically, the interplay between specialist staff and strongly incentivized
branch managers has led to improved profitability. Our specialist staff are supported by the Assemblin Academy
and compulsory web courses to enhance their skillsets. In addition, employees are guided by clear development
plans and career ladders, which, in turn, allows us to attract top quality employees. The focus on incentivizing
specialist staff through measures such as the Assemblin Academy as well as our staff incentive plan has
contributed to industry leading employee satisfaction at Assemblin, underpinning our ability to retain specialist
staff. Specifically, in 2019, we achieved an employee net promoter score (“NPS”) of 18, compared to 4 in 2012,
which was substantially higher than the industry average of 9. Furthermore, we have an employer reputation
score of 3.3 in Sweden, which is the highest among our key competitors.

-----

On the branch manager side, branch managers’ decision-making is based on their in-depth local market
knowledge and customer relationships supported by a specialized staff allowing branch managers to reduce costs
and provide a geared installation and service offering to customers. Branch managers are strongly incentivized on
EBITA Margin targets as well as efficient working capital management.

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, enhanced monitoring at the branch level has allowed successful
management of market and operational challenges stemming from COVID-19 restrictions. We have also
experienced successful management of personnel shortfall due to sick leaves during COVID-19 through effective
reallocation between assignments, allowing us to continue relying on our specialist staff.

As a result of our investment in specialist staff and incentivizing our branch managers, the proportion of lossmaking branches has reduced from 38% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 19% for the year ended
December 31, 2019, and these branches contributed only 14% of our net revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2019. The proportion of branches delivering over 7% of EBITA Margin has increased over the
same period from 22% to 40%. The table below outlines the split of branches’ profitability level by EBITA
Margin for the periods indicated, based on management estimates.

Further, our branch managers’ project execution is underpinned by well-established controls which allow us to
execute our decentralized business model. Branch managers are continuously supported and monitored at the
regional, business area and Group level to ensure appropriate risk management and improved profitability. This
support is carried out by, among other things, project selection controls and project execution controls.

In relation to project selection, tenders are approved based on project size, assuming standard contractual terms.
Projects under €1 million can be approved directly by the branch office, with projects between €1 million to
€2 million and €2 million to €5 million required to be approved at the region and business level, respectively.
Projects between €5 million to €10 million must be approved at the Group level and contracts over €10 million
are required to be approved by our Board. With respect to project execution, branches are supported by an
established system of financial, internal and management controls.

**_High revenue visibility from project backlog and recurring services_**

Our ability to sustain profitable operations is underpinned in large part by our strong project backlog and high
incidence of recurring services, which together provide high revenue visibility. This high revenue visibility
allows us to take a more stringent approach in our margin selection criteria. Our order intake volumes grow our
backlog over time. Between September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2020, our order intake increased by 7.1% to
SEK 7,252 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, compared to SEK 6,774 million during the
nine months ended September 30, 2018. Moreover, we experienced our highest annual order intakes to date in
the year ended December 31, 2019, reaching SEK 11,258 million (compared to SEK 9,459 million in 2018),
which was driven in particular by two large orders: the Stockholm Bypass project from the Swedish
Transportation Administration and the new health care building in the Malmö hospital district, which contributed
SEK 520 million and SEK 867 million, respectively, to our order intake during that period. Order backlog as of
September 30, 2020 was SEK 8,245 million, compared to SEK 6,780 million as of September 30, 2018, and the
order intake for 2019 resulted in our reaching our highest annual order intake to date of SEK 8,478 million as of
December 31, 2019. Beginning as early as January 1 of every year, our order backlog provides visibility of more
than 50% of our annual project revenues (excluding service revenues).

We take a consistent approach to order booking and only include signed contracts in our order backlog. Even
when new contracts appear highly likely to be awarded as a result of our Integrated Project Delivery (“IPD”) (see
“Business—Competitive Strengths”) pipeline, we exclude them until they are signed. In addition, the lead time on
our backlog projects has been increasingly extended due to capacity constraints, which now requires customers to
book projects earlier on. We currently hold a strong pipeline of large, more technical and publicly-funded
contracts due to current structural needs for schools, hospitals and transport infrastructures in the Nordic region.

We also benefit from an increasingly high rate of recurring service business and have experienced a meaningful
increase in the conversion rate from project assignments, which primarily consist of new installation or the
redevelopment of, and adaptations to, technical systems in buildings, plants, to service assignments, which
comprise the operation, maintenance, repair, replacement, reconfiguration and monitoring of installations in
buildings, plants and infrastructure. For example, the net revenue of our service business increased from
SEK 2,922 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 to SEK 3,833 million in the year ended December 31,
2019, representing 35.8% and 38.4% of our total net revenue of SEK 8,169 million and SEK 9,978 million
respectively. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, the net revenue of our service business was
SEK 4,007 million, which represented 39.5% of our net revenue of SEK 10,133 million during this period. This
increased service contribution improves our budget accuracy and drives profitable growth, particularly in the
case of recurring services, which pose high barriers to entry for our competitors at the contract renewal stage.

We endeavor to maximize client satisfaction and retention by taking a strategic approach to each customer
relationship. This approach begins by establishing multiple touch points with the customer and developing a deep
understanding of the client’s needs. Next, we offer a state-of-the-art digital platform that allows for continuous
performance monitoring and improvement throughout each assignment. Finally, we provide a comprehensive
breadth of service offerings and aim for performance beyond customer expectations in order to increase the
likelihood of recurring service contracts going forward.

**_Resilient and agile business model_**

Our decentralized and entrepreneurial business model allows us to swiftly adjust our largely variable cost
structure. Installation is the last part of the typical construction project, with multi-technical service providers
having solid predictability of the project pipeline. As a result of our late stage involvement in projects, branch
managers are able to identify early signs in the changes of market dynamics and adjust our variable cost base as
necessary. Our ability to proactively manage or swiftly react to such changes in market dynamics is supported by
our lean and decentralized operational organization of five business areas in three countries, spread across over
166 branches. Approximately 89% of our cost structure during the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 was
variable or semi-variable, which provides us with substantial operational flexibility. Additionally, although to
date the installation market has proved to be relatively resilient to the COVID-19 pandemic and we believe the
underlying drivers for long-term growth remain, we have experienced increased competition due to more
uncertain market conditions. In light of this uncertainty, we believe it is beneficial to be a large, stable player
with an ability to identify and react quickly to market changes, which we believe our leading market position,
strong financial position and decentralized business model allows us to achieve.

Further, branch managers have a diverse end-market exposure with a high share of service assignments and
mainly smaller projects. Based on our end-market analysis conducted for our largest business areas, Electrical
and Heating & Sanitation, in terms of net revenue, between January 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020, a large part

116


-----

of our net revenue originated from cycle-resilient end-markets such as healthcare (10%), education & culture (8%),
infrastructure (2%) and service assignments (42%). Further, we had limited exposure to the Swedish residential
market as approximately 12% of our end-market exposure was attributable to project assignments in the residential
market, with new residential builds representing an estimate of less than 5% of our total project revenue. Other
limited end-market exposures include business (3%), offices (9%), hospitality (2%), warehouses (2%) and industrial
(8%). Our business also has limited dependency on a specific customer or type of contract. According to the
Group’s management estimates, our top ten customers accounted for approximately 30% of our net revenue for the
for the year ended December 31, 2019. Further, based on net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019,
projects (which includes both installation projects as well as certain service projects subject to percentage of
completion accounting) under SEK 50 million, between SEK 50-100 million, over SEK 100 million represented
56%, 5%, 3% of our net revenue, respectively and the remaining 36% being other service assignments.

Following Triton’s acquisition of the Group, we have pursued a strategy of low-risk and accretive bolt-on
acquisitions in order to expand our business. Specifically, with Triton as our owner, we have grown through the
acquisition of 40 additional companies (excluding Fidelix), the largest of which being a carve-out from
construction company Skanska, Skanska Installation, acquired in 2016. The rest of our acquisitions comprised
companies with an average revenue of approximately SEK 48 million and 25 employees. When completing an
acquisition, we anticipate paying a multiple of approximately 4-6 times the target’s EBITA, consistent with the
multiple for our recent historical acquisitions. For more information, see “—History.” We believe that our
established track-record of low-risk bolt-on acquisitions in a consolidating market has allowed us to successfully
realize synergies and integrate the workforce, and we intend to continue to pursue acquisitions in order to
increase our market presence, our service offering and our service capacity.

**_Established track-record of improving margin and Free Cash Flow generation_**
Our profit has increased from SEK 22 million in 2017 to SEK 42 million for the twelve months ended September
30, 2020. Our Adjusted EBITA Margin has increased significantly from 3.1% in 2017 to 5.6% in the twelve
months ended September 30, 2020. Our ability to address market demand and new customer orders as well as our
focus on empowering branch managers and providing fixed services at the Group level have enabled us to
improve profitability. We have also started benefitting from the completion of our accelerated profitability
program, which we completed at the end of 2019 and was targeted to optimize our branch network, reduce
overhead expenditures and improve operational efficiency. Further, we achieved strong Free Cash Flow
generation and Cash Conversion between 2017 and the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, as indicated in
the table below.

Our high cash flow generation has been driven by our capital-lite operations together with efficient working
capital management. Our operations require very limited capital expenditure, which primarily comprises tools,
refurbishment and IT, with our Net Capital Expenditure representing 0.8% of net revenue for the twelve months
ended September 30, 2020. Our service vehicle fleet which is directly linked to the growth of our service
operations is being arranged through flexible financial lease arrangements. We have a high focus on working

capital management across the Group and as a result our Net Working Capital has been negative, being negative
SEK 173 million, or 2.1% as a percentage of net revenue (SEK 8,169 million) for the year ended December 31,
2017, negative SEK 363 million, or 4.1% as a percentage of net revenue (SEK 8,885 million) for the year ended
December 31, 2018, negative SEK 391 million, or 3.9% as a percentage of net revenue (SEK 9,978 million) for
the year ended December 31, 2019 and negative SEK 493 million, or 4.9% as a percentage of net revenue
(SEK 10,133 million) for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020. For the definition of Net Working
Capital, see “Presentation of Financial and Other Data—Non-IFRS Measures.” Our ability to generate Free
Cash Flow has contributed to our growth and has allowed us to undertake our mergers and acquisition strategy
and achieve deleveraging, including since the issuance of the Original Notes as demonstrated by the decrease in
our ratio of total net debt to pro forma Adjusted EBITDA from 4.3x to 3.5x as of September 30, 2020 (without
giving pro forma effect to this Offering). We believe that our successful and proven business model, combined
with our well-established long-term customer relationships, will enable us to continue to achieve profitable
growth and deleverage going forward.

**_An experienced and established management team_**

Our management team consists of experienced professionals with strong backgrounds and operational expertise
in installation and service solutions and a proven track record of acquiring and integrating new businesses. Our
Chief Executive Officer, Mats Johansson, our Chief Financial Officer, Philip Carlson, and our business area chief
executive officers have over 20 years of industry experience, on average. Our management team is supported by
a highly experienced Board, and we also benefit from the extensive market expertise, business relationships and
ongoing strong support of our shareholder, Triton.

**Our Strategy**

We target to be the best installation company in the Nordic region. To achieve our goals, we intend to pursue the
following strategies:

**_Continue to focus on profitable growth by selectively developing our regional leadership and becoming the_**
**_most attractive employer in the industry_**

We are determined to grow our business profitably and sustainably. This means that we will be mindful of
winning market shares and new contracts without compromising on profitability.

We believe that we are well positioned to grow our leading local market positions throughout the Nordic region
and strong local market positions by continuing to provide high-quality services and support to our customers
and employees, and by focusing on our local operations.

We intend to continue to operate a large, decentralized organization, with local branch units operating as
individual profit centers. Maintaining a well-established, local presence throughout the Nordic region also
provides our customers with a large number of local access points. We intend to continue to leverage our strong
customer relationships and local market knowledge to meet our customers’ needs promptly and efficiently, in
order to establish ourselves as the provider of choice in the markets in which we operate.

We will enhance growth by targeting attractive local markets and remaining agile and flexible when it comes to
our footprint so that capital and human resources are always allocated in the most accretive way. We will also
continue to invest in markets where Assemblin is or has the ability to become the largest or second-largest
operator so that we can leverage competitively our scale advantages and Group capabilities while strengthening
our high customer intimacy.

Our employees are key to maintaining and growing our leading-market positions. We intend to utilize our
reputation and intensify our brand awareness to continue to recruit and retain the best talents in the industry and
to position ourselves as the employer of choice. We will also keep track and improve the performance of our
existing managers and technicians by continuing to develop professional and technical training programs and by
assigning our engineers and technicians to a wide range of fields. Strengthening the competence of middle
management is paramount and we are achieving, and will continue to do so, through our Group-wide leadership
model and an improved new structure process for succession planning. We will finally continue to incentivize
our managers and technicians by maintaining a performance-based compensation structure focused on profits and
cash generation rather than volume growth.

118


-----

**_Continue to focus on absolute margin expansion through operational excellence and economies of scale_**

Our profitability has substantially improved since Triton invested in Assemblin. However, we believe that there
is scope to continue to increase our absolute margin level.

While we differentiate our offering by providing consistent, high-quality installation and technical services and
offering a wide range of services to our customers, we are also able to drive cost savings by driving best practices
across our Group.

In 2019, we completed our accelerated profitability improvement program targeted to optimize our branch
network, reduce overhead expenditures and improve operational efficiency. This program provided us with
tangible cost savings in 2019, and we intend to consolidate and build on the improvements achieved so far.

Additionally, to continue to improve our margins and cash flow, we intend to continue focusing on project
selection and execution to allow us to operate more efficiently and profitably in the short-term while reducing
project risk in the long-term. Over time, we are also gaining a better understanding of key success factors and
best practices by analyzing the operational data and profitability metrics on a project by project basis. We
achieve this by measuring branch profitability and by creating a corporate culture where profitability is rewarded
over volume. Execution-wise, we have a clear project governance scheme so that the right resources are allocated
to each project while the adequate communication channels will relay relevant information across the Group.

**_Continue to focus on recurring revenues_**

We believe that the diversity of our customers and our contract portfolio across our operating segments result in
strong, recurring revenues, which help us withstand negative business cycles in any single aspect of our business.
We intend to increase our share of recurring projects with all of our customers by continuing to focus increasing
our maintenance service revenues. We intend to extend this strategy to the companies we acquire, including
Fidelix, whose strong track record of double-digit margins and large and growing installed base further supports
profitability through its aftermarket and cloud businesses.

We also plan to maintain a balance between our installation and services businesses and to continue to capitalize
on our ability to provide add-on maintenance services following the completion of our installation projects as
those tend to be recurring and more predictable by nature.

**_Pursue an accretive bolt-on acquisition growth strategy focused on the right cultural fit with our business_**

The Nordic installation market is highly fragmented and represents a compelling opportunity to grow our
business while generating cost synergies and enhancing price discipline in the market.

We continually evaluate opportunities to acquire and integrate other installation and technical services providers
in the Nordic region in order to strengthen our local competitive position, broaden the range of our offering and
increase our presence in our existing markets. We believe we have significant experience in identifying,
executing and integrating acquisitions while remaining focused on our existing business. We also believe the
acquisition of Fidelix will provide us with a platform for further acquisition-led growth, especially given
Fidelix’s track-record of successful bolt-on acquisitions.

Our focus on technical disciplines allows us to better approach likely targets and provide a compelling view of a
common future. We intend to continue to grow through strategic bolt-on acquisitions but we will prioritize
targets where a good cultural fit with our business which limits integration risk and improves staff retention that
is crucial considering the local, relationship-driven nature of our activity.

**_Accelerate the digitalization of our business in order to find solutions that increase customer benefit and_**
**_internal efficiency, in line with the secular trends we observe in our industry_**

We take an active part in the digital transformation of the building and installation industry. Buildings are
increasingly connected and involve smart, interconnected and automated technical systems. This represents a
substantial growth opportunity for our business that we strive to take advantage of. In particular, the acquisition
of Fidelix brings additional digitalization capabilities across the Group, which we expect to be a driver as we
focus on the next-generation of installation across all of our business areas.

119


-----

Digitalization, however, does not only underpin our long-term growth profile, it is also an opportunity to connect
construction sites to better inform decision-making and foster a closer collaboration across our teams but also
with the various parties which we collaborate with on a construction site.

Each of our business areas has dedicated digitalization managers mapping local initiatives and driving local
digitalization efforts. Our central steering group involves members from all business areas and prioritizes
initiatives according to Assemblin’s digital agenda. Our key successes have historically been on our market
leading expertise in Building Information Modelling (“BIM”) where Assemblin has around 16 years of
experience. This type of modelling is currently used both in large and small projects, improves clarity to all
stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle, and makes it easier to achieve project and business goals. Other
digital tools we have developed includes Assemblin eManageri which is a smart platform helping property
managers and owners to monitor and manage energy efficiency in properties.

**_Continue to leverage “Sustainability” initiatives_**

As energy prices rise and concerns over climate change increase, local, regional and national authorities,
corporates and the public are increasingly demanding socially responsible energy consumption. We believe that
we are well positioned to take advantage of growth in the “green economy.” The energy consumption of a
building is significantly influenced by the design of its electrical, heating and plumbing, and HVAC systems. As
a leading Nordic installer and service provider of those systems, we are able to support customers seeking to
optimize energy utilization in both new and existing buildings. We also offer energy efficiency solutions for
different types of power distribution. We aim at increasing our revenues attributable to the “green economy” by
further developing innovative installation and service offerings in the area of energy efficiency. We also believe
that Fidelix will be accretive to us in this respect given that its technology-driven building automation services
serve to optimize building performance both from a cost and environmental perspective, while providing the
building users with a healthier indoor environment.

**History**

In 2016, following the acquisition by Triton, we changed our name to Assemblin. Imtech Nordic was in turn the
result of acquisitions of a number of leading companies in Nordics with strong reputations in their respective
technical disciplines often spanning decades:

Š Our Electrical business area dates back to 1931, when Närkes Elektriska, NEA was founded in Örebro. NEA
eventually expanded nationwide in Sweden and became a leading actor in electrical installations.

Š Our Heating and Sanitation business area’s and Norway business area’s history stretches back to NVS
originally founded in 1903 which became one of the leading heating and sanitation actors in the Nordic
region, with over 90 offices in Sweden, Norway and Finland.

Š Our Ventilation business area has its roots mainly in Sydtotal, a company founded by industry veterans in
Malmö in 1999 offering ventilation as a total concept.

With Triton as our owner, we have subsequently grown through the acquisition of 38 additional companies
(excluding Fidelix), the largest of which being a carve-out from construction company Skanska, Skanska
Installation, acquired in 2016. In 2020 and the start of 2021, these acquisitions included businesses with
estimated aggregated annual revenues of SEK 696 million, strengthening our footprint across each of our
business areas. In addition, in December 2020 we entered into a sale and purchase agreement to acquire Fidelix, a
technology-driven building automation service company, which is expected to provide us with a market-leading
position within the building automation market in the Nordics. See “Summary—Fidelix—Overview of Fidelix
_Business.”_

Our organic and inorganic growth has made us into a complete installation and service partner, with the strength
of a multidisciplinary group and the personal presence of a local company.

**Group Structure**

We conduct our business through a number of subsidiaries. For more information on our corporate structure, see
“Summary—Corporate Structure and Certain Financing Arrangements.”

**Description of our Operations**

Our operations are decentralized and currently divided into five specific business areas: three in Sweden
(Assemblin El, Assemblin VS and Assemblin Ventilation), one in Norway (Assemblin Norway) and one in
Finland (Assemblin Finland), comprising over 166 branches across over 100 locations in the Nordic region. We
expect the Fidelix Group to be an independent business area within the Group.

The business areas are further divided into a number of regions, divisions and branches, with the local branches
being responsible for earnings, personnel, sales and customer relationships. The local branches are further
supported regionally by the business areas as well as of the Group level, with functions such as finance, legal,
communication and the Group’s IT platform, which has been modernized over the last few years.

We believe that our decentralized business model contributes to the profitability of our operations. This
decentralized and entrepreneurial business model allows us to swiftly adjust to a largely variable cost structure
and promotes enterprise and accountability at all levels of our structure with each of the business areas’ business
presidents being responsible, together with their management groups, for the operations and earnings in their
respective business areas. For more information on the benefits of our decentralized business model, see
“Competitive Strengths—Execution excellence delivered by local branch managers and specialist staff” and

**Our Customer Base and Customer Contracts**

**Our Customer Base**

We have a diversified group of customers who value our high technical competence, ability to conclude projects
according to plan, strong local presence and documented experience with specific building types. Our customers
range from multi-regional companies to small businesses and property owners and comprise a variety of
industries.

Š **_Multi-regional construction companies: The Nordic construction market is dominated by several large,_**
multi-regional companies which tend to have complete responsibility over large project deliveries and use
installers such as Assemblin as subcontractors. We primarily conduct project assignments for these types of
companies. Examples of our customers include PEAB, NCC, Serneke and Skanska.

Š **_Local construction companies: We also work closely with local construction companies in a subcontracting_**
role, primarily focusing our work on project assignments. In the local construction market, strong
relationships are essential to maintaining customers and partnerships.

Š **_Public institutions: Many of our local customers are public institutions, which require strict specifications_**
and a public procurement process. Our work for public institutions includes both project and service
assignments. Examples of our customers include the Stockholm County Council, Akademiska Hus, Region
Östergötland and Skellefteå Kommun.

Š **_Large real-estate developers and property owners: We work with large real-estate developers and property_**
owners who have strong real-estate and construction knowledge. We conduct both project and service
assignments in this market. Examples of our customers include Kungsleden, Ikano, Riksbyggen and
Centrum Fastigheter.

Š **_Industrial and energy companies: Industrial and energy companies are highly knowledgeable about their_**
own products and production processes, but they have less experience in project management. These
companies primarily purchase service assignments, but we complete some project assignments as well.
Examples of our customers include BillerudKorsnäs AB, Sandvik and Skellefteå Kraft.

Š **_Small businesses and property owners: Small businesses and property owners purchase both service and_**
project assignments, but they do so with less frequency than our larger customers. As a result, the decision
process related to our assignments often takes longer.

We have a relative limited exposure to large customers as for year ended December 31, 2019, management
estimates that our ten largest customers together accounted for approximately 30% of our net revenue. Generally,
our project base tends to consist of smaller-scale projects.

**Tender Process and Pricing**

We obtain most projects through competitive bidding. The process for obtaining business differs with respect to
installation projects, on the one hand, and service assignments, on the other hand. The tender process for
installation projects typically involves substantial preparation work, calculations, planning and negotiations with
the potential customer. Depending on the size of the potential project, a tender process can last from a few days
to more than a year.

By contrast, our service projects are typically based on framework agreements or ongoing relationships. Prior
involvement usually offers competitive advantages.

Pricing for installation and service projects takes place primarily at the local branch level, with larger projects
requiring approval from the Group or the Board. Factors that we typically take into account when pricing
installation projects and service assignments may include: (i) the purchase price of materials; (ii) wages and
hourly billing of project managers and employees; (iii) subcontractor costs; (iv) price differentiation for volume,
geography or competence; (v) the fixed price of subscription agreements (in the service sector); and/or
(vi) pricing adjustments relating to the economic cycle and general pricing adjustments.

**Customer Contracts and Framework Agreements**

Our customer contracts in the installation business area consist of construction contracts in which the purchaser is
responsible for the overall project and the design while we are responsible for only the installation, as well as
“turnkey” projects. Where the purchaser remains responsible for design of a project, we act as subcontractor and

127


-----

enter into standard subcontracting arrangements. By contrast, in “turnkey” projects where we act as a main
contractor with principal responsibility for the design and execution of a project, our contracts will contain
general terms that will allocate different responsibilities between us and the customer. Customer agreements
service include individual service agreements for a fixed period, long-term framework agreements (typically
without agreed volumes) and oral agreements (in daily operations).

Additionally, we typically provide to our customers warranty and support service coverage in each of the
countries where we operate. A standard warranty period for customer agreements for installation projects is five
years on materials and workmanship from the date of acceptance and approval by the customer. Where
applicable, the parties may sometimes agree on longer guarantee periods for special equipment. We often
negotiate extension clauses in our supply agreements that provide a warranty period of up to 66 months (in other
terms, five and one-half years) where a purchase is made for an installation project. This ensures adequate
back-to-back coverage during the standard warranty period.

A growing trend is IPD (or Partnering) contract models that have allowed us to be involved at earlier stages in
the project and ensure a more flexible pricing model to allow for changes during the course of the project and a
common interest in sharing risks and opportunities as they arise. These projects are often larger, more long-term
projects and typically, for which we are reimbursed. During this phase we agree the design parameters and
pricing in detail together with the customer before the construction contract is signed. The pricing is typically
flexible against a total target price with lower margins if the price exceeded and higher margins if the price is
held or better.

**Order Intake and Order Backlog**

Order intake represents the value of projects received during any relevant period, plus changes to existing
projects made during that period. We measure our order backlog by business area as of a single date by
calculating the anticipated net revenues from signed and binding contractual commitments existing on that date
less amounts net revenue earned on those commitments up to that date. We have experienced a steady
year-on-year increase in order intake and order backlog in most of our business areas as a result of an increase in
the frequency of higher-profile and more-complex installation projects. Our strong relationships with our
customers have contributed to an order backlog SEK 8,245 million and a LTM order intake of
SEK 9,859 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2020.

The table below sets out the order backlog and order intake for each of our business areas as of and for the twelve
months ended September 30, 2020.

**As of and for the twelve months ended**
**September 30, 2020**

The largest single contract in our order backlog is Bypass Stockholm worth SEK 520 million where we will be
providing the ventilation solutions for a major tunnel project in Stockholm. The production of the project is
planned to 2020-2024. The project is a fixed price project but is subject to indexation and consists mainly of
material and subcontracted work where we have secured back to back agreements to minimize risk to our
calculated margins. In addition, we have four contracts for work on the Malmö Hospital to be produced 2019 to
2024, of which two are conducted through joint-ventures. The current collective value of our joint ventures’
share of these contracts within Electrical, Heating and Sanitation, as well as our contracts within Ventilation, is
SEK 1,099 million.

**Supply and Procurement**

We continuously monitor our supplier base in order to ensure diversification, quality, and risk minimization.
Consistent with our objective of providing our customers with competitive prices, we seek to continuously
decrease our total cost of materials while increasing our competitiveness with new suppliers, new purchasing
channels and new products or solutions. To do so, we engage a two-layered procurement process combining the
central functions of each business area with the individual decision-making of local branches.

128


-----

**Our supplier base**

We have a diversified and high-quality supplier base, which allows us to avoid dependency on any single
supplier. For the year ended December 31, 2019, raw materials and consumables amounted to SEK
3,404 million, or 35% of our total operating expenses of SEK 9,726 million. Our top supplier accounted for only
9% of our purchases from larger suppliers for the year ending December 31, 2019, while our top ten and top
twenty suppliers accounted for 33% and 42%, respectively.

We mitigate the risks associated with the availability of materials and cost inflation by ensuring supplier
diversification and utilizing an inflation pass-through mechanism. With regard to materials, we select multiple
material suppliers to avoid temporary shortages and postponement in our installation work. Additionally, where
we can, we pass through the cost of inflation to our customers. We monitor material prices on a continuous basis,
and changes in prices are passed through to our customers on a short notice via our pricing manuals (for services
and small projects)while our multi-year contracts include index clauses.

Our supplier base includes high-quality original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and wholesalers. The largest
part of our procurement process involves direct material purchases from selected framework agreement suppliers.
Our key manufacturers and distributors are mapped in order to control for benefits and risks; we require all
suppliers to follow our Code of Conduct and subject them to routine evaluations. Examples of our wholesale
suppliers include Ahlsell, Dahl, Rexel and Elektroskandia, and our OEM suppliers include Fagerhult, Schneider
Electric, Lindab and Siemens. Additionally, we make indirect purchases which include vehicles, fuel and work
uniforms.

**Our material procurement process**

We have a centralized procurement process that provides high quality products with low costs and good
availability. From a broad perspective, the top management of the Group sets our Code of Conduct, which guides
all procurement-related activities. At a more functional level, our material procurement comprises two key
players: the central functions within each business area secure favorable terms with suppliers, and then local
branch managers act as the ultimate decision makers. The centralized procurement function in each business area
enables scale benefits and high-quality materials, while branch level procurement through our digital platforms
secures availability and cost efficiency.

Each business area has its own procurement function which governs and supports branch level procurement
while also negotiating framework agreements with suppliers. The procurement function is responsible for
signing, monitoring and reviewing framework agreements. Supplier assessment involves the evaluation of a
range of factors including delivery capacity, warranties, product responsibilities, and prices. The procurement
function within each business area also designates certain supplies as “Assemblin Best Choice” by collaborating
with suppliers and operations to develop and evaluate new materials and products. We aim to offer the highest
quality materials and products at a low cost with good availability to customers. In doing so, we limit our
“Assemblin Best Choice” designation to only those suppliers who comply with relevant laws and requirements,
as well as the requirements set out in our Code of Conduct.

The actual procurement of materials is then done locally by branch or project managers, who are also responsible
for hiring subcontractors for certain tasks, such as insulation work. A high percentage of our procurement is done
via our digital procurement system, which provides an opportunity to select equivalent materials at a lower cost.
We make continuous efforts across the Group to increase the share of digital procurement and to reduce our
number of cash and carry orders.

**Sustainability**

We believe that a responsible long-term sustainable approach is a precondition for stable, profitable growth over
time. This emphasis on sustainability means that we must be prudent with the resources we use in our operations,
and that we must account for the impacts created by our service and installation activities. In doing so, we can
thus generate value for customers, employees and owners, as well as for society as a whole.

Our central sustainability committee reports directly to Group management and is tasked with monitoring
legislation, following up on shared sustainability initiatives, channeling and disseminating good ideas and
preparing documentation for decisions by our management. Additionally, the committee analyses semi-annual
reporting data from each business area in order to address key sustainability figures and develop proposals that
are prioritized by our management.

129


-----

Based on our operations, we have identified a number of key sustainability topics, which are categorized from a
stakeholder perspective.

**Sustainability as an employer**

We believe that committed, satisfied employees produce better results. Therefore, we have identified three
sustainability initiatives designed to further our role as a responsible employer that offers stimulating
assignments in a positive, safe and non-discriminating work environment: (i) Development and training;
(ii) Health and safety; and (iii) Human rights, diversity and equality.

**Sustainability as a supplier**

We seek to create value for our customers by providing innovative, sustainable installations that improve
building functionality and make people feel comfortable. In our role as a supplier, we have developed three
sustainability initiatives intended to strengthen our relationship with customers: (i) Safe, efficient methods;
(ii) Innovative, customized and energy-efficient solutions; and (iii) Sourcing and supplier management.

**Sustainability as investment**

We intend to be an attractive investment object that delivers stable and profitable growth with controlled risk.
Our goal is to produce a strong yield through stable financial development, with measured risks and a sound
approach grounded in business ethics. This requires the use of sound accounting policies and external auditors, as
well as routine reporting of business and sustainability issues to our owners. Finally, we emphasize the values in
our Code of Conduct to all employees, and we hold our suppliers to similarly high standards of conduct.

**Sustainability initiatives in the Community**

We intend to be a positive member of the community that conducts sustainable long-term operations with
minimal negative impact on the environment and society. In this capacity, we seek to promote healthy citizens,
create job opportunities and tax revenue and inspire local community involvement, while minimizing the
environmental impact of our operations.

**Sustainability as a Corporate Citizen**

We intend to be a positive member of the community that conducts sustainable long-term operations with
minimal negative impact on the environment and society. In this capacity, we seek to promote healthy citizens,
create job opportunities and tax revenue and inspire local community involvement, while minimizing the
environmental impact of our operations.

**Human Resources and Personnel**

**Employees**

As of September 30, 2020, we had approximately 5,800 employees located throughout Sweden, Norway and
Finland. The average number of FTE employees for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 and the years
ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was 5,860, 5,901, 5,630 and 5,639, respectively. Our employees are
divided between group, business area, regional and branch level, with the vast majority being employed at branch
level. When a particular project requires skills outside our technical fields, we employ subcontractors.

Our employees are supported through measures such as the Assemblin Academy as well as our staff incentive
plan, which have contributed to industry leading employee satisfaction at Assemblin, underpinning our ability to
retain specialist staff. Specifically, in 2019, we achieved an employee net promoter score of 18, which was
substantially higher than the industry average of 9. Our employer reputation in Sweden is also higher than our
competitors.

The following table sets out our NPS score for the periods indicated, along with the industry average score:

**Labor Relations and Pension Issues**

Our employees are covered by either a defined contribution pension plan or a benefit pension plan. For more
information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We may be required to make
_further contributions to our pension schemes if the value of pension fund assets is not sufficient to cover potential_
_obligations and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”_

We are bound by various collective bargaining agreements in each of the countries in which we operate. We
consider our relationship with our employees to be good.

**Information Technology**

Over the last few years, we have modernized our IT environment to support its decentralized organization. At the
Group level, there is a central IT function that, in close collaboration with the business area IT functions, is
responsible for the necessary coordination as well as developing and administering the shared systems. The
development projects completed in 2018 included implementation of a new data warehouse and BI system,
development of a new contract database and roll-out of Office 365. In addition, we communicate with our
employees through an intranet system that is supported by a mobile application.

**Insurance**

Our Group-wide insurance coverage includes policies for risks associated with our business, including general
liability, contract and property, directors’ and officers’ liability, as well as automobile, buildings and contents
and workers’ compensation policies. We believe that our insurance coverage is consistent with or above industry
standards.

**Litigation**

We provide a complex range of services to a large number of customers. As such, in the ordinary course of
business, we are subject to various administrative, legal and/or regulatory proceedings. On the basis of current
information, we do not expect that the actual claims, lawsuits and other proceedings to which we are subject, or
potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings relating to matters of which we are aware, will ultimately have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. We note, however, that the
outcome of legal proceedings is extremely difficult to predict with certainty, and we offer no assurance in this
regard.

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS**

_The following summary of certain provisions of the documents listed below governing certain of our indebtedness_
_does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the underlying_
_documents. Unless otherwise defined in this offering memorandum or unless the context otherwise requires,_
_terms defined in the Facilities Agreements and the Intercreditor Agreement shall have the same meanings when_
_used in this section._

**The Super Senior Facilities**

**_Overview and structure_**

On December 2, 2019, the Issuer entered into a SEK 650 million “super senior” revolving credit and guarantee
facilities agreement (the “Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities Agreement,” and the revolving credit facility
thereunder shall be referred to as the “Revolving Credit Facility” and the guarantee facility thereunder shall be
referred to as the “Guarantee Facility,” and the Revolving Credit Facility and the Guarantee Facility shall jointly
be referred to as the “Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities”) with, among others, Deutsche Bank AG,
London Branch and Nordea Bank Abp, filial i Sverige, as mandated lead arrangers (together the “RCF Mandated
Lead Arrangers”) and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch and Nordea Bank Abp, filial i Sverige as original
lenders (together the “RCF Original Lenders”), and Nordea Bank Abp, filial i Sverige as agent (the “RCF
Agent”) and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch as security agent (the “Security Agent”); and

On December 2, 2019, the Issuer entered into a SEK 240 million “super super senior” pension guarantee facility
agreement (“Pension Guarantee Facility Agreement” and together with the Revolving Credit and Guarantee
Facilities Agreement, the “Facilities Agreements,” and the facility under the Pension Guarantee Facility
Agreement shall be referred to as the “Pension Guarantee Facility,” and together with the Revolving Credit and
Guarantee Facilities, the “Super Senior Facilities”) with, among others, Nordea Bank Abp, filial i Sverige as
mandated lead arranger (together with the RCF Mandated Lead Arrangers, the “Mandated Lead Arrangers”) and
Nordea Bank Abp, filial i Sverige as original lender (together the “Guarantee Original Lenders” and together
with the RCF Original Lenders, the “Original Lenders”), and Nordea Bank Abp, filial i Sverige as agent (the
“Pension Guarantee Facility Agent” and together with the RCF Agent, the “Agents”) and the Security Agent as
security agent.

The Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities Agreement, subject to the possibility to incur “additional
revolving facilities” and “additional guarantee facilities” (see “—Additional Facilities”), provides for borrowings
up to an aggregate initial principal amount of SEK 450 million and guarantees up to an aggregate principal
amount of SEK 200 million on a committed basis.

The Issuer intends to increase the size of the Revolving Credit Facility commitments by SEK 190 million on the
Completion Date through the provision of an additional revolving facility and additional facility commitments
thereunder (see “—Additional Facilities”). The existing guarantees and security granted under the Revolving
Credit and Guarantee Facilities Agreement would extend to cover such increase, subject to the guarantee
limitations set forth therein. The effectiveness of a portion of the increase in the size of the Revolving Credit
Facility (SEK 73 million) is subject to the completion of the Fidelix Acquisition.

The Pension Guarantee Facility Agreement provides for guarantees up to an aggregate initial principal amount of
SEK 240 million on a committed basis, subject to incurrence of “additional pension guarantee facilities” under
the Pension Guarantee Facility Agreement (see “—Additional Facilities”).

The:

(a) Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized by any current or future borrower (subject to certain exceptions)
under the Revolving Credit Facility in Swedish krona or certain other currencies by the drawing of cash
advances or, subject to the appointment of an issuing bank, the issue of bank guarantees and documentary
credits (including letters of credit and performance bonds) and by way of ancillary facilities;

(b) Guarantee Facility may be utilized by any current or future borrower (subject to certain exceptions) under
the Guarantee Facility in Swedish krona or certain other currencies by the issue of, subject to the
appointment of an issuing bank, letters of credits, bank guarantees and by way of ancillary facilities by way
of guarantee facilities; and

(c) Pension Guarantee Facility may be utilized by any current or future borrower (subject to certain exceptions)
under the Pension Guarantee Facility in Swedish krona by the issue of, subject to the appointment of an

137


-----

issuing bank, bank guarantees and by way of ancillary facilities by way of pension guarantee facilities. The
Pension Guarantee Facility is intended to provide a guarantee required by the Swedish pensions regulatory
authorities in respect of a portion of the Group’s defined-benefit pensions obligations.

Subject to certain exceptions, loans and guarantees may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed at any time.

Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are available to finance or refinance the general corporate
purposes and/or working capital requirements of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries (the “Restricted Group”)
including, without limitation, to refinance and/or repay existing revolving credit and receivables financing
arrangements of the Group (including factoring, securitization and other receivables financings) and/or the
financing and/or refinancing of (i) capital expenditure and related costs and expenses, (ii) acquisitions,
investments, joint ventures and related costs and expenses, (iii) operational restructurings and reorganizations of
the Restricted Group and related costs and expenses (iv) payments (including to be made to the vendors) in
respect of working capital related adjustments relating to or in connection with any acquisition (including
acquisitions), (v) payments of refundable VAT on any fees, costs or expenses related to or incurred in connection
with the finance documents for the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility or any acquisition (including the
Corporate Reorganization) and any original issue discount, fees, flex and/or other related financing costs and/or
(vi) interest payments due in respect of the Notes.

Amount utilized under the Guarantee Facility were initially required to be applied by the Issuer and its Restricted
Group towards the issuance of bank guarantees guaranteeing operational liabilities only, and not to any financial
liabilities. Further to a consent and amendment request granted by the RCF Agent (on behalf of the majority
lenders) on December 21, 2020, the bank guarantees under the Guarantee Facility may now also extend to
guarantee pension liabilities of the Group, but not any other financial liabilities and only to the extent
Försäkringsbolaget PRI Pensionsgaranti, ömsesidigt is the beneficiary of such guarantee.

Amount utilized under the Pension Guarantee Facility shall be applied to provide a guarantee required by the
pension administrator in respect of a portion of the Group’s defined-benefit pensions obligations.

In accordance with the requirements of the pension administrator, we have been required to increase the amount
of our current SEK 240 million bank guarantee (incurred under the Pension Guarantee Facility) by SEK 45
million. Further to the grant of the consent and amendment request, we have initially incurred this additional
amount of SEK 45 million under the Guarantee Facility. We expect to ultimately incur the full SEK 285 million
under the Pension Guarantee Facility once we have increased the SEK 240 million of aggregate commitments
thereunder by SEK 45 million, as permitted under the terms of the Pension Guarantee Facility Agreement (and to
cancel the amount initially incurred under the Guarantee Facility) (see “—Additional Facilities”).

**_Interest Rate and Fees_**

**_Prepayment_**

The Facilities Agreements allow for voluntary prepayments (subject to a minimum amount and notice
requirements).

The Facilities Agreements also permit each lender to require the mandatory prepayment of all amounts due to
that lender upon:

(a) a “change of control” (which comprises, generally, (i) Holdco ceasing to directly own legally and
beneficially 100% of the issued share capital of the Issuer and (ii) the scenarios set out under the definition
of “Change of Control” under the caption “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions”;

**_Additional Facilities_**

The Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities Agreement contemplates the incurrence of uncommitted

aggregate sum of:

(a) in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility (i) the greater of (x) SEK 550 million and (y) an amount equal to
80% of consolidated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization plus certain adjustments,
similar to those in Consolidated EBITDA as set out in “Description of the Notes,” of the Restricted Group
for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters prior to such incurrence and (ii) less the total Revolving

guarantee facilities described herein). Such additional revolving facilities and guarantee facilities may be
incurred under the Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities Agreement either as a new revolving facility, a
new guarantee facility and/or as an additional tranche of any existing revolving facility and/or guarantee
facility and/or by increasing the commitments under an existing revolving facility or an existing guarantee
facility. Such additional revolving facilities and/or guarantee facilities may be secured or unsecured and
may rank either (i) pari passu with the Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities and be prepaid on a pro
rata basis (including with respect to mandatory prepayments) or (ii) subordinated to the Revolving Credit
and Guarantee Facilities. The lenders of any such additional revolving facilities and/or guarantee facilities
may not have the benefit of guarantees from any member of the Restricted Group which is not a borrower or
guarantor of the Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities or security over assets other than the then
existing transaction security for the Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities (except where the same
security (to the extent permitted by law) is granted in respect of the other facilities under the Revolving
Credit and Guarantee Facilities).

In addition, the Pension Guarantee Facility Agreement allows for the incurrence of “additional pension guarantee
facilities” to the extent required by the pension administrator.

The availability, maturity, pricing and other terms of any additional revolving facility, guarantee facility and/or
pension guarantee facilities is those agreed between the Issuer and the relevant lenders of that additional facility,
_provided that (i) no additional facility may have a maturity date that is earlier than the maturity date of (as_
applicable) the Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities or the Pension Guarantee Facility (or, as applicable in
each case, if at such time the Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities or the Pension Guarantee Facility have
been cancelled in full or would be repaid and cancelled in full after giving effect to the application of proceeds of
the relevant additional revolving facility, guarantee facility and/or pension guarantee facility, any final maturity
date), (ii) no “event of default” has occurred and is continuing at the time the relevant additional revolving

140


-----

facility, guarantee facility and/or pension guarantee facility is committed (unless the proceeds of the relevant
additional revolving facility, guarantee facility and/or pension guarantee facility are used to refinance existing
additional revolving facilities, guarantee facilities or pension guarantee facilities), (iii) no additional pension
guarantee facility may be established unless Försäkringsbolaget PRI Pensionsgaranti, ömsesidigt (PRI Pension
Guarantee, Mutual Insurance Company) has requested additional credit support from the Group and (iv) no
member of the Group may provide an additional revolving facility, guarantee facility and/or pension guarantee
facility and no Sponsor or member of the Group may provide an additional pension guarantee facility.

**_Guarantees_**

The Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities are guaranteed by the Issuer and the Initial Guarantors
(comprising Assemblin Holding AB, Assemblin AB, Assemblin Sweden AB, Assemblin Holding AS, Assemblin
El AB, Assemblin VS AB, Assemblin Ventilation AB, Assemblin AS and Assemblin Installation AB).

The Pension Guarantee Facility is guaranteed by the Issuer and the Initial Guarantors.

Each Facilities Agreement requires that, subject to certain “agreed security principles” set out in the Facilities
Agreements, each member of the Restricted Group that is, or becomes, a “material company” (which is generally
defined under the Facilities Agreements to include, among other things, any member of the Restricted Group that
has earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization representing 5% or more of the consolidated
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of the Group, and any member of the Restricted
Group that is the direct holding company of a borrower or guarantor of the Revolving Credit and Guarantee
Facilities that is a “material company”) after November 29, 2019 (in each case, non wholly-owned member of the
Group only to the extent there are no applicable restrictions) (by reference to the most recent annual consolidated
financial statements of the Issuer (commencing with the first complete fiscal year ending after the November 29,
2019) is required to become a guarantor under the Facilities Agreements within 90 days of the date of delivery of
the relevant annual consolidated or combined, as applicable, financial statements of the Issuer for the relevant
fiscal year.

Furthermore, if on the last day of each financial year of the Issuer (commencing with the first complete financial
year after November 29, 2019), the guarantors represent less than 80% of the consolidated earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of the members of the Group (subject to certain exceptions) (the
“Guarantor Coverage Test”), within 90 days of delivery of the annual financial statements for the relevant
financial year (commencing with the first complete financial year after November 29, 2019), such other members
of the Restricted Group (subject to the agreed security principles and certain other exceptions) are required to
become guarantors until the Guarantor Coverage Test is satisfied (to be calculated as if such additional
guarantors had been guarantors on the last day of the relevant financial year). Non wholly-owned members of the
Group may be excluded from such calculation if there is a restriction applicable to it in relation to becoming a
guarantor.

**_Security_**

The Super Senior Facilities are secured by security interests granted over the same property and assets which
secure the Notes, and are expected to be secured by the Post-Closing Collateral within 60 business days of the
Issue Date (subject to the agreed security principles set out in the Facilities Agreements), as further described
under “Description of the Notes—Security.”

Each holding company of any “material company” (provided that such holding company is a member of the
Restricted Group (in each case, non wholly-owned member of the Group only to the extent there are no
applicable restrictions)) which becomes a guarantor under any Super Senior Facility is required (subject to the
agreed security principles set out in the Facilities Agreements) to grant security over the shares it holds in such
material company in favor of the Security Agent.

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, proceeds from the enforcement of the transaction security for the
Super Senior Facilities (whether or not shared with the holders of the Notes or the Guarantee Original Lenders) is
required to be applied to repay indebtedness outstanding under:

(a) the Pension Guarantee Facility in priority to the Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities, hedging
obligations and the Notes; and

(b) the Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities, as well as certain hedging obligations, in priority to the
Notes.

an “initial public offering” (that does not result in a “change of control”) and the achievement of a “consolidated
net leverage ratio” of the Restricted Group is equal to or less than 3.00:1.00 (generally, pro forma for any
prepayment of the Revolving Credit Facility from the proceeds of such initial public offering) or (ii) a member of
the Restricted Group or a holding company of the Issuer having achieved an investment grade status (Baa3/BBBor better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group).

The Facilities Agreements also contain a “notes purchase condition” covenant, which provides, subject to certain
exceptions set out in the Facilities Agreements, that the Issuer may not, and shall procure that no other member
of the Restricted Group will, prepay, purchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire for value any of the principal
amount of the Notes prior to the scheduled repayment date. The exceptions to such covenant include, inter alia:
(i) notes purchases funded with certain permitted indebtedness under the Facilities Agreement; (ii) (provided no
“event of default” under any Super Senior Facility is continuing or would result from such note purchase) where
the “consolidated net leverage ratio” for the Restricted Group would be equal to or less than 3.50:1.00 at the time
such note purchase is contractually committed (pro forma to take account of the relevant notes purchase);
(iii) (provided no event of default under any Super Senior Facility is continuing or would result from such note
purchase) note purchases that do not exceed 50% of the aggregate face value of the Notes in existence at
November 29, 2019 or incurred afterwards (and any permitted refinancing thereof); or (iv) (provided no event of
default under any Super Senior Facility is continuing or would result from such note purchase) the Revolving
Credit Facility is cancelled (and if applicable prepaid) in the same or greater proportion as the proportion of the
note purchase to the aggregate face value of the Notes then outstanding.

142

“senior secured net leverage” financial covenant.” The financial covenant is tested quarterly on a rolling basis,
generally, subject to (i) the first test date falling on the date that is the end of the second fiscal quarter date after
December 6, 2019 and (ii) the Revolving Credit Facility being at least 40% cash drawn on the relevant test date.
The finance parties under the Pension Guarantee Facility Agreement will not benefit from the financial covenant.

The Issuer is permitted to prevent or cure breaches of the financial covenant by applying a “cure” amount
(generally, amounts received by the Issuer in cash pursuant to any new equity or permitted shareholder
subordinated debt), including as if “consolidated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization” had
been reduced by such amount. There is no requirement to apply any such cure amount in prepayment of the
Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities. No more than four different cure amounts may be taken into account
prior to the original termination date of the Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities Agreement and cure
amounts in consecutive financial quarters are not permitted.

The Facilities Agreements provide for some of the same events of default, with certain adjustments, as those
applicable for the Notes as set forth in the section entitled “Description of the Notes—Events of Default.” In
addition, the Super Senior Facilities provides for certain customary events of default, all of which are subject to
customary materiality and other qualifications, exceptions, baskets and/or grace periods, as appropriate,
comprising without limitation: (i) breach of the financial covenant subject to possibilities to cure the financial
covenant breach; (ii) breach of other obligations in material respects subject to a 20 business day grace period;
(iii) representations or warranties found to be untrue or misleading when made or deemed repeated subject to a
20 business day grace period; (iv) material litigation, arbitration or administrative, governmental, regulator or
other proceedings against any member of the Group or the Parent; (v) change of ownership of borrowers or
ancillary borrowers (in each case other than the Issuer) under any of the Facilities Agreements; (vi) cross default
subject to thresholds; (vii); cessation of business; (viii) unlawfulness and invalidity subject to a 20 business day
grace period; (ix) failure to comply with a material term of the Intercreditor Agreement subject to a 20 business
day grace period; and (x) repudiation and rescission of the finance documents subject to a 20 business day grace
period.

No default or event of default (other than a non-payment default under the Pension Guarantee Facility
Agreement) shall be deemed to have occurred or be continuing under the Pension Guarantee Facility Agreement
unless a corresponding default or event of default has occurred and is continuing under the Revolving Credit and
Guarantee Facilities Agreement (or any replacement facility) for as long any such agreement remains in force
and (ii) any such default or event of default (other than in relation to non-payment default or event of default
under the Pension Guarantee Facility Agreement) of the Pension Guarantee Agreement shall be continuing for as
long as the corresponding default or event of default is continuing under the Revolving Credit and Guarantee
Facilities Agreement (or any replacement facility) for as long as any such agreement remain in force.

**_Governing Law_**

The Facilities Agreements is governed by English law, provided that the events of default, incurrence covenants
and related definitions for the Notes included (with certain adjustments) in the Facilities Agreements are
interpreted in accordance with the law of the State of New York.

**_Intercreditor Agreement_**

To establish the relative rights of certain of our creditors under certain of our financing arrangements, the Issuer
and HoldCo entered into an intercreditor agreement (the “Intercreditor Agreement”) on December 3, 2019,
together with the RCF Agent, the Pension Guarantee Facility Agent, the Original Lenders and the Mandated
Lead Arrangers, as well as the Trustee for the holders of the Notes (the “Senior Secured Notes Trustee”) and the
Security Agent.

By accepting an Additional Note, the relevant holder thereof shall be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the
terms and conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement and shall be deemed to have authorized the Trustee to enter
into the Intercreditor Agreement on its behalf as Senior Secured Notes Trustee.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions, among others, that are contained in the
Intercreditor Agreement and which relate to the rights and obligations of the holders of the Notes. It does not

143


-----

restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety. As such, you are urged to read the Intercreditor Agreement
because it, and not the description that follows, defines certain rights of the holders of the Additional Notes.

Unless expressly stated otherwise in the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of a conflict between the terms of
the Facilities Agreements, the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, the provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement will prevail.

The Temporary Notes will not be subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Temporary Trustee shall not be
a party to the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Overview_**

The Intercreditor Agreement sets out, among other things:

Š the relative ranking of certain debt of the Issuer and its “restricted subsidiaries” (together, the “Group”) in
respect of “Pension Guarantee Facility Liabilities,” “RCF and Guarantee Facilities Liabilities,” “Credit
Facility Liabilities,” “Senior Secured Notes Liabilities,” “Future Pari Passu Debt Liabilities,” “Super Senior
Hedging Liabilities,” “Pari Passu Hedging Liabilities” and “Future Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities”
(each as defined below);

Š the relative ranking of certain security granted by certain members of the Group for the benefit of certain
creditors under certain of our financing arrangements;

Š when payments can be made in respect of certain indebtedness of the Group;

Š when enforcement action (including acceleration and/or demand for payment and certain similar actions)
(“Enforcement Action”) can be taken in respect of the “Transaction Security” (as defined below);

Š the requirement to turnover amounts received from enforcement of the Transaction Security and certain
guarantees provided by certain members of the Group;

Š when the Transaction Security and guarantee(s) issued by certain members of the Group are released to
permit an enforcement sale;

Š the circumstances under which creditors’ claims (including the claims of holders of the Notes against the
Issuer) might be required to be transferred to third parties or released to assist in enforcement; and

Š the order for applying proceeds from the enforcement of the Transaction Security, certain guarantees and
other amounts received by the Security Agent.

_Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness_

The Intercreditor Agreement contains customary provisions regulating certain additional indebtedness permitted
to be incurred by members of the Group and which is contemplated to be secured by the documents creating
security (including the Collateral) (the “Transaction Security”) granted by certain members of the Group
(together, the “Transaction Security Documents”).

Such additional indebtedness may either, with respect to the Transaction Security (and the proceeds thereof):
(i) be in the form of loans, credit or debt facilities or notes (among other things) and have equivalent rights to the
rights of the holders of the Notes under the Intercreditor Agreement, in which case it will vote in, and share in the
proceeds of, enforcement of the Transaction Security with the same class of creditors as the holders of Notes
(such indebtedness, “Future Pari Passu Debt” and, the holders of such indebtedness, “Future Pari Passu Debt
Creditors”); (ii) be in the form of a “credit facility” ranking senior to the liabilities in respect of the Notes with
respect to the proceeds of enforcement of the Transaction Security, in which case it will vote in, and share in the
proceeds of, enforcement of Transaction Security with the lenders under the Revolving Credit and Guarantee
Facilities and any “Super Senior Hedging Agreements” (as defined below) (such additional credit facilities,
solely for the purposes of this description of the Intercreditor Agreement, the “Credit Facilities” and, the lenders
of such indebtedness, the “Additional Credit Facility Lenders”); (iii) be in the form of a “pension guarantee
facility” ranking senior to the liabilities in respect of the Super Senior Lenders with respect to the proceeds of
enforcement of the Transaction Security, in which case it will vote in, and share in the proceeds of, enforcement
of Transaction Security with the lenders under the Pension Facilities (such additional pension guarantee facilities,
solely for the purposes of this description of the Intercreditor Agreement, the “Additional Pension Facilities” and,
the lenders of such indebtedness, the “Additional Pension Guarantee Facility Lenders”); or (iv) to the extent that
it benefits from Transaction Security, be in the form of loans, credit or debt facilities or notes (among other
things) and rank junior to the liabilities in respect of the Notes, in which case it will share in the proceeds of
enforcement of the Transaction Security expressed to secure it on a junior basis to the holders of the Notes (such
indebtedness, “Future Senior Subordinated Debt,” and the lenders or holders of such indebtedness, the “Future
Senior Subordinated Creditors”).

-----

_Hedging Transactions_

The Intercreditor Agreement contains provisions that permit certain members of the Group to enter into hedging
agreements with certain hedge counterparties, which may also be secured by the Transaction Security.

The hedging agreements may either, with respect to the Transaction Security (and the proceeds thereof): (i) be
secured on a senior basis to the liabilities in respect of the Notes with respect to the proceeds of enforcement of
the Transaction Security, in which case it will vote in, and share in the proceeds of, enforcement of the
Transaction Security with the lenders and creditors under the Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities (such
hedging agreements, the “Super Senior Hedging Agreements,” and, the hedge counterparties in respect thereof,
the “Super Senior Hedging Banks”); or (ii) have equivalent rights to the rights of the holders of the Notes under
the Intercreditor Agreement, in which case it will vote in, and share in the proceeds of, enforcement of the
Transaction Security with the same class of creditors as the holders of Notes and the holders of any Future Pari
Passu Debt (such hedging agreements, the “Pari Passu Hedging Agreements,” and, the hedge counterparties in
respect thereof, the “Pari Passu Hedging Banks” and, together with the Super Senior Hedging Banks, the
“Hedging Banks”).

_Intra-Group Debt and Shareholder Debt_

None of the Issuer, any of its restricted subsidiaries or any shareholder of a member of the Group which is not
otherwise party to (1) a document creating security in favor of any of the “Super Super Senior Creditors” (as
defined below), “Super Senior Creditors” (as defined below), “Senior Secured Creditors” (as defined below) or
the Future Senior Subordinated Creditors or (2) the debt documents thereby secured, is party to the Intercreditor
Agreement save for: (i) any shareholder of the Issuer (or affiliate of the Issuer which is not a member of the
Group) in respect of any existing or future loan made to the Issuer or any of its restricted subsidiaries (each a
“Shareholder Creditor,” and each such loan, the “Shareholder Debt Liabilities”); and (ii) certain members of the
Group that lend (each an “Intragroup Lender”) to other members of the Group and each debtor under such loan or
any other entity which accedes or otherwise becomes a party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a debtor and/or
creditor, that will accede to the Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the loans or indebtedness owing from
such member of the Group to such other member of the Group in respect of intra-group loans which are in an
aggregate amount of €10 million or more and which are or is outstanding for more than twelve months (the
“Intra-Group Liabilities”) (each an “Obligor” and, together, the “Obligors”).

The Intercreditor Agreement contains subordination provisions relating to any Intra-Group Liabilities as well as
the Shareholder Debt Liabilities. However, Obligors will not be prohibited from making payments in respect of
any Intra-Group Liabilities until an “acceleration event” has occurred and is continuing under any of the
Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities Agreement, the Indenture, any Credit Facility, any Future Pari Passu
Debt or any Future Senior Subordinated Debt.

_Security Agent_

There is a single security agent appointed to act at all times on behalf of (i) the lenders under the Pension
Guarantee Facility Agreement (together, the “Pension Guarantee Lenders”) and any Additional Pension
Guarantee Facility Lenders (together, the “Super Super Senior Creditors”), (ii) the lenders under the Revolving
Credit and Guarantee Facilities and any Additional Credit Facility Lender (together, the “RCF and Guarantee
Lenders”), any Super Senior Hedging Banks and any Additional Credit Facility Lenders (together, the “Super
Senior Creditors”), (ii) the holders of the Notes, any Pari Passu Hedging Banks and any Future Pari Passu Debt
Creditors (collectively, the “Senior Secured Creditors” and, together with the Super Senior Creditors and the
Super Super Senior Creditors, the “Senior Creditors,” and the debt owing to the Senior Creditors, the “Senior
Debt”) and (iii) any Future Senior Subordinated Creditors.

**_Ranking and Priority_**

_Priority of Indebtedness_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the liabilities of the Obligors, as the case may be, in respect of the
Pension Facilities (the “Pension Guarantee Facility Liabilities”) and any Additional Pension Facilities (together
with the Pension Guarantee Facility Liabilities, the “Super Super Senior Liabilities”), the Revolving Credit and
Guarantee Facilities (the “RCF and Guarantee Facilities Liabilities”), any Credit Facilities (the “Credit Facility
Liabilities”), the Notes and any additional notes issued from time to time under the Indenture (together, the
“Senior Secured Notes,” and the liabilities in respect thereof, the “Senior Secured Notes Liabilities”), the Future

Pari Passu Debt (the “Future Pari Passu Debt Liabilities”), the amounts owing to the Super Senior Hedging
Banks under the Super Senior Hedging Agreements (the “Super Senior Hedging Liabilities” and, together with
the RCF and Guarantee Facilities Liabilities and the Credit Facility Liabilities, the “Super Senior Liabilities”)
and the amounts owing to the Pari Passu Hedging Banks under the Pari Passu Hedging Agreements (the “Pari
Passu Hedging Liabilities” and, together with the Super Senior Hedging Liabilities, the “Hedging Liabilities”),
certain customary costs and expenses of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee (the “Senior Secured Trustee
Liabilities”), amounts owing to the Security Agent, and amounts owing to the representatives for the creditors
under the Super Super Senior Liabilities, the RCF and Guarantee Facilities Liabilities, the Credit Facility
Liabilities, the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities and the Pari Passu Hedging Liabilities, respectively, ranks
equally (without preference among them) in right and priority of payment and in priority to the liabilities of the
Obligors, as the case may be, in respect of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt (the “Future Senior Subordinated
Debt Liabilities”), the Intra-Group Liabilities and the Shareholder Debt Liabilities.

The Future Senior Subordinated Debt ranks in priority to the Intra-Group Liabilities and the Shareholder Debt
Liabilities.

The Intercreditor Agreement does not rank any of liabilities and/or obligations owed any person who is not the
Issuer or a restricted subsidiary of the Issuer.

_Priority of Transaction Security_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Transaction Security created pursuant to the Transaction Security
Documents shall rank and secure the following liabilities in the following order (but only, in each case, to the
extent that such Transaction Security is expressed to secure those liabilities):

Š **first, pari passu between themselves and without any preference between them, the Super Super Senior**
Liabilities, the RCF and Guarantee Facilities Liabilities, the Credit Facility Liabilities, the Super Senior
Hedging Liabilities, the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the Future Pari Passu Debt Liabilities, certain
customary costs and expenses of the Senior Secured Trustee and the Pari Passu Hedging Liabilities; and

Š **second, pari passu between themselves and without any preference between them, the Future Senior**
Subordinated Debt Liabilities.

The proceeds from the enforcement of the Transaction Security are to be applied as described below under the
caption “—Application of Proceeds/Waterfall.”

_Intra-Group Liabilities and Shareholder Debt Liabilities_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Intra-Group Liabilities and the Shareholder Debt Liabilities are
postponed and subordinated to the liabilities owed by the Obligors to the Super Super Senior Creditors, the Super
Senior Creditors, the Senior Secured Creditors and the Future Senior Subordinated Creditors (collectively, the
“Primary Creditors”).

**_Restrictions on Payments_**

_Super Super Senior Creditors, Super Senior Creditors and Senior Secured Creditors_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Obligors may make payments in respect of the Super Super Senior
Liabilities, RCF and Guarantee Facilities Liabilities, the Credit Facility Liabilities, the Senior Secured Notes
Liabilities and the Future Pari Passu Debt Liabilities, respectively, at any time in accordance with their respective
terms.

_Future Senior Subordinated Creditors_

Prior to the date of discharge of all Senior Debt (the “Senior Debt Discharge Date”), except with the prior
consent of an “Instructing Group” (as defined below), neither the Issuer nor any member of the Group may make
payments in respect of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities without the consent of the “Relevant
Representative” (as defined below) except for the following:

(1) if:

incurrence of such Future Senior Subordinated Debt, no earlier than the date falling six months
after the original scheduled maturity date of the Notes issued on or about the date of the
Intercreditor Agreement (it being acknowledged that such Future Senior Subordinated Debt may
have customary optional redemption, change of control, asset sale and/or other customary
mandatory redemption provisions) and (y) such maturity date is no earlier than that contained in
the relevant Future Senior Subordinated Debt documents as of the first date of incurrence of any
Future Senior Subordinated Debt); or

(ii) any other amount in respect of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities which is not an

Debt Liabilities accrued due and payable in cash in accordance with the terms of the relevant debt
documents for the Future Senior Subordinated Debt (together, the “Future Senior Subordinated
Debt Documents”), additional amounts payable as a result of the tax gross-up provisions relating

Creditors in respect of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities in accordance with the Future Senior
Subordinated Debt Documents.

_Payment Block—Future Senior Subordinated Debt_

Prior to the Senior Debt Discharge Date, if a Senior Debt Payment Default has occurred and is continuing, all
payments in respect of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities (other than any payment consented to by
the “Majority Super Super Senior Creditors,” the “Majority Super Senior Creditors” and the “Majority Senior
Secured Creditors” (each as defined below) and certain specified exceptions) are suspended.

Prior to the Senior Debt Discharge Date, if an event of default (other than a Senior Debt Payment Default) under
the finance documents in respect of the Senior Debt (a “Senior Default”) has occurred and is continuing, and

147


-----

either the Pension Guarantee Facility Agent, the creditor representative for any Pension Guarantee Facility, the
RCF Agent, the creditor representative for any Credit Facility (together the “Senior Agents” and each a “Senior
Agent”), the Senior Secured Notes Trustee or a creditor representative of Future Pari Passu Debt (as the case may
be) (each a “Relevant Representative”) has delivered a Payment Blockage Notice to the Issuer, the Security
Agent and creditor representative of the Future Senior Subordinated Creditors (the “Future Senior Subordinated
Debt Representative”), all payments in respect of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities (other than
those consented to by the Majority Super Super Senior Creditors, Majority Super Senior Creditors and Majority
Senior Secured Creditors and certain specified exceptions) are suspended until the earliest of:

(1) the date on which there is a waiver, remedy or cure of such Senior Default in accordance with the relevant
finance documents;

(2) the date on which a default under the Future Senior Subordinated Debt occurs for failure to pay principal at
the original scheduled maturity of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt;

(3) the date falling 179 days after the receipt by the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Representative of the
Payment Blockage Notice;

(4) if a “Standstill Period” (as defined below) is in effect at any time after delivery of a Payment Blockage
Notice, the date on which that Standstill Period expires;

(5) the date on which the relevant Senior Default is no longer continuing and, if the relevant Senior Debt has
been accelerated, such acceleration has been rescinded (and if such acceleration consisted solely of
declaring the relevant debt payable on demand such rescission can be effected by the relevant majority
creditors in respect of the relevant debt);

(6) the date on which the Relevant Representative which issued the Payment Blockage Notice (and, if at such
time a Senior Default is continuing (other than in relation to the Senior Debt in respect of which such notice
was given), the Relevant Representative(s) in respect of that other Senior Debt) delivers a notice to the
Issuer, the Security Agent and the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Representative cancelling that Payment
Blockage Notice;

(7) the Senior Debt Discharge Date; and

(8) the date on which the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Representative or the Security Agent takes any
Enforcement Action which it is permitted to take in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.

Unless the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Representative waives this requirement: (i) no new Payment
Blockage Notice may be served by a Relevant Representative unless 360 days have elapsed since the delivery of
the immediately prior Payment Blockage Notice; and (ii) no Payment Blockage Notice may be served in reliance
on a Senior Default more than 60 days after the date that the Relevant Representative received notice of that
Senior Default.

The Relevant Representative may only serve one Payment Blockage Notice with respect to the same event or set
of circumstances. Subject to the immediately preceding paragraph, this shall not affect the right of the Relevant
Representatives to issue a Payment Blockage Notice in respect of any other event or set of circumstances.

No Payment Blockage Notice may be served by a Relevant Representative in respect of a Senior Default which
had been notified to each of them at the time at which an earlier Payment Blockage Notice was issued.

_Cure of Payment Block—Future Senior Subordinated Creditors_

If:

(a) at any time following the issue of a Payment Blockage Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Debt Payment
Default, that Payment Blockage Notice ceases to be outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the Senior Debt
Payment Default ceases to be continuing; and

(b) the relevant Obligor then promptly pays to the Future Senior Subordinated Creditors an amount equal to any
payments which had accrued under any Future Senior Subordinated Debt Documents and which would have
otherwise been entitled to make but for that Payment Blockage Notice or Senior Debt Payment Default

(a “Permitted Post-Payment Blockage Payment”), then any event of default which may have occurred as a result
of that suspension of payments shall be waived and any “Future Senior Subordinated Debt Enforcement Notice”
(as defined below) which may have been issued as a result of that event of default shall be waived, in each case
without any further action being required on the part of the Future Senior Subordinated Creditors.

148

**_Enforcement Action_**

_Permitted enforcement by Future Senior Subordinated Creditors_

Prior to the Senior Debt Discharge Date, neither the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Representative nor the
Future Senior Subordinated Creditors may take or require the taking of an Enforcement Action with respect to
the Future Senior Subordinated Debt without the prior consent of or as required by an “Instructing Group” (as
defined below), except if:

(1) an event of default has occurred under a Future Senior Subordinated Debt finance agreement resulting from
failure to pay the principal amount of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities at final maturity; or

(2)

(a) an event of default under a Future Senior Subordinated Debt finance agreement is continuing (the
“Relevant Future Senior Subordinated Debt Event of Default”);

(b) each Relevant Representative has received notice of the Relevant Future Senior Subordinated Debt
Event of Default from the relevant Future Senior Subordinated Debt Representative;

(c) a Standstill Period has expired; and

(d) the Relevant Future Senior Subordinated Debt Event of Default is continuing at the end of the relevant
Standstill Period,

_provided that in the case of paragraph (2) above only, no such Enforcement Action may be taken if the Security_
Agent is acting in accordance with the instructions of the Instructing Group to take steps for Enforcement and
such proposed Enforcement Action in relation to the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Documents might
reasonably be likely to adversely affect such Enforcement Action by the Security Agent.

_Standstill on enforcement by Future Senior Subordinated Creditors_

A “Future Senior Subordinated Standstill Period” shall mean the period starting on the date that the Future
Senior Subordinated Debt Representative serves an enforcement notice (a “Future Senior Subordinated Debt
**Enforcement Notice”) on the Relevant Representatives until the earliest of:**

(a) 179 days after such date;

(b) the date on which the Security Agent takes any Enforcement Action, provided that (i) if the Future Senior
Subordinated Standstill Period ends pursuant to this paragraph (b), the Future Senior Subordinated Creditors
may only take the same Enforcement Action against the same entity as is taken by the Security Agent and
may not take any other action against any other member of the Group or Holdco and (ii) Enforcement
Action, for the purposes of this paragraph (b), shall not include action taken to preserve or protect any
security as opposed to realize it;

(c) the date on which an insolvency event occurs in respect of a particular Obligor owing Future Senior
Subordinated Debt Liabilities and against whom Enforcement Action is to be taken;

(d) the date on which an event of default under a Future Senior Subordinated Debt Document occurs for failure
to pay principal at the original scheduled maturity of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt; and

(e) the expiration of any other Future Senior Subordinated Standstill Period which was outstanding at the date
that the current Future Senior Subordinated Standstill Period commenced (other than as a result of a cure,
waiver or other permitted remedy thereof).

_Standstill on enforcement by Super Super Senior Creditors_

A “Pension Guarantee Standstill Period” shall mean the period starting on the date that the creditor
representative for any Pension Guarantee Facility serves an enforcement notice on the Relevant Representatives
until the earliest of:

(a) 120 days if they take enforcement action due to a payment default;

(b) 150 days if they take enforcement action due to any other event of default;

(c) the date on which the Security Agent takes any Enforcement Action, provided that (i) if the Pension
Guarantee Standstill Period ends pursuant to this paragraph (c), the Super Super Senior Creditors may only
take the same Enforcement Action against the same entity as is taken by the Security Agent and may not

149


-----

take any other action against any other member of the Group or Holdco and (ii) Enforcement Action, for the
purposes of this paragraph (c), shall not include action taken to preserve or protect any security as opposed
to realize it;

(d) the Majority Super Senior Secured Creditors and the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have given their
prior consent; or

(e) the date on which an insolvency event occurs in respect of a particular Obligor owing Super Super Senior
Liabilities and against whom Enforcement Action is to be taken.

_Composition of the instructing creditor groups_

The Intercreditor Agreement generally provides that the Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the
Transaction Security unless instructed otherwise by an Instructing Group. Each of the creditor groups referred to
below under this caption constitute an “Instructing Group” in relation to instructions with respect to any
Enforcement.

Prior to the date upon which all amounts (actual or contingent) owing under the (a) Revolving Credit and
Guarantee Facility and each other Credit Facility are fully discharged and paid in full and all commitments
thereunder are irrevocably cancelled (such date, the “RCF/Credit/Guarantee Facility Discharge Date”), (b) the
Pension Guarantee Facility and each other Additional Pension Guarantee Facility are fully discharged and paid in
full and all commitments thereunder are irrevocably cancelled (such date, the “Pension Guarantee Facility
Discharge Date”) and (c) Super Senior Hedging Liabilities are fully discharged and paid in full (“Super Senior
Hedging Discharge Date”), in relation to instructions with respect to any Enforcement, the Security Agent will
act on the instructions of, generally:

(1) the Pension Guarantee Lenders and any Additional Pension Guarantee Facility Lenders whose credit
participations represent more than 66 [2]⁄3% of the aggregate credit participations of all Pension Guarantee
Lenders and Additional Pension Guarantee Facility Lenders (the “Majority Super Super Senior Creditors”);

(2) the RCF and Guarantee Lenders, the Additional Credit Facility Lenders and the Super Senior Hedging
Banks whose credit participations represent more than 50% of the aggregate credit participations of all RCF
and Guarantee Lenders, Additional Credit Facility Lenders and Super Senior Hedging Banks (the “Majority
Super Senior Creditors”); and/or

(3) the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, the Future Pari Passu Debt Creditors and the Pari Passu Hedging
Banks whose aggregate credit participations represent more than 50% of the aggregate credit participations
of all holders of Senior Secured Notes, Future Pari Passu Debt Creditors and Pari Passu Hedging Banks (the
“Majority Senior Secured Creditors”),

in each case subject to a consultation period referred to under the caption “—Consultation” below and provided
that such instructions are consistent with the “Security Enforcement Principles” (as defined below) as generally
described below under the caption “—Security Enforcement Principles”

Following the RCF/Credit/Guarantee Facility Discharge Date, the Pension Guarantee Facility Discharge Date
and the Super Senior Hedging Discharge Date but prior to the Senior Debt Discharge Date, the Security Agent
will act on the instructions of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors which would, solely for this purpose,
include all Super Senior Hedging Banks (if any).

Following the Senior Debt Discharge Date, the Security Agent will act on the instructions of the “Majority
Senior Subordinated Creditors” (being, at any time, those Future Senior Subordinated Creditors whose credit
participations at that time aggregate more than 50% of the aggregate credit participations of all Future Senior
Subordinated Creditors).

_Consultation_

Prior to giving any instructions to the Security Agent to commence enforcement of all or part of the Transaction
Security and/or the requesting of a “distressed disposal” and/or the release or disposal of claims or Transaction
Security on a distressed disposal (each an “Enforcement”), the relevant creditor representative(s) of the Majority
Super Super Senior Creditors, the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors shall
first notify the Security Agent and the creditor representative for each of the, Super Super Senior Creditors, the
Super Senior Creditors and each of the Senior Secured Creditors that the applicable Transaction Security has
become enforceable.

150


-----

As soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of such a notice instructing the Security Agent to solicit
instructions to enforce the Transaction Security or take any other Enforcement Action given by (subject to the
Super Super Senior Creditors being entitled to take Enforcement Actions as generally described below under the
caption “—Standstill on enforcement by Super Super Senior Creditors”) the Majority Super Super Senior
Creditors, the Majority Super Senior Creditors and/or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (as the case may
be), the Security Agent shall distribute such notice to the relevant addressees promptly upon receipt, following
which, each Senior Agent (acting on the instructions of the Majority Super Senior Creditors and/or the Majority
Super Super Senior Creditors (as the case may be)), the Senior Secured Notes Trustee and the creditor
representative(s) of the Future Pari Passu Debt Creditors will consult in good faith with each other and the
Security Agent for a period of 15 days from the date such notice is received by such persons (or such shorter
period as the relevant parties may agree) (the “Consultation Period”) with a view to coordinating the instructions
to be given by an Instructing Group and agreeing an enforcement strategy.

Generally, no such consultation shall be required (and an Instructing Group shall be entitled to give any
instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security or take any other Enforcement Action prior
to the end of the Consultation Period, in each case provided such instructions comply with the Security
Enforcement Principles (“Qualifying Instructions”)) where:

(a) the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an insolvency event affecting Holdco, the
Issuer or any Obligor (owing liabilities to any Primary Creditor or the Issuer) or any “significant subsidiary”
or “significant group” (as applicable) (each a “Relevant Company”); or

(b) the Majority Super Super Senior Creditors, the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior
Secured Creditors determine in good faith (and notify the creditor representatives of each of the other

not commenced any Enforcement (or any transaction in lieu) or other Enforcement Action at that time with
respect to such Relevant Company, then, in relation to instructions with respect to any Enforcement, the

_Security Enforcement Principles_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that enforcement of the Transaction Security must be conducted in
accordance with the “Security Enforcement Principles,” which principles shall include the following:

(a) It shall be the aim of any Enforcement of the Transaction Security to maximize, so far as is consistent with a
prompt and expeditious realization of value from Enforcement of the Transaction Security, and in a manner
consistent with the Intercreditor Agreement, the recovery of the Pension Guarantee Lenders and Additional
Pension Guarantee Facility Lenders, the RCF and Guarantee Lenders and Additional Credit Facility
Lenders, the Hedging Banks, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and their representatives, the Future
Pari Passu Debt Creditors and their representatives and the Future Senior Subordinated Creditors (to the
extent the Transaction Security is expressed to secure such debt) and their representatives (the “Security
Enforcement Objective”).

(b) Without prejudice to the Security Enforcement Objective, the Transaction Security is enforced and any other
action as to Enforcement is taken such that either:

(i) all proceeds of Enforcement are received by the Security Agent in cash (or substantially all cash) for
distribution in accordance with the Payments Waterfall; or

(ii) sufficient proceeds of Enforcement is received by the Security Agent in cash to ensure that when the
proceeds are applied in accordance with the Payments Waterfall, first, the Super Super Senior
Liabilities are repaid and discharged in full (unless the Majority Super Super Senior Creditors agree
otherwise) and second, the Super Senior Liabilities are repaid and discharged in full (unless the
Majority Super Senior Creditors agree otherwise).

(c) On:

(i) a proposed Enforcement of any of the Transaction Security over assets other than shares in a member
of the Group, where the aggregate book value of such assets exceeds €5.0 million (or its equivalent); or

(ii) a proposed Enforcement of any of the Transaction Security over some or all of the shares in a member
of the Group over which Transaction Security exists,

the Security Agent shall (unless such enforcement is made pursuant to a public auction or process supervised by
a court of law which makes a determination as to value) obtain an opinion from a reputable internationally
recognized investment bank or international accounting firm or other reputable, third-party professional firm that
is regularly engaged in providing valuations of businesses or assets similar or comparable to those charged under
the Transaction Security to be enforced (a “Financial Advisor”) to opine as expert:

(A) on the optimal method of enforcing the Transaction Security so as to achieve the Security Enforcement
Objective and maximize the recovery of any such Enforcement Action;

(B) that the proceeds received from Enforcement are fair from a financial point of view after taking into
account all relevant circumstances; and

(C) that such sale is otherwise in accordance with the Security Enforcement Objective.

(d) The Security Agent shall be under no obligation to appoint a Financial Advisor or to seek the advice of a
Financial Advisor, unless expressly required to do so by the Intercreditor Agreement or any other provision
of the Intercreditor Agreement. It is understood that the Financial Advisor may limit its liability in respect of
the opinion referred to in (c) above to the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement.

152


-----

Generally, the Security Enforcement Principles may be amended, varied or waived with the prior written consent
of the Issuer, the Majority Super Super Senior Creditors, the Majority Super Senior Creditors, the requisite
holders of the Senior Secured Notes (as determined under the Indenture or, if not addressed thereunder, with the
approval of at least a majority of such Senior Secured Notes Liabilities); and the requisite Future Pari Passu Debt
Creditors (as determined under the relevant finance documents for such Future Pari Passu Debt or, if not
addressed thereunder, with the approval of at least a majority of such Future Pari Passu Debt Liabilities).

**_Turnover_**

The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that, subject to certain exceptions, if any Primary Creditor receives or
recovers the proceeds of any enforcement of any Transaction Security applied other than in accordance with the
Payments Waterfall, it shall:

Š in relation to receipts or recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off: (i) hold that amount on trust
for the Security Agent and separate from other assets, property or funds and promptly pay that amount or an
amount equal to that amount to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement; and (ii) promptly pay an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which receipt or
recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities owed to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

Š in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an amount equal
to that receipt or recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Disposals_**

_Non-distressed Disposals_

Generally, in circumstances where a disposal or certain other specified transactions (including mergers,
reorganizations and other transactions) are not being effected pursuant to a “Distress Event” (as defined below)
(a disposal effected pursuant to a Distress Event being a “Distressed Disposal”) and are otherwise permitted by
the terms of the Indenture, the finance documents for the Pension Guarantee Facilities, any Additional Pension
Facilities, Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facility, any Credit Facilities and any Future Pari Passu Debt and the
Future Senior Subordinated Debt Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent is
authorized: (i) to release the Transaction Security (and in connection with such release, execute any related
documents); and (ii) if the relevant asset consists of shares in the capital of an Obligor, to release the Transaction
Security or any other claim in respect of the liabilities secured by the Transaction Security over the assets of that
Obligor and the shares in and assets of any of its subsidiaries (and in connection with such release, execute any

Where a Distressed Disposal of an asset is being effected, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security
Agent is authorized:

(a) to release the Transaction Security, or any other claim over the relevant asset;

(b) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of an Obligor, to release: (i) that Obligor

Security Agent (provided that it is acting in accordance with the Security Enforcement Principles) the
disposal, to third parties, of creditors’ claims against that Obligor or holding company (which may include
claims against the Issuer).

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected such that the claims of the holders of the Future Senior Subordinated
Debt Liabilities and Transaction Security over shares in (and any shareholder loans to) the Issuer or assets of a
guarantor of Future Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities or the Issuer is released, it is a further condition to the
release that either:

(i) the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Representative has approved the release on the instructions of the
requisite Future Senior Subordinated Debt Creditors (as determined under the relevant Future Senior
Subordinated Debt Documents or, if not addressed thereunder, with the approval of at least a majority of
such Future Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities); or

(ii) each of the following conditions are satisfied:

(A) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash);

(B) all present and future obligations owed to the relevant secured parties under the Senior Debt finance
documents by a member of the Group, all of whose shares are pledged under the Transaction Security
are sold or disposed of pursuant to such Enforcement Action, are unconditionally released and
discharged or sold or disposed of concurrently with such sale (and such obligations are not assumed by
the purchaser or one of its affiliates), and all Transaction Security in respect of the assets that are sold
or disposed of is simultaneously and unconditionally released concurrently with such sale; and

(C) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made:

(I) pursuant to a public auction; or

accountants selected by the Security Agent has delivered an opinion in respect of such sale or
disposal that the amount received in connection therewith is fair from a financial point of view
taking into account all relevant circumstances including the method of enforcement and the
circumstances giving rise to such sale, provided that the liability of such investment bank or
internationally recognized firm of accountants in giving such opinion may be limited to the
amount of its fees in respect of such engagement.

The net proceeds of a Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities) shall be paid to the
Security Agent (as the case may be) for application in accordance with the provisions set forth under
“—Application of Proceeds/Waterfall” above as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of the
Transaction Security and, to the extent that any disposal of liabilities has occurred, as if the disposal of liabilities

**DESCRIPTION OF THE TEMPORARY NOTES**

The Issuer will issue €100.0 million in aggregate principal amount of temporary Senior Secured Floating Rate
Notes due 2025 (the “Temporary Notes”) under an indenture (the “Temporary Indenture”) dated as of the Issue
Date, between, inter alios, the Issuer, Deutsche Trustee Company Limited, as trustee (the “Temporary Trustee”),
and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as security agent (the “Security Agent”) and as paying agent. The
Temporary Indenture will not be qualified under, will not incorporate or include, by reference or otherwise, and
will not be subject to, any of the provisions of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. The Issuer will
issue the Temporary Notes in minimum denominations of €100,000 and any integral multiple of €1,000 in excess
thereof. The issue price of the Temporary Notes is 100.000% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued
interest, if any, from December 15, 2020 to, but excluding, the Issue Date. Interest on the Temporary Notes will
accrue as described under “—Interest.”

Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings ascribed thereto under
“Description of the Notes.”

Subject to certain conditions described herein, the Temporary Notes will be automatically exchanged (the
“Temporary Notes Exchange”) for additional notes (the “Additional Notes”) (which will be established by way
of supplemental indenture and additional global notes) in equal aggregate principal amount to be issued by the
Issuer, the terms and conditions of which are more fully described in this offering memorandum under
“Description of the Notes.” The Additional Notes will have the same terms as the Original Notes and will be
treated as a single class together with the Original Notes for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without
limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. However, the Temporary Notes will trade
separately from the Original Notes, will have different ISIN/common code numbers than the Original Notes and
will not be fungible with the Original Notes.

The terms and conditions of the Temporary Notes include those stated in the Indenture and are substantially the
same as the terms and conditions of the Original Notes, except:

Š on or about the Completion Date after the Release, the Temporary Notes will be automatically exchanged
for an equal aggregate principal amount of Additional Notes issued under the Indenture governing the
Original Notes, which Additional Notes will have the same terms as the Original Notes and will be treated
as a single class together with the Original Notes for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without
limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase;

Š upon the Temporary Notes Exchange, the Temporary Notes will be cancelled;

Š if the Fidelix Acquisition is not consummated for any reason on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date or if
certain other events occur, as described below, the Issuer will be required to redeem the Temporary Notes at
a redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price of the Temporary Notes, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and Additional Amounts from the Issue Date to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory
Redemption Date (as defined below), if any;

Š the Temporary Notes will not be guaranteed, and will not contain a covenant requiring Restricted
Subsidiaries that guarantee other indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor to guarantee, and provide
security in respect of, the Temporary Notes;

Š the Temporary Notes will be secured solely by a first-priority security interest over the Issuer’s interest in
the Escrow Account;

Š the Temporary Indenture will require an Asset Sale Offer to be made in respect of the Original Notes rather
than the Temporary Notes;

Š the Issuer may not issue any additional Temporary Notes under the Temporary Indenture unless the gross
proceeds of such additional Temporary Notes are deposited in the Escrow Account;

Š the security interest over the escrow account may only be enforced (a) upon the failure by the Issuer to
consummate a Special Mandatory Redemption on the Special Mandatory Redemption Date as described
below or (b) if the Lien purported to be granted over the Escrow Account in favor of the Temporary Trustee
or the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders of the Temporary Notes being held in any
non-appealable judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid;

Š the amendments provisions of the Temporary Indenture will allow amendments, waivers and supplements to
the Escrow Agreement to be made without the consent of any holder of Temporary Notes, except for
amendments, waivers and supplements that would be adverse to the legal rights of holders of Temporary
Notes in any material respect (as determined by the Issuer in good faith), which will require the consent of
holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Temporary Notes then outstanding; and

157


-----

Š the Temporary Notes will trade separately from the Original Notes, will have different ISIN/common code
numbers than the Original Notes and will not be fungible with the Original Note. Application will be made
to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”) for the separate listing of, and
permission to deal in, the Temporary Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the
“Exchange”).

The supplemental indenture signed with respect to the Additional Notes shall set forth the requirements for the
establishment of the guarantees and collateral set out under “Description of the Notes—Guarantees” and
“Description of the Notes—Security.”

**Interest**

Interest on the Temporary Notes will accrue at a rate per annum (the “Applicable Rate”), reset quarterly, equal to
the sum of (i) three-month EURIBOR (and if that rate is less than zero, EURIBOR shall be deemed to be zero)
plus (ii) 5.0%, as determined by the calculation agent (the “Calculation Agent”), who shall initially be Deutsche
Bank AG, London Branch. Interest on the Temporary Notes will:

Š accrue from December 15, 2020;

Š be payable quarterly in arrear on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15, commencing on
March 15, 2021;

Š be payable to the Holder of record of such Temporary Notes on the business day immediately preceding the
related interest payment date; and

Š be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed.

Set forth below is a summary of certain of the provisions from the Temporary Indenture relating to the
calculation of interest on the Temporary Notes.

“Determination Date” means, with respect to an Interest Period, the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days
preceding the first day of such Interest Period.

“EURIBOR” means, with respect to an Interest Period, the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for
deposits in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the
Determination Date that appears on Reuters Page 248 as of 11:00 a.m. Brussels time, on the Determination Date.
If Reuters Page 248 does not include such a rate or is unavailable on a Determination Date, the Issuer will request
the principal London or Frankfurt office of each of four major banks in the euro-zone inter-bank market, as
selected by the Issuer, to provide such bank’s offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of
approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such Determination Date, to prime banks in the euro-zone inter-bank
market for deposits in a Representative Amount in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two
TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so provided,
the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations
are so provided, the Issuer will request that each of three major banks in London or Frankfurt, as selected by the
Issuer, to provide such bank’s rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m.,
London time, on such Determination Date, for loans in a Representative Amount in euro to leading European
banks for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the
Determination Date. If at least two such rates are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the
arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than two such rates are so provided, then the rate for the Interest Period
will be the rate in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period.

If the Issuer determines, prior to any Determination Date, that:

(4) there has been a material disruption to EURIBOR;

(5) EURIBOR is not available for use temporarily, indefinitely or permanently;

(6) there are restrictions or prohibitions on the use of EURIBOR;

(7) an alternative rate has replaced EURIBOR in customary market practice in the international capital
markets applicable generally to floating rate notes; or

(8) it has become unlawful for the Calculation Agent, the Issuer or a third party agent of the Issuer to
calculate any payments due to Holders using EURIBOR (each, a “EURIBOR Phase-Out Event”),

a Rate Determination Agent, acting in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, shall select a
successor rate to EURIBOR that is substantially comparable to EURIBOR or that has been recommended or
selected by the relevant monetary authority or similar authority (or working group thereof) or by a widely

158


-----

recognized industry association or body or that is expected to develop as an industry accepted rate for debt
market instruments such as or comparable to the Notes, as more fully set forth in the Indenture (and any
applicable adjustment spread required to reduce or eliminate, to the extent reasonably practicable in the
circumstances, any economic prejudice or benefit (as the case may be) to Holders as a result of the replacement
of EURIBOR (the “Adjustment Spread”)) for use in calculating the Applicable Rate (the “Successor Rate”), and
the Issuer shall certify (by way of an Officer’s Certificate) to each of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and the
Paying Agent, at least five Business Days prior to any Determination Date, such Successor Rate (and the
Adjustment Spread) (upon which each of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and Paying Agent shall be entitled to
rely conclusively and absolutely without further enquiry, investigation, verification or liability of any kind
whatsoever), which shall be used by the Calculation Agent to calculate the Applicable Rate. Holders shall be
bound by any such Successor Rate (and Adjustment Spread) without any further action or consent by the Holders
or the Trustee. For the avoidance of doubt, the sum of the Successor Rate and the Adjustment Spread shall, in all
cases, not be less than 0%. The Issuer shall promptly notify the Holders of the adoption of any Successor Rate
(and Adjustment Spread). Following the adoption of any Successor Rate and Adjustment Spread, all references to
“EURIBOR” in the Indenture shall be deemed to refer to such Successor Rate (and such Adjustment Spread).

“euro-zone” means the region comprising of the member states of the European Union at such time that use the
euro as their official currency.

“Interest Period” means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and ending on and
including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest payment date, with the exception that the
first Interest Period for the Temporary Notes shall commence on and include December 15, 2020 and end on and
include March 14, 2021.

“Rate Determination Agent” means (a) an independent financial institution of international standing or an
independent financial adviser of recognized standing (that is not an Affiliate of the Issuer) as appointed by the
Issuer at the expense of the Issuer or (b) if it is not reasonably practicable to appoint a party as referred to under
(a), the Issuer.

“Representative Amount” means the greater of (i) €1,000,000 and (ii) an amount that is representative for a
single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time.

“Reuters Page 248” means the display page so designated on Reuters (or such other page as may replace that
page on that service, or, if no such page is available, such other service as may be nominated as the information
vendor).

“TARGET Settlement Day” means any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross
Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET) System is open for the settlement of payments in euro.

The Calculation Agent shall, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (Brussels time) on each Determination Date,
determine the Applicable Rate and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable in respect of the following
Interest Period (the “Interest Amount”). The Interest Amount shall be calculated by applying the Applicable Rate
to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding at the commencement of the Interest Period,
multiplying such amount by the actual amounts of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 360. All
percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred
thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g.
4.876545% (or .04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or .0487655). All euro amounts used in or resulting from
such calculations will be rounded to the nearest euro cent (with one half euro cent being rounded upwards). The
determination of the Applicable Rate and the Interest Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of
willful default, fraud or manifest error, be final and binding on all parties. In no event will the rate of interest on
the Notes be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, provided, however, that the Calculation
Agent shall not be responsible for verifying that the rate of interest on the Additional Notes is permitted under
any applicable law.

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption**

Concurrently with the closing of the Offering on the Issue Date, the Issuer will enter into the Escrow Agreement
with the Temporary Trustee and the Escrow Agent, pursuant to which the Initial Purchasers will deposit with the
Escrow Agent an amount equal to the gross proceeds of the Offering sold on the Issue Date into the Escrow
Account. The Escrow Account, together with the Escrowed Property, will be pledged on a first-priority basis in

159


-----

favor of the Temporary Trustee or the Security Agent for the benefit of the holders of the Temporary Notes,
pursuant to an escrow account charge dated the Issue Date between the Issuer, the Escrow Agent and the
Temporary Trustee (the “Escrow Account Charge”). The initial funds deposited in the Escrow Account, and all
other funds, securities, interest, dividends, distributions and other property and payments credited to the Escrow
Account (less any property and/or funds released in accordance with the Escrow Agreement) are referred to,
collectively, as the “Escrowed Property.”

In order to cause the Escrow Agent to release the Escrowed Property to the Issuer (the “Release”), the Escrow
Agent and the Temporary Trustee shall have received from the Issuer, at a time that is on or before the Escrow
Longstop Date, an Officer’s Certificate, upon which both the Escrow Agent and the Temporary Trustee shall
rely, without further investigation, to the effect that:

 - the Fidelix Acquisition will be consummated promptly following release of the Escrowed Property;

 - immediately after consummation of the Fidelix Acquisition, the Issuer will own, directly or indirectly,
substantially all of the share capital of the Target (or other holding company of the Target Group);

 - since the Issue Date, no material term or condition of the Fidelix Acquisition Agreement has been amended
or waived in a manner or to an extent that would be materially prejudicial to the interests of the holders of
the Temporary Notes (taken as a whole) under the Temporary Indenture (other than any amendment or
waiver approved by holders of more than 50% of the outstanding principal amount of the Temporary Notes
the proceeds of which are in the Escrow Account); and

 - as at the date of such Officer’s Certificate, there is no Event of Default with respect to the Issuer under
clause (5) of the first paragraph under the heading titled “Description of the Notes—Events of Default.”

The Release shall occur promptly upon the delivery of the Officer’s Certificate set forth above. Upon the
Release, the balance of the Escrow Account shall be reduced to zero, and the Escrowed Property shall be released
in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

In the event that (a) the Release does not take place on or prior to September 3, 2021 (the “Escrow Longstop
Date”), (b) in the reasonable judgment of the Issuer, the Fidelix Acquisition will not be consummated on or prior
the Escrow Longstop Date or the Issuer or one of its subsidiaries has announced its intention to abandon the
Fidelix Acquisition, (c) the Fidelix Acquisition Agreement terminates at any time prior to the Escrow Longstop
Date or (d) there is an Event of Default with respect to the Issuer under clause (5) of the first paragraph under the
heading titled “Description of the Notes—Events of Default” (the date of any such event being the “Special
Termination Date”), the Issuer will redeem all of the Temporary Notes (the “Special Mandatory Redemption”) at
a price (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Price”) equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price of the Temporary
Notes, plus accrued but unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to, but excluding,
the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

Notice of the Special Mandatory Redemption will be delivered by the Issuer, no later than one Business Day
following the Special Termination Date, to the Temporary Trustee and the Escrow Agent, and will provide that
the Temporary Notes shall be redeemed on a date that is no later than the fifth Business Day after such notice is
given by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement (the “Special Mandatory Redemption
Date”). On the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Paying Agent for
payment to each holder of the Temporary Notes the Special Mandatory Redemption Price for such holder’s
Temporary Notes and, concurrently with the payment to such holders, deliver any excess Escrowed Property (if
any) to the Issuer. If the aggregate Special Mandatory Redemption Price for all Temporary Notes to be redeemed
in the Special Mandatory Redemption exceeds the amount of the Escrowed Property, the Issuer will be required
to pay to the holders of the Temporary Notes any shortfall.

**Security**

To secure the payment of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price, on the Issue Date, the Issuer will grant to the
Temporary Trustee or the Security Agent for the benefit of the holders of the Temporary Notes a first-priority
security interest over the Escrow Account pursuant to the Escrow Charge.

160


-----

Receipt by the Temporary Trustee of either an Officer’s Certificate for the release or a notice of Special
Mandatory Redemption (provided funds sufficient to pay the Special Mandatory Redemption Price are in the
Escrow Account) shall constitute deemed consent by the Temporary Trustee for the release of the Escrowed
Property from the Escrow Account Charge.

No provisions of the Escrow Agreement and, to the extent such provisions relate to the Issuer’s obligation to
redeem the Temporary Notes in a Special Mandatory Redemption, the Temporary Indenture, may be waived or
modified in any manner materially adverse to the holders without the consent of holders of a majority of the
outstanding Temporary Notes. By accepting a Temporary Note, each holder will be deemed to have agreed to be
bound by the terms of the Escrow Agreement and have irrevocably authorized the Temporary Trustee to take all
the actions set forth in the Escrow Agreement without the need for further direction from them under the
Temporary Indenture.

The Escrow Agreement will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of England and Wales.
The Escrow Charge will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of Sweden.

**Listing**

If at the time of such Special Mandatory Redemption, the Temporary Notes are listed on the Exchange and to the
extent that the rules and regulations of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange that the
Special Mandatory Redemption has occurred and any relevant details relating to such Special Mandatory
Redemption.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

You will find definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this “Description of the Notes” under the heading
“Certain Definitions.” For purposes of this “Description of the Notes,” references to “we,” “our,” and “us” refer
to the Issuer and its subsidiaries and references to the “Issuer” refer to Assemblin Financing AB.

Upon the exchange of the Temporary Notes as described in “Description of the Temporary Notes,” the Issuer will
issue €100.0 million aggregate principal amount of Additional Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2025 (the
“Additional Notes”). The Issuer will issue the Additional Notes under an indenture dated December 6, 2019 (the
“Indenture”), between, inter alios, the Issuer, Deutsche Trustee Company Limited, as trustee (the “Trustee”), and
Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as security agent (the “Security Agent”) and as paying agent pursuant to
which the Issuer issued €250.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due
2025 (the “Original Notes” and, together with the Additional Notes, the “Notes”). The Additional Notes will vote
as a single class with the Original Notes for all purposes under the Indenture (including waivers, amendments,
redemptions and offers to purchase).

The Indenture has not been qualified under, does not incorporate or include, by reference or otherwise, and is not
subject to, any of the provisions of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

The proceeds of the offering of the Temporary Notes sold on the Issue Date (and exchanged on or about the
Completion Date for an equal aggregate principal amount of Additional Notes) will be used to pay the cash
consideration for the Target in connection with the Fidelix Acquisition, to pay transaction costs associated with
the Transactions and to fund cash on balance sheet, including potential acquisitions, as set forth in the Offering
Memorandum under the caption “Use of Proceeds.”

The Indenture is unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which €100.0 million aggregate principal amount of
Additional Notes will be issued in this Offering and €250.0 million was issued as the Original Notes on the
Original Notes Issue Date. We may, subject to applicable law, issue an unlimited principal amount of subsequent
additional Notes having identical terms and conditions as the Notes (the “Subsequent Additional Notes”);
provided that, if the Subsequent Additional Notes are not fungible with either the Original Notes or the
Additional Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such Subsequent Additional Notes will be issued with a
separate ISIN code or common code, as applicable, from the Original Notes or the Additional Notes, as
applicable. We will only be permitted to issue Subsequent Additional Notes in compliance with the covenants
contained in the Indenture, including the covenant restricting the Incurrence of Indebtedness (as described below
under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”). Except with respect to right of payment and
optional redemption, and as otherwise provided for in the Indenture, the Additional Notes issued in this Offering,
the Original Notes and, if issued, any Subsequent Additional Notes, will be treated as a single class for all
purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to waivers, amendments, redemptions
and offers to purchase. Unless the context otherwise requires, in this “Description of the Notes,” references to the
“Notes” include the Original Notes, the Additional Notes and any Subsequent Additional Notes that are actually
issued.

The Indenture is subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and will be subject to any Additional
Intercreditor Agreements (each as defined below). The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to
understanding the terms and ranking of the Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes. See “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” for a description of the material terms of the_
Intercreditor Agreement.

This “Description of the Notes” is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Notes, the
Indenture and the Security Documents, and it refers to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Since
this description of the terms of the Notes is only a summary, you should refer to the Notes, the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents for complete descriptions of the obligations of the Issuer
and your rights. Copies of the Indenture are available from us upon request.

The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered Holders will
have rights under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to enforcement and the pursuit of
other remedies. The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act and are subject to
certain transfer restrictions.

applicable Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness;

 - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of the applicable
Guarantor that do not Guarantee the Notes; and

 - be subject to the limitations described herein and in “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the
_Collateral—The Notes Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to certain_
_limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may_
_limit their validity and enforceability” and “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the_
_Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

**Principal and Maturity**

The Issuer will issue €100.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Temporary Notes on the Issue Date, which
will be automatically exchanged for Additional Notes on or about the Completion Date. The Additional Notes
will mature on May 15, 2025. The Additional Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and
in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

163


-----

**Interest**

Interest on the Additional Notes will accrue at a rate per annum (the “Applicable Rate”), reset quarterly, equal to
the sum of (i) three-month EURIBOR (and if that rate is less than zero, EURIBOR shall be deemed to be zero)
plus (ii) 5.0%, as determined by the calculation agent (the “Calculation Agent”), who shall initially be Deutsche
Bank AG, London Branch. Interest on the Additional Notes will:

 - accrue from December 15, 2020;

 - be payable quarterly in arrear on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15, commencing on
March 15, 2021;

 - be payable to the Holder of record of such Additional Notes on the business day immediately preceding the
related interest payment date; and

 - be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed.

Set forth below is a summary of certain of the provisions from the Indenture relating to the calculation of interest
on the Notes.

“Determination Date” means, with respect to an Interest Period, the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days
preceding the first day of such Interest Period.

“EURIBOR” means, with respect to an Interest Period, the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for
deposits in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the
Determination Date that appears on Reuters Page 248 as of 11:00 a.m. Brussels time, on the Determination Date.
If Reuters Page 248 does not include such a rate or is unavailable on a Determination Date, the Issuer will request
the principal London or Frankfurt office of each of four major banks in the euro-zone inter-bank market, as
selected by the Issuer, to provide such bank’s offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of
approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such Determination Date, to prime banks in the euro-zone inter-bank
market for deposits in a Representative Amount in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two
TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so provided,
the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations
are so provided, the Issuer will request that each of three major banks in London or Frankfurt, as selected by the
Issuer, to provide such bank’s rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m.,
London time, on such Determination Date, for loans in a Representative Amount in euro to leading European
banks for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the
Determination Date. If at least two such rates are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the
arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than two such rates are so provided, then the rate for the Interest Period
will be the rate in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period.

If the Issuer determines, prior to any Determination Date, that:

(1) there has been a material disruption to EURIBOR;

(2) EURIBOR is not available for use temporarily, indefinitely or permanently;

(3) there are restrictions or prohibitions on the use of EURIBOR;

(4) an alternative rate has replaced EURIBOR in customary market practice in the international capital
markets applicable generally to floating rate notes; or

(5) it has become unlawful for the Calculation Agent, the Issuer or a third party agent of the Issuer to
calculate any payments due to Holders using EURIBOR (each, a “EURIBOR Phase-Out Event”),

a Rate Determination Agent, acting in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, shall select a
successor rate to EURIBOR that is substantially comparable to EURIBOR or that has been recommended or
selected by the relevant monetary authority or similar authority (or working group thereof) or by a widely
recognized industry association or body or that is expected to develop as an industry accepted rate for debt
market instruments such as or comparable to the Notes, as more fully set forth in the Indenture (and any
applicable adjustment spread required to reduce or eliminate, to the extent reasonably practicable in the
circumstances, any economic prejudice or benefit (as the case may be) to Holders as a result of the replacement
of EURIBOR (the “Adjustment Spread”)) for use in calculating the Applicable Rate (the “Successor Rate”), and
the Issuer shall certify (by way of an Officer’s Certificate) to each of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and the
Paying Agent, at least five Business Days prior to any Determination Date, such Successor Rate (and the

164


-----

Adjustment Spread) (upon which each of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and Paying Agent shall be entitled to
rely conclusively and absolutely without further enquiry, investigation, verification or liability of any kind
whatsoever), which shall be used by the Calculation Agent to calculate the Applicable Rate. Holders shall be
bound by any such Successor Rate (and Adjustment Spread) without any further action or consent by the Holders
or the Trustee. For the avoidance of doubt, the sum of the Successor Rate and the Adjustment Spread shall, in all
cases, not be less than 0%. The Issuer shall promptly notify the Holders of the adoption of any Successor Rate
(and Adjustment Spread). Following the adoption of any Successor Rate and Adjustment Spread, all references to
“EURIBOR” in the Indenture shall be deemed to refer to such Successor Rate (and such Adjustment Spread).

“euro-zone” means the region comprising of the member states of the European Union at such time that use the
euro as their official currency.

“Interest Period” means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and ending on and
including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest payment date, with the exception that the
first Interest Period for the Additional Notes shall commence on and include December 15, 2020 and end on and
include March 14, 2021.

“Rate Determination Agent” means (a) an independent financial institution of international standing or an
independent financial adviser of recognized standing (that is not an Affiliate of the Issuer) as appointed by the
Issuer at the expense of the Issuer or (b) if it is not reasonably practicable to appoint a party as referred to under
(a), the Issuer.

“Representative Amount” means the greater of (i) €1,000,000 and (ii) an amount that is representative for a
single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time.

“Reuters Page 248” means the display page so designated on Reuters (or such other page as may replace that
page on that service, or, if no such page is available, such other service as may be nominated as the information
vendor).

“TARGET Settlement Day” means any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross
Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET) System is open for the settlement of payments in euro.

The Calculation Agent shall, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (Brussels time) on each Determination Date,
determine the Applicable Rate and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable in respect of the following
Interest Period (the “Interest Amount”). The Interest Amount shall be calculated by applying the Applicable Rate
to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding at the commencement of the Interest Period,
multiplying such amount by the actual amounts of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 360. All
percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred
thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g.
4.876545% (or .04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or .0487655). All euro amounts used in or resulting from
such calculations will be rounded to the nearest euro cent (with one half euro cent being rounded upwards). The
determination of the Applicable Rate and the Interest Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of
willful default, fraud or manifest error, be final and binding on all parties. In no event will the rate of interest on
the Notes be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, provided, however, that the Calculation
Agent shall not be responsible for verifying that the rate of interest on the Additional Notes is permitted under
any applicable law.

The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on such Notes are subject to applicable procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day at the
place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount
due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other
payment as a result of any such delay.

**_Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes_**

Principal, interest and premium, if any, on the Global Notes (as defined below) will be payable at the specified
office or agency of one or more Paying Agents; provided that all such payments with respect to the Notes
represented by one or more Global Note registered in the name of or held by a nominee of a common depositary
for Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account specified by the Holder or Holders thereof.

165


-----

Principal, interest, premium and Additional Amounts if any, on any certificated securities (“Definitive Registered
_Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents maintained for such_
purposes. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be paid by check mailed to the person
entitled thereto as shown on the register for the Definitive Registered Notes. See “—Paying Agent and Registrar
_for the Notes.”_

**_Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes_**

The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Notes. The Initial Paying Agent is Deutsche Bank
AG, London Branch (the “Paying Agent”).

The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”) and a transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”). The initial
Registrar and Transfer Agent is Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. The Registrar and Transfer Agent will
maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and will make
payments on and facilitate transfers of the Notes on behalf of the Issuer.

The Issuer may change any Paying Agents, Registrars or Transfer Agents for the Notes without prior notice to
the Holders of such Notes. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect
of the Notes.

**Guarantees**

Upon the Temporary Notes Exchange, the obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Additional Notes, including
any payment obligation resulting from a Change of Control, will (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) be
guaranteed, jointly and severally on a senior basis, by each Subsidiary of the Issuer that is a guarantor under the
Pension Guarantee Facility and the Super Senior Facilities, including Assemblin Holding AB, Assemblin AB,
Assemblin Sweden AB, Assemblin Holding AS, Assemblin El AB, Assemblin VS AB, Assemblin Ventilation
AB, Assemblin AS and Assemblin Installation AB (the “Initial Guarantors”). As of and for the twelve months
ended September 30, 2020, the Initial Guarantors represented 90% of our net revenues, 88% of our EBITDA and
over 100% of our assets (other than goodwill and shares in subsidiaries), in each case, calculated on a stand-alone
basis without giving effect to intergroup eliminations.

The obligations of the Guarantors will be contractually limited under the applicable Guarantees to reflect
limitations under applicable law with respect to maintenance of share capital, corporate benefit, fraudulent
conveyance and other legal restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and their respective shareholders, directors
and general partners. For a description of such contractual limitations, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
_Notes and the Collateral—The Notes Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to certain_
_limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit_
_their validity and enforceability,” “—The Notes Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Notes will be subject_
_to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that_
_may limit their validity and enforceability” and “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the_
_Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

A significant portion of the operations of the Issuer will be conducted through its Restricted Subsidiaries. Claims
of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors
holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority
stockholders (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and
earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including
Holders of the Notes. The Notes and each Guarantee therefore will be effectively subordinated to creditors
(including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of Restricted Subsidiaries of the
Issuer (other than the Guarantors). For the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, our Non-Guarantor
Restricted Subsidiaries represented approximately 10% of our net revenues, 12% of our EBITDA and none of
our assets (other than goodwill and shares in subsidiaries), in each case, calculated on a stand-alone basis without
giving effect to intergroup eliminations. On an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions as of
September 30, 2020, the Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer that will not guarantee the Notes would have had
less than SEK 10 million outstanding financial indebtedness. Although the Indenture limits the incurrence of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a
number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture does not impose any limitation on the incurrence by
Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock
under the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

166


-----

In addition, as described below under “—Certain Covenants—Future Guarantees” and subject to the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, each Restricted Subsidiary that guarantees the
Pension Guarantee Facility, the Super Senior Facilities, Public Debt or certain other indebtedness shall also enter
into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Notes.

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the
Pension Guarantee Facility, the Super Senior Facilities and the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include
restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general
statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference,
“thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and similar principles.

Each Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations
subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or
any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles
to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s
obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a
Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes
_and the Collateral—The Notes Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to certain_
_limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit_
_their validity and enforceability,” “—The Notes Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Notes will be subject_
_to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that_
_may limit their validity and enforceability” and “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the_
_Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

The Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and release as described under “Certain Covenants—Release of the
_Guarantees.”_

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Additional Notes will be issued in the form of several registered notes in global form without interest
coupons, as follows:

 - Additional Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under
the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without
interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”). The 144A Global Notes will, on or about the
Completion Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary
for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

 - Additional Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will
initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
“Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The
Regulation S Global Note will, on or about the Completion Date, be deposited with and registered in the
name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts
with Euroclear and Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants.

Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on
transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under the section “Offering
_and Transfer Restrictions” in the Offering Memorandum. In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between_
participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant to
customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream
and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) relating to the Additional
Notes may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S
Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests”) relating to the Additional Notes denominated in the same
currency only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to
the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of 144A BookEntry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the

167


-----

Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a
“qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of
Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under the section “Offering and
_Transfer Restrictions” in the Offering Memorandum and in accordance with any applicable securities law of any_
other jurisdiction.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a
Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it
will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000
principal amount, and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions
relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected
that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the
participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a
Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in
compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer
summarized below and described more fully under the section “Offering and Transfer Restrictions” in the
Offering Memorandum.

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be
transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 in principal amount and
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture
will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and
transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream,
where appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with such
transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any
Taxes payable in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Definitive
Registered Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control
Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will be entitled to treat the
Holder of a Note as the owner of it for all purposes.

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

As of the Issue Date, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for purposes of the
Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under “—Certain Definitions—Unrestricted
_Subsidiary,” the Issuer will be permitted to designate certain of its Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.”_
Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture.

**Security**

**_General_**

The Original Notes are, and upon the Temporary Notes Exchange, the Additional Notes will be, secured, subject
to the Agreed Security Principles, certain perfection requirements and any Permitted Collateral Liens, by security
interests granted on an equal and ratable first-priority basis over:

 - the issued Capital Stock of the Issuer (the “Issuer Share Pledge”);

 - the issued Capital Stock of the Initial Guarantors;

168


-----

 - certain long-term material intra-Group loans (in respect of which the Issuer or an Initial Guarantor is a
creditor), with a final maturity date or intended tenor in excess of 12 months and with a principal amount in
excess of €10 million (or its equivalent in other currencies) in aggregate to a member of the Group as debtor
(if any);

 - existing and future shareholder loans owed by the Issuer to the Parent, any Shareholder Creditor (as defined
in the Intercreditor Agreement) or any Sponsor Affiliate (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) (if any),
provided, however, that in respect of the pledge agreement entered into on or before the Original Issue Date
in respect of future shareholder loans, only the Parent entered into such pledge agreement and each
Shareholder Creditor and/or Sponsor Affiliate shall only enter into such pledge agreement prior to granting
any shareholder loans to the Issuer;

 - the Issuer’s and the Initial Guarantors’ material operating bank accounts (but excluding any escrow, cash
collateral, blocked and pooling accounts, accounts in connection with any receivables financing (including
discounting or factoring or similar), any guarantee or letter of credit financing, or similar) (if any); and

 - certain business mortgages (not resulting in stamp duties or similar) in the Initial Guarantors, (together, the
“Completion Date Collateral”).

Within 60 Business Days of the Completion Date, the Notes will be secured, subject to the Agreed Security
Principles, certain perfection requirements and any Permitted Collateral Liens, by Security Interests granted on
an equal and ratable first-priority basis over the issued Capital Stock of the Target (together with the Completion
Date Collateral, the “Collateral”).

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the Issuer and its Restricted_
Subsidiaries are permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with future issuances of
Indebtedness or Indebtedness of the Restricted Subsidiaries, including any Subsequent Additional Notes issued
by the Issuer as permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related
_to the Notes and the Collateral.”_

Any other security interests that may in the future be granted to secure obligations under the Notes, any
Guarantee and the Indenture would also constitute “Collateral.” All Collateral will be subject to the operation of
the Agreed Security Principles and any Permitted Collateral Liens.

Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of the covenant described below under “—Certain
_Covenants—Future Guarantees,” certain property, rights and assets may not be pledged, and any pledge over_
property, rights and assets may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed Security
Principles. Pursuant to the Agreed Security Principles, a guarantee or security may not be given, or may be
limited. The following is a non-exhaustive summary of certain terms of the Agreed Security Principles which
include, among others:

 - general legal and statutory limitations, financial assistance, capital maintenance, corporate benefit,
fraudulent preference, “interest stripping,” “controlled foreign corporation,” thin capitalization rules,
retention of title claims, employee consultation or approval requirements and similar principles may limit
the ability of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”) to provide a Guarantee or
security or may require that the Guarantee or security be limited by an amount or otherwise. If any such
limit applies, the Guarantees and security provided will be limited to the maximum amount which the
relevant member of the Group may provide having regard to applicable law (including any jurisprudence)
and subject to fiduciary duties of management;

 - the giving of a Guarantee, the granting and the terms of security or the perfection of the security granted will
not be required to the extent that the Group would incur any legal fees, registration fees, notary fees, stamp
duty, taxes and any other fees or costs directly associated with such security or Guarantee which are
disproportionate to the benefit obtained by the secured parties or having regard to the extent of the
obligations which can be guaranteed or secured by that security and the priority that will be offered by
taking or perfecting the security;

 - where there is material incremental cost involved in creating security over all assets owned by the Issuer or
any Guarantor in a particular category the principle stated in the previous bullet above shall apply and,
subject to the Agreed Security Principles, only the material assets in that category shall be subject to
security;

169


-----

- in certain jurisdictions, it may be either impossible, impractical or disproportionately costly to grant
Guarantees or create security over certain categories of assets in which event such Guarantees will not be
granted and security will not be taken over such assets;

- certain supervisory board, works council, regulator or regulatory board (or equivalent), or another external
body’s or person’s consent may be required to enable a member of the Group to provide a guarantee or
security. Such guarantee and/or security shall not be required unless such consent has been received
provided that reasonable endeavors have been used by the relevant member of the Group to obtain the
relevant consent (in each case if the security agent, taking into account the Issuer’s view on any potential
impact on relationships with third parties, reasonably requests the Issuer to do so);

- any assets subject to legal requirements, licenses or any other third-party arrangements (including, without
limitation, any trade receivables) which may prevent those assets from being charged (or assets which, if
charged, would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or
obligations of the Group in respect of those assets or require any member of the Group to take any action
materially adverse to the interests of the Group or any member thereof) will be excluded from any relevant
Security Document provided that, if the relevant asset is material and the Issuer determines (acting in good
faith) that such endeavors will not jeopardize commercial relationships with third parties, the relevant
member of the Group will use commercially reasonable endeavors to obtain any necessary consent or
waiver; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, no security shall be required over (and no consent or
waiver request submitted with respect to) assets which are required to support indebtedness assumed in
connection with an acquisition to the extent permitted by the terms of the Notes Documents to remain
outstanding following an acquisition (“Assumed Acquisition Indebtedness”) and no member of the target
group acquired pursuant to an acquisition where Assumed Acquisition Indebtedness remains outstanding
following completion of such permitted acquisition shall be required to become a Guarantor or grant
security with respect to the Notes Documents if prevented by the terms of the documentation governing
such Assumed Acquisition Indebtedness;

- members of the Group will not be required to give Guarantees or enter into Security Documents if it is not
within the legal capacity of the relevant members of the Group or if the same would conflict with the
fiduciary duties of those directors or contravene any legal prohibition, bona fide contractual restriction or
regulatory condition or result in (or in a material risk of) personal or criminal liability on the part of any
Officer or result in any significant risk of legal liability for the directors of any Group company, provided
that the relevant member of the Group shall use reasonable endeavors to overcome such obstacle;

- additional guarantee limitation provisions may be included in any supplemental indenture if required by any
Officer of any member of the Group in connection with the granting of a Guarantee in order to protect that
Officer from potential liability or other legal risk;

- the terms of the security should not be such that they materially restrict the running of the business of or
materially adversely affect the tax arrangements of the relevant member of the Group in the ordinary course
as otherwise permitted by the Notes Documents;

- perfection of security, when required, and other legal formalities will be completed as soon as practicable
and, in any event, within the time periods specified in the Notes Documents therefor or (if earlier or to the
extent no such time periods are specified in the Notes Documents) within the time periods specified by
applicable law in order to ensure due perfection. The giving of guarantee, the granting of security or the
perfection of security interests granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse effect on the
ability of the relevant Guarantor to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course as otherwise
permitted by the Notes Documents (and any requirement under the Agreed Security Principles to seek
consent of any person or take or not take any other action shall be subject to this paragraph);

- access to the assets of a Guarantor and the maximum guaranteed or secured amount may be restricted or
limited to minimize stamp duty, notarization, registration or other applicable fees, taxes and duties where
the benefit of increasing the Guarantee or secured amount is disproportionate to the level of such fees, taxes
and duties (and in any event the maximum aggregate amount payable by the Group in respect of fees, costs,
expenses, disbursements and VAT relating to the provision of guarantees and security shall be limited to an
amount to be agreed between the security agent and the Issuer);

- no perfection action will be required in jurisdictions where the Issuer or a Guarantor is not located;
provided, however, that perfection actions may be required in the jurisdiction of one Guarantor in relation to
security granted by another Guarantor in a different jurisdiction;

- guarantees and security will not be required from or over, or over the assets of, any joint venture or similar
arrangement or any minority interest;

170


-----

 - where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of granting security
over the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such security, security will be granted over
the material assets only;

 - any member of the Group which is not (directly or indirectly) a wholly owned Subsidiary of the Issuer (a
“Non-Wholly Owned Subsidiary”) shall not be required to become a Guarantor to the extent the Issuer is
unable to procure (after using its reasonable commercial endeavors) that any such person becomes a
Guarantor hereunder due to the opposition of the minority shareholders and financial assistance restrictions;

 - no security shall be required to be given to the extent to do so, in the case of a Non-Wholly Owned
Subsidiary, would breach any restriction contained in a shareholders’ agreement and all reasonable steps
have been taken to avoid or remove that restriction and in any event security shall only be granted, subject
to the other provisions of the Agreed Security Principles over the shares in a Non-Wholly Owned Subsidiary
which are owned by the relevant member of the Group;

 - no security (other than floating security) will be required to be taken over fixed assets, parts, stock,
moveable plant or equipment, trade receivables, intellectual property rights or real estate (other than where
such security may be granted under local law pursuant to a “floating charge” or all assets Security
Document without material cost to the relevant Guarantor), and no security will be required over hedging
agreements;

 - no security shall be required to be given over any escrow, cash collateral, blocked and pooling accounts,
accounts connected with any Bank Products, any receivables financing (including Qualified Receivables
Financing, discounting or factoring or similar), any guarantee or letter of credit financing, or similar), or any
accounts which are not material operating bank accounts;

 - no Guarantee or security shall Guarantee or secure any “Excluded Swap Obligations” defined in accordance
with the LSTA Market Advisory Update dated February 15, 2013 entitled “Swap Regulations’ Implications
for Loan Documentation,” and any update thereto by the LSTA;

 - no member of the Group will be required to create security over or otherwise encumber any Restricted Asset
(as defined below) (including, without limitation, any bank accounts which contain or are reasonably likely
to contain any Restricted Assets); and

 - no guarantees or security shall be required to be provided where to do so would be contrary to applicable
law or the provisions of the Agreed Security Principles. By virtue of the operation of the Agreed Security
Principles, guarantees and security may be given to, for the benefit of, or in respect of, certain secured
parties and certain liabilities which may not be given to, for the benefit of, or in respect of, other secured
parties and other liabilities (which may include the Notes).

For the purposes of the foregoing paragraph, “Restricted Asset” means:

 - the regulatory capital that a regulated entity is required to maintain pursuant to any applicable law or
regulation or the views, guidance or interpretation of any relevant regulator;

 - the settlement cash balances of that regulated entity and any other cash held by or on behalf of that regulated
entity for merchants, card schemes, cardholders of any card scheme, banks, financial institutions or other
similar entity or person;

 - any amounts held by or on behalf of that regulated entity in segregated funds under the Payment Services
Directive (PSD, 2007/64/EC) (or any relevant local implementing regulation or legislation) for merchants or
other payment service users or payment service providers or card schemes, cardholders of any card scheme,
banks, financial institutions or other similar entity or person;

 - any sums receivable by or on behalf of that regulated entity from or under any card scheme, bank, financial
institution or other similar entity or person for onward transmission or remittance to a merchant;

 - any sums receivable by or on behalf of that regulated entity from a merchant for onward transmission or
remittance to a card scheme bank, financial institution or other similar entity or person; and

 - any right, title or interest of that regulated entity in or under any letter of credit, guarantee, cash collateral or
other financial support or security provided by a bank, financial institution or other similar entity (or an
affiliate thereof) for its account to any card scheme counterparty.

As described above, all of the Collateral also secures or will secure, as applicable, the liabilities under the Super
Senior Facilities, as well as certain future Hedging Obligations and any Subsequent Additional Notes and may

171


-----

also secure certain future indebtedness; provided, however, that the lenders under the Super Senior Facilities and
counterparties to certain future Hedging Obligations, will receive the proceeds from the enforcement of the
Collateral in priority to the Holders of the Notes and any Subsequent Additional Notes. See “—Priority.” See
also, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Collateral—Creditors under the Super Senior Facilities,
_any credit facility that refinances or replaces the Super Senior Facilities, certain hedging obligations and certain_
_other indebtedness and obligations permitted to be incurred on a priority basis under the Indenture are entitled_
_to be repaid in priority to the Notes.”_

The lenders under the Super Senior Facilities and/or counterparties to certain future Hedging Obligations and any
Subsequent Additional Notes may also benefit from security which does not secure the Original Notes and the
Additional Notes offered hereby.

No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with this Offering of the Additional Notes (or in
respect of the offering of the Original Notes). By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may
have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short
period of time, or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Collateral—It may be difficult to
_realize the value of the Collateral securing the Additional Notes.”_

**_Priority_**

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the Security
Documents (the “Security Interests” and each a “Security Interest”) as between (a) the lenders under the Pension
Guarantee Facility (b) the lenders under the other Super Senior Facilities, (c) the counterparties under certain
future Hedging Obligations (if any) and (d) the Trustee, the Security Agent and the Holders of the Notes under
the Indenture, respectively, is established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture, the Security
Documents and the security documents relating to the Pension Guarantee Facility, the other Super Senior
Facilities and such Hedging Obligations (if any) which provide, among other things, that the obligations under
the Notes will receive proceeds on enforcement of security over the Collateral only after the claims of the
Pension Guarantee Facility, followed by the claims of the other Super Senior Facilities and such future Hedging
Obligations and any future Indebtedness permitted to be secured on a super-priority basis in accordance with the
terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, are satisfied.

See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” In addition, pursuant to the
Intercreditor Agreements or Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Original Issue Date, the
Collateral may be pledged or assigned to secure other Indebtedness. See “—Release of Liens,” “—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens.”_

**_Security Documents_**

Under the Security Documents, security has been or will be granted over the Collateral to secure, inter alia, the
payment when due of the Issuer’s payment obligations under the Notes and the Indenture. The Security
Documents have been or will be entered into among, inter alios, the relevant security provider and the Security
Agent as agent for the secured parties. Under the Security Documents, the Security Agent acts or will act in its
own name, but for the benefit of the secured parties (including itself, the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes
from time to time). Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent acts as an agent of the lenders under
the Super Senior Facilities and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations in relation to the Security
Interests created in favor of such parties.

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement provide that, to the extent permitted by the applicable laws, only
the Security Agent will have the right to enforce the Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee and the
Holders of the Notes. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, Holders of the Notes will not be entitled
to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Security Agent
under the Indenture. To the extent permitted by the applicable laws and subject to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Indenture, Holders of the Notes will, in certain circumstances, be entitled to direct the Trustee
to provide instructions to the Security Agent for the enforcement of security over the Collateral. Under the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will also act on behalf of the lenders under the Super Senior
Facilities and the counterparties under certain hedging agreements in relation to the Security Interests in favor of
such parties.

The Indenture provides that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes and the
Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by Security Interests in the Collateral until all obligations under the

172


-----

Notes and the Indenture have been discharged. However, the Security Interests may be released under certain
circumstances as provided under “—Release of Liens” below. Please see the section of the Offering
Memorandum entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Collateral.” The validity and
enforceability of the Security Interests will be subject to, inter alia, the limitations described in “Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to the Notes and the Collateral” and “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the_
_Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

The Security Documents provide or will provide that the rights under the Security Documents and the Indenture
must be exercised by the Security Agent. The Holders may only act through the Trustee, who will instruct the
Security Agent in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.

In the event that the Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the
Security Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in the
Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the Security
Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement was successful, the Holders may not be able to recover any
amounts under the Security Documents. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Collateral.”

**_Enforcement of Security Interest_**

The Security Documents provide that the rights under the Security Documents must be exercised by the Security
Agent. Since the Holders are not a party to the Security Documents, Holders may not, individually or
collectively, take any direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Security Documents. The
Holders may only act through the Security Agent or the Trustee (as applicable).

To the extent permitted by the applicable laws and subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the
Indenture, Holders of the Notes will, in certain circumstances, be entitled to direct the Trustee to provide
instructions to the Security Agent for the enforcement of security over the Collateral. The Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement will restrict the ability of the Holders or the Trustee to enforce the Security Interests and
provide for the release of the Security Interests created by the Security Documents in certain circumstances upon
enforcement by the lenders under the Super Senior Facilities. These limitations are described under “Description
_of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Certain Insolvency Considerations and_
_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests.” The ability to_
enforce may also be restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness that is secured on the
Collateral in compliance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The creditors under the Super Senior Facilities, the counterparties to certain Hedging Obligations (if any) secured
by the Collateral and the Trustee have, and by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to have, appointed
the Security Agent to act as its agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents securing such
Indebtedness, including the Security Documents. The creditors under the Super Senior Facilities, the
counterparties to certain Hedging Obligations (if any) secured by the Collateral and the Trustee have, and by
accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to have, authorized the Security Agent to: (i) perform the duties
and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement
and the security documents securing such Indebtedness, including the Security Documents, together with any
other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each Security Document, waiver, modification,
amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Security Agent on its behalf.

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_**

The Indenture provides that the Issuer and the Trustee will be authorized (without any further consent of the
Holders of the Notes) to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement to give effect to the provisions described in the
section entitled “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

The Indenture also provides that each Holder of the Notes, by accepting such Note, will be deemed to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements;

(2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents;

(3) agreed and acknowledged that the Security Agent will administer the Collateral in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture and the Security Documents; and

173


-----

(4) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into and comply with
the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

Please see the sections entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Collateral—Holders of the
_Original Notes and the Additional Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral” and_
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as
defined below) entered into in compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional
_Intercreditor Agreements.”_

**_Release of Liens_**

The Issuer and its Subsidiaries and any provider of Collateral will be entitled to the release of the Security
Interests in respect of the Collateral under any one or more of the following circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral to (a) any Person other than the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to “—Certain Covenants—Merger and
_Consolidation”), if such sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under “—Certain_
_Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” or is otherwise permitted in accordance_
with the Indenture or (b) any Restricted Subsidiary, provided that this clause (b) shall not be relied upon in
the case of a transfer of capital stock or of accounts receivable to a Restricted Subsidiary (except to a
Receivables Subsidiary) unless the relevant property and assets remain subject to, or otherwise become
subject to a Lien in favor of the Notes following such sale or disposal;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the
release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

(3) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(4) [Reserved];

(5) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or defeasance or discharge
of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(6) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock of such
Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(7) in accordance with an enforcement action pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

(8) pursuant to a Permitted Reorganization or in the case of a merger, consolidation or other transfer of assets in
compliance with the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”;

(9) in contemplation of an Initial Public Offering in respect of the Issuer, the irrevocable and unconditional
release (an “IPO Release”), at the option of the Issuer of the Issuer Share Pledge, provided that, (i) the
Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio is not, at such time, greater than 3.00 to 1.0 (calculated on a pro forma
basis after giving effect to such Initial Public Offering and the receipt and use of proceeds therefrom) and
(ii) in the event security is released pursuant to an IPO Release in contemplation of an Initial Public
Offering which is then cancelled or revoked or does not complete for any reason, to the extent permitted by
law and subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Issuer shall, or shall procure that the relevant Parent
shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, execute a replacement Security Document in favor of the Notes in
respect of that security so released;

(10) in the case of any security interests over intra-group receivables (if any), upon partial repayment or
discharge thereof, the security interests created over such receivables will be automatically reduced in
proportion to such partial repayment or discharge and, upon full repayment or discharge thereof, the security
interests shall be automatically and fully released and of no further effect; or

(11) as may be permitted by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security
_Interest.”_

At the request of the Issuer, the Security Agent and the Trustee (if required) will take all necessary action
required to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees, in accordance with the

174


-----

provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the
relevant Security Document. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without
the consent of the Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee (unless action is required by it to effect such
release).

Notwithstanding any other provisions, the release of any perfected Liens over any Collateral under security
documents governed by Swedish law or disposal of (including, without limitation, any conversion, set-off or
forgiveness of indebtedness, payment or by way of merger of shares or assets which are subject to perfected
Liens) or transfer of any assets, property and/or interests subject to such perfected Liens, in each case, to the
extent such Lien is governed by Swedish law, will be subject to the prior written consent of the Security Agent
unless the assets to be released are disposed of for the full market value and the proceeds are directly paid to the
Security Agent and applied towards repayment and/or prepayment of any debt secured by the relevant Liens (or
are paid into a blocked account which is subject to perfected Liens and held with the Security Agent). The
Security Agent’s consent shall be given on a case by case basis and in its sole discretion. Each Holder of the
Notes irrevocably authorizes the Security Agent to release such Liens without notification or further reference to
the Holders of the Notes.

**Optional Redemption**

On and after December 1, 2020, the Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, part of the Notes upon not less
than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at the following redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of principal
amount) plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts (as defined below), if any, to, but not
including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to

or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in
the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the
redemption date so delayed, provided that in no case shall the notice have been delivered less than 10 days or
more than 60 days prior to the date on which such redemption (if any) occurs. In addition, the Issuer may provide
in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to
such redemption may be performed by another Person. In no event shall the Trustee be responsible for
monitoring, or charged with knowledge of, the maximum aggregate amount of the Notes eligible under the
Indenture to be redeemed.

_General_

redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice” below.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment
date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at the close
of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject
to redemption by the Issuer.

In connection with any redemption of Notes, any such redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to
one or more conditions precedent.

**Sinking Fund**

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the
Notes.

applicable Notes on the date such tender offer commences (as determined in good faith by the Issuer), plus
accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding the applicable tender settlement date, if Holders of Notes of
not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable outstanding Notes validly tendered and do not
withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of
the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such
third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30
days following such tender offer expiration date, to redeem the Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in
part, following such purchase, at a price equal to the price offered to each other Holder of Notes in such tender
offer, plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to,
but excluding such redemption date.

**Redemption at Maturity**

On May 15, 2025 the Issuer will redeem the Notes that have not been previously redeemed or purchased and
cancelled at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if
any, to the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of any series of Notes is to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or the Registrar will select
Notes for redemption in compliance with the requirements of the principal securities exchange, if any, on which
the Notes are listed, and in compliance with the requirements of Euroclear or Clearstream, or if the Notes are not
so listed or such exchange prescribes no method of selection and the Notes are not held through Euroclear or
Clearstream, or Euroclear or Clearstream prescribes no method of selection, on a pro rata basis by use of a pool
factor; provided, however, that no Note of €100,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in
part and only Notes in integral multiples of €1,000 will be redeemed. Neither the Trustee, the Paying Agent nor
the Registrar will be liable for any selections made in accordance with this paragraph.

If and so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange and to the extent
that the rules and regulations of The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”) so
require, the Issuer shall notify the Authority of such redemption and, in addition to such publication, not less than
10 days nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption, the Issuer will mail, or at the expense of the Issuer, cause
to be mailed, such notice to Holders. All notices to Holders will be validly given if mailed to them at their
respective addresses in the register of Holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar. For Notes which are
represented by global certificates held on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, notices may be given by delivery of
the relevant notices to Euroclear or Clearstream in substitution for the aforesaid mailing to Holders.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the portion
of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive
Registered Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of any Definitive Registered Note
redeemed in part will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Definitive
Registered Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Note to decrease the
principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the
applicable redemption notice, Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and
after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of Notes called for redemption.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor more
than 60 days’ prior notice to the Holders of the Notes (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price
equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed
for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date
to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts (as defined below under
“—Withholding Taxes”), if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of
the redemption or otherwise, if any, if the Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder)
of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

176


-----

(2) any amendment to, or change in an official written position regarding the application, administration or
interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a court
of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) (each of the foregoing in clauses
(1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Notes would be, required to
pay Additional Amounts with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the
payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or another Guarantor who can make such
payment without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts) and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking
reasonable measures available to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new
Paying Agent where this would be reasonable). Such Change in Tax Law must be announced and become
effective on or after the Original Notes Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Tax Jurisdiction became a
Relevant Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the Original Notes Issue Date, such later date). The foregoing provisions
shall apply mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the
Indenture, with respect to a change or amendments occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a
party to the Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under
“—Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given: (a) earlier
than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of
Additional Amounts; and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional
Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant
to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee: (i) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to
effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so
to redeem have been satisfied; and (ii) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing and
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) to the effect that the
relevant Payor has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law.
The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion of tax counsel as
sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in
which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (each, a “Payor”) in respect of the Notes or
with respect to any Guarantee, as applicable, will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction
for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any
deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) Sweden or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or therein having power to tax;

(2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or any Guarantee is made by or on behalf
of the Payor, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to
tax; or

(3) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated, organized, engaged in business for tax purposes, or
otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental
authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1), (2) and (3) a “Relevant Taxing
_Jurisdiction”),_

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor or the
Paying Agent under or with respect to any Note or any Guarantee, including, without limitation, payments of
principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such
additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in
respect of such payments, after such withholding or deduction (including any such deduction or withholding
from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been received in respect of
such payments on any such Note or Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided,
_however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:_

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection
between the relevant Holder or the beneficial owner of a Note (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary,
partner, member or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder or beneficial owner, if
the relevant Holder or beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or

177


-----

corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being resident for tax
purposes, or being a citizen or resident, national or domiciliary of, or carrying on a business for tax
purposes, or maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership,
holding or sale of such Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under
such Note, the Indenture or a Guarantee;

(2) any Tax that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner of the
Note to comply with a written request of the Payor or any other person through whom payment can be made
addressed to the Holder, after reasonable notice by the Payor (at least 60 days before any such withholding
or deduction would be payable), to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence
concerning the nationality, residence or identity or connection with the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction of the
Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting
requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative
practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part of such Tax but,
only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or
documentation;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of the Note for
payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made
available for payment to the Holder;

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment of the principal of,
premium, if any, or interest, if any, on the Notes or with respect to any Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other
governmental charge;

(6) any Taxes imposed in connection with a Note presented for payment by or on behalf of a Holder or
beneficial owner who would have been able to avoid such Tax by presenting the relevant Note to, or
otherwise accepting payment from, another Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union; or

(7) any combination of the items (1) through (6) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or
any person other than the beneficial owner of the Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settler with respect
to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to
Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner held such Notes directly.

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture, any amounts to be paid on the Notes by or on behalf of the
Issuer will be paid net of any deduction or withholding imposed or required pursuant to an agreement described
in Section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or otherwise imposed
pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (or any regulations thereunder or official interpretations
thereof) or an intergovernmental agreement between the United States and another jurisdiction facilitating the
implementation thereof (or any fiscal or regulatory legislation, rules or practices implementing such an
intergovernmental agreement) (any such withholding or deduction, a “FATCA Withholding”). Neither the Issuer
nor any other person will be required to pay any additional amounts in respect of FATCA Withholding.

The Payor will (i) make or cause to be made any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount
deducted or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use
all reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted
or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes or, if such tax receipts are not
reasonably available, other reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the
Trustee and copied to the Paying Agent. Such copies or other evidence shall be made available to the Holders
upon request and will be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any Note or
any Guarantee, at least 45 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the
Paying Agent, an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount
estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional
Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less
than 30 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as
promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are
necessary.

178


-----

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a redemption of Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context,
Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay and indemnify the Holder or beneficial owner for any present or future stamp, issue,
registration, transfer, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest,
penalties or additions to tax) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including
any related interest, penalties or additions to tax) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution,
delivery, or registration of any Notes, any Guarantee, the Indenture, or any other document or instrument in
relation thereto (other than in each case, in connection with a transfer of the Additional Notes after this Offering)
or the receipt of any payments with respect thereto or any such taxes or charges or levies (including any related
interest, penalties, or additions to tax) imposed by any jurisdiction as a result of, or in connection with, the
enforcement of the Notes any Guarantee (limited, solely in the case of the receipt of any payments with respect
thereto, to taxes or similar charges or levies imposed in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction that are not excluded
under clauses (1) through (3) above or clauses (5) through (7) above or any combination thereof).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and any transfer
by a Holder or beneficial owner of its Notes, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any
successor to a Payor is incorporated, organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax
purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to the Notes is made by
or on behalf of such Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms of the covenant described under this heading “—Change of
_Control,” each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part of such Holder’s_
Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid
interest to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be obligated to
repurchase the Notes as described under this heading, “—Change of Control,” in the event and to the extent that
it has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of the Notes of such series as described under “—Optional
_Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived._

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes as described under “—Optional
_Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is_
60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will mail a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder
of Notes, with a copy to the Trustee:

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require the
Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the
principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of purchase
(subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment
date) (the “Change of Control Payment”);

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such
notice is mailed) and the record date (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) stating that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue
interest on the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Payment is not paid, and that
any Notes or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest;

(4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute the
Change of Control;

(5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must follow
in order to have its Notes repurchased; and

179


-----

(6) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control
Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the
extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes so
tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount
of Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer;

(4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent the Global Notes in order
to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by
the Issuer; and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Registrar for cancellation
all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer.

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of
Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee (or an
authenticating agent) will, at the cost of the Issuer, promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by
book-entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal
amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any, provided that each such new Note will be in
a principal amount that is at least €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

If and so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange and to the extent
that the rules and regulations of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any Change of
Control Offer.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that
permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover,
recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase such
Holder’s Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the
Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party
makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases
all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control,
conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place providing
for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. The closing date of any such Change
of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control may be changed to conform to the actual closing date
of the Change of Control, provided that such closing date is not earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from
the date the Change of Control Offer notice is mailed as described in the second paragraph of this section.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and
any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To
the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the
Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached
its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of the conflict.

If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not
withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third-party making a Change of Control
Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by
such Holders, the Issuer or such third-party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’
prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer
described above, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to
101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but
excluding the date of redemption.

180


-----

The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a
number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control may require a
mandatory prepayment of certain Indebtedness. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control
under certain Indebtedness and may require a mandatory prepayment of such Indebtedness may not constitute a
Change of Control under the Indenture. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain
prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be
repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer
to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the
Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the
Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing
financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any
required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Collateral—We may not be able to
_obtain the funds required to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control and the occurrence of certain_
_important corporate events will not constitute a Change of Control.”_

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets
of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a
limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of
the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree
of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the
property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and
whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a
result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in
outstanding principal amount of the Notes.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness (including
Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary may Incur
Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) if on the date of such Incurrence and after giving pro forma
effect thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof):

(1) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been at least 2.0
to 1.0; and

(2) to the extent that the Indebtedness is Senior Secured Indebtedness, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net
Leverage Ratio for the Issuer’s most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial
statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred
would have been no greater than 4.3 to 1.0.

Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not Guarantors may only incur Indebtedness pursuant to this first
paragraph if the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Indebtedness incurred by Restricted Subsidiaries of
the Issuer that are not Guarantors pursuant to this first paragraph (calculated at the time of such incurrence and
after giving effect to the incurrence of such Indebtedness and the application of proceeds thereof, on a pro forma
basis) would not exceed an amount equal to the greater of €16.0 million and 25% of Consolidated EBITDA.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness (“Permitted
_Debt”):_

(1) Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility (including in respect of letters of credit or bankers’
acceptances issued or created thereunder), and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and
Guarantees in respect of such Indebtedness in a maximum aggregate principal amount at any time
outstanding not exceeding (a) the greater of (i) SEK 550 million and (ii) 80% of Consolidated EBITDA plus
(b) the amount of any Guarantee Facilities, plus in the case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted
under this clause (1) or any portion thereof, the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums
and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing;

(2)

(a) Guarantees by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary, so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted under the terms of the
Indenture; or

181


-----

(b) without limiting the covenant described under “—Limitation on Liens,” Indebtedness arising by reason
of any Lien granted by or applicable to any Person securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted under the terms of the
Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Issuer owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a Restricted
Subsidiary owing to and held by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that:

(a) in the case of Indebtedness owing by the Issuer to any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor
(except in respect of intercompany liabilities Incurred in the ordinary course of business or in
connection with cash pooling or cash management or tax positions of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries), such Indebtedness shall be (subject to the Agreed Security Principles and the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement) unsecured and expressly subordinated in right of payment to the prior
payment in full in cash of all obligations with respect to the Notes, in the case of the Issuer, and the
respective Guarantee, in the case of a Guarantor, in each case pursuant to and to the extent required by
the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(b) (i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in any such
Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the
Issuer; and (ii) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person other than the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer, shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such
Indebtedness not permitted by this clause (3) by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case
may be;

(4) (a) Indebtedness represented by the Original Notes outstanding on the Original Notes Issue Date, the related
Guarantees, and any related “parallel debt” obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security
Documents, (b) any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness Incurred under the Super Senior Facilities and
Indebtedness described in clause (3) of this paragraph) outstanding on the Original Notes Issue Date,
(c) Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness described in this clause (4) or clauses
(5) and (13) of this paragraph or Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and
(d) Management Advances;

(5) Indebtedness of any Person (a) outstanding on the date on which such Person becomes a Restricted
Subsidiary or any Restricted Subsidiary or is merged, consolidated, amalgamated or otherwise combined
with (including pursuant to any acquisition of assets and assumption of related liabilities) the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary or (b) Incurred to provide all or a portion of the funds utilized to consummate the
transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which any Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or
was otherwise acquired by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, with respect to this
clause (5), that at the time of such acquisition or other transaction (x) the Issuer would have been able to
Incur €1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio in the first paragraph of
this covenant after giving pro forma effect to the relevant acquisition and the Incurrence of such
Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (5) or (y) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would not be less than it
was immediately prior to giving effect to such acquisition or other transaction;

(6) Indebtedness under Currency Agreements, Interest Rate Agreements and Commodity Hedging Agreements
not for speculative purposes (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the
Issuer);

(7) Indebtedness consisting of (a) Capitalized Lease Obligations, mortgage financings, Purchase Money
Obligations or other financings, incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price or
cost of construction or improvement of property, plant or equipment used in a Similar Business or
(b) Indebtedness otherwise incurred to finance the purchase, lease, rental or cost of design, construction,
installation or improvement of property (real or personal) or equipment that is used or useful in a Similar
Business, whether through the direct purchase of assets or the Capital Stock of any Person owning such
assets, and any Indebtedness which refinances, replaces or refunds such Indebtedness, in an aggregate
outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with the principal amount of all other
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (7) and then outstanding, will not exceed at any time
outstanding the greater of €40.0 million and 66% of Consolidated EBITDA;

(8) Indebtedness in respect of (a) workers’ compensation claims, self-insurance obligations, performance,
indemnity, surety, judgment, appeal, advance payment, customs, VAT or other tax or other guarantees or
other similar bonds, instruments or obligations and completion guarantees and warranties provided by the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or relating to liabilities, obligations or guarantees Incurred in the ordinary
course of business or in respect of any governmental requirement, (b) letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances,

hereunder (including, without limitation, by way of set-off or exchange), so long as any such Indebtedness is
repaid within 5 Business Days of the date on which such Indebtedness is incurred.

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in
the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from
time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type of
such Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant;

(2) all Indebtedness outstanding on the Original Notes Issue Date under the Super Senior Facilities shall be
deemed initially Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant and not the first
paragraph or clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of this covenant, and may not be reclassified;

(3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments
relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular
amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred
pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (7), (11), (15) or
(16) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’
acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not
be included;

(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of
a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase
price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference
thereof;

(6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision
permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more
other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(7) for the purposes of determining “Consolidated EBITDA” (x) pro forma effect shall be given to Consolidated
EBITDA on the same basis for calculating the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio for the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries and (y) in relation to clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant,
Consolidated EBITDA shall be measured on the most recent date on which new commitments are obtained
(in the case of revolving facilities) or the date on which new Indebtedness is Incurred (in the case of term
facilities) and for the period of the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters ending prior to such date for
which such internal consolidated financial statements of the Issuer are available; and

(8) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to
the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original
issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the
form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or
obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of
Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” Except as
otherwise specified, the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value
thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (b) the principal amount, or

184


-----

liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness. For purposes of determining compliance
with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness Incurred under a Credit Facility, reborrowings of amounts
previously repaid pursuant to “cash sweep” provisions or any similar provisions under a Credit Facility that
provide that Indebtedness is deemed to be repaid daily (or otherwise periodically), including any revolving
indebtedness, shall only be deemed for purposes of this covenant to have been Incurred on the date such
Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on the date of any subsequent reborrowing thereof.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary
shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not
permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the
Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall
be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred,
in the case of term Indebtedness, or, at the option of the Issuer, first committed, in the case of Indebtedness
Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that; (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other
Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable eurodenominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date
of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded, so long as the
principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the
definition of Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness
outstanding on the Original Notes Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in
effect on the Original Notes Issue Date; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different
currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to the euro) covering principal amounts payable on
such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in euro will be adjusted to take into account the
effect of such agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result
of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to
refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be
calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing
Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor will incur any Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt) that is contractually
subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor unless such
Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and the applicable Guarantee, if
any, on substantially identical terms; provided, however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually
subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of
being unsecured or by virtue of being secured with different collateral or by virtue of being secured on a junior
priority basis or by virtue of the application of waterfall or other payment ordering provisions affecting different
tranches of Indebtedness. No Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to
any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being
secured on a first or junior Lien basis.

for value of Subordinated Shareholder Funding (or similar obligations) or Capital Stock of the Issuer or any
Parent (other than Disqualified Stock), or any obligation under a forward sale agreement, deferred purchase
agreement or deferred payment arrangement pursuant to any management equity plan or stock option plan
or any other management or employee benefit or incentive plan or other agreement or arrangement or

189


-----

(b) any management equity plan or stock option plan or any other management or employee benefit or
incentive plan or unit trust or the trustees of any such plan or trust to pay for the purchase or other
acquisition for value of Subordinated Shareholder Funding (or similar obligations) or Capital Stock of the
Issuer or any Parent (other than Disqualified Stock); provided that the total aggregate amount of Restricted
Payments made under this clause (19) does not exceed €2.0 million in any calendar year; and

(20) dividends, loans, advances, payments or other distributions in amounts required for a direct or indirect
parent of the Issuer to pay interest, premium, catch-up payments, make-whole amounts and break costs in
respect of Indebtedness, the net cash proceeds of which have been contributed to the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries and that has been guaranteed by, or is otherwise considered Indebtedness of, the
Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries incurred in accordance with the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of such
Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value of any
cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash Restricted Payment
shall be determined conclusively by an Officer or the Board of Directors of the Issuer acting in good faith.

For the purposes of calculating “Consolidated EBITDA” pro forma effect shall be given to Consolidated
EBITDA on the same basis as for calculating the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio for the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries.

If any Investment or Restricted Payment would be permitted pursuant to one or more provisions described above
and/or one or more of the exceptions contained in the definition of “Permitted Payment” or “Permitted
Investment” (or any other definition used in this covenant or such definitions), the Issuer may, at its sole
discretion, divide and classify such Investment or Restricted Payment in any manner that complies with this
covenant or such definition and may later reclassify in whole or in part any such Investment or Restricted
Payment (based on circumstances existing on the date of such reclassification) in whole or in part at any time, so
long as the Investment or Restricted Payment (as so reclassified) would be permitted to be made in reliance on
the applicable exception as of the date of such reclassification.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or suffer
to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary of the
Issuer), whether owned on the Original Notes Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any
income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien the “Initial Lien”), except (a) in
the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral, (1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property
or assets that are not Permitted Liens if the Notes and the Indenture (or a Guarantee of the Notes in the case of
Liens of a Guarantor) are (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) directly secured equally and ratably with, or
prior to, in the case of Liens with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial
Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is so secured, and (b), in the case of any property or asset that constitutes
Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Notes will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged
upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates, and (ii) otherwise as set forth under
“—Security—Release of Liens.”

For the purposes of determining compliance with this covenant and for the purposes of the definitions of
Permitted Lien (other than in respect of clause (29) of the definition thereof) and Permitted Collateral Lien, in the
event that a Lien meets the criteria of more than one of the categories or exceptions contained in the definition of,
as the case may be, “Permitted Lien” or “Permitted Collateral Lien” (or any other definition used in this covenant
or such definitions), as applicable, the Issuer may, at its sole discretion, divide and classify such Lien in any
manner that complies with this covenant or such definition and may later divide and/or reclassify any such Lien
at any time and in any manner that complies with this covenant or such definition.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit to exist
or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted
Subsidiary to:

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock to the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary or pay any Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to_
dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the
application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to
other Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such an
encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) the Indenture, the Notes, any Credit Facility (including the
Super Senior Facilities), the Security Documents, any Guarantee and any Intercreditor Agreement and
Additional Intercreditor Agreement or (b) any other agreement or instrument with respect to the Issuer and
its Subsidiaries, in each case, in effect at or entered into on the Original Notes Issue Date (including the
Indenture, the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents or any related security
documents); and (in all cases) any amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements,
refundings, replacements or refinancings of any such agreements or arrangements referred to in this
clause (1) provided that such encumbrances and restrictions are not materially more restrictive, taken as a
whole, with respect to dividend and other payment restrictions than those contained in those agreements as
at the Original Notes Issue Date (as determined in good faith by the Issuer);

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating to any Capital
Stock or Indebtedness of a Person entered into on or before the date on which such Person was acquired by
or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, or on
which such agreement or instrument is assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection
with an acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, or to
provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of related
transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Issuer or
was merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
entered into or in connection with such transaction) and outstanding on such date; provided that, for the
purposes of this clause (2), if another Person is the Successor Issuer (as defined under “—Merger and
_Consolidation”), any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary_
shall be deemed acquired or assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes
the Successor Issuer;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a refinancing of
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument referred to in
clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3) (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in any
amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this
paragraph or this clause (3); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to such
Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less favorable in any material
respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial
Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other
modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer);

(4) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or asset that
is subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment or transfer of any lease, license or
other contract;

(b) contained in mortgages, charges, pledges or other security agreements permitted under the Indenture or
securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted under the Indenture to the
extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict the transfer of the property or assets subject to such
mortgages, charges, pledges or other security agreements; or

191


-----

(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in any
reciprocal easement agreements of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capitalized Lease Obligations
permitted under the Indenture, in each case, that impose encumbrances or restrictions on the property so
acquired, or any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to a joint venture agreement that imposes restrictions
on the distribution or transfer of the assets or Capital Stock of the joint venture;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any of its property or assets)
imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect sale or disposition to a Person of all,
or substantially all, the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary (or the property or assets that
are subject to such restriction) pending the closing of such sale or disposition;

(7) customary provisions in leases, licenses, joint venture agreements and other similar agreements and
instruments entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(8) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable rule,
regulation or order, or required by any regulatory authority;

(9) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers under
agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(10) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Currency Agreements, Interest Rate Agreements or Commodity
Hedging Agreements;

(11) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument (a) relating to any
Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Original Notes Issue Date pursuant to the
provisions of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if the encumbrances and
restrictions contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable
to the Holders of the Notes than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Indenture or the
Super Senior Facilities, together with the security documents associated therewith, or the Intercreditor
Agreement, in each case, as in effect on the Original Notes Issue Date or (ii) as is customary in comparable
financings (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer) or where the
Issuer determines that such encumbrance or restriction will not adversely affect in any material respect the
Issuer’s ability to make principal or interest payments on the Notes or (b) constituting an Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

(12) restrictions effected in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing that, in the good faith
determination of the Board of Directors or, an Officer or of the Issuer, are necessary or advisable to effect
such Qualified Receivables Financing; or

(13) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any lien permitted under “—Limitation on Liens.”

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any Asset Disposition unless:

(1) the consideration the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives (including by way of relief from, or by
any Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) for such Asset Disposition
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap) is not less than
the fair market value of the assets sold (as determined by the Issuer’s Board of Directors); and

(2) except where the Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75% of the consideration the Issuer
or such Restricted Subsidiary receives in respect of such Asset Disposition or series of related Asset
Dispositions consists of:

(i) cash (including any Net Cash Proceeds received from the conversion within 180 days of such Asset
Disposition of securities, notes or other obligations received in consideration of such Asset
Disposition);

(ii) Cash Equivalents;

(iii) the assumption by the purchaser of (x) any liabilities recorded on the Issuer’s or such Restricted
Subsidiary’s consolidated balance sheet or the notes thereto (or, if Incurred since the date of the latest
balance sheet, that would be recorded on the next balance sheet) (other than Subordinated
Indebtedness), as a result of which neither the Issuer, nor any of the Restricted Subsidiaries remains
obligated in respect of such liabilities or (y) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a
Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, if the Issuer and each other Restricted
Subsidiary is released from any guarantee of such Indebtedness as a result of such Asset Disposition;

192


-----

(iv) Replacement Assets;

(v) any Capital Stock or assets of the kind referred to in clause (D) or (F) in the second paragraph of this
covenant;

(vi) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor received from Persons who are
not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, but only to the extent that such Indebtedness (i) has been
extinguished by the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor and (ii) is not Subordinated Indebtedness of the
Issuer or such Guarantor;

(vii) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, having an
aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received
pursuant to this covenant that is at any one time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of €19.0 million
and 30% of Consolidated EBITDA (with the fair market value of each issue of Designated Non-Cash
Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in
value); or

(viii) a combination of the consideration specified in clauses (i) through (vii) of this clause (2).

If the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Disposition, the Net Cash Proceeds of the Asset
Disposition received by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, within 365 days (or 545 days in the circumstances
described in clause (H) below) of the later of (i) the date of completion of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the
receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds, may be used by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary to:

(A) (i) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of
the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect
thereof, (ii) unless included in (A)(i), prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Notes or Indebtedness that is
secured by a Lien on the Collateral and that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes,
(iii) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Indebtedness that is not subordinated in right of payment to the
Notes that is secured on assets which do not constitute Collateral, or (iv) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem
any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor (in each case other than Subordinated
Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor or Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary);
_provided that the Issuer shall prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Public Debt (other than the Notes) pursuant_
to clause (ii) only if the Issuer either (1) reduces the aggregate principal amount of the Notes on an equal
and ratable basis with any such Indebtedness by purchasing Notes through open-market purchases or in
privately negotiated transactions at market prices or (2) makes (at such time or in compliance with this
covenant) an offer to Holders to purchase their Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth below for
an Asset Disposition Offer for an aggregate principal amount of Notes equal to the proportion that (x) the
total aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding bears to (y) the sum total aggregate principal amount
of the Notes outstanding plus the total aggregate principal amount outstanding of such Indebtedness (other
than the Notes);

(B) purchase any series of Notes pursuant to an offer to all Holders of such Notes at a purchase price in cash
equal to at least 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of relevant record
on the record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date);

(C) invest in any Replacement Assets;

(D) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Similar Business, if, after
giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Similar Business is or becomes a Restricted
Subsidiary;

(E) make a capital expenditure;

(F) acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock and cash or Cash Equivalents) that are used or useful in a
Similar Business;

(G) consummate any combination of the foregoing; or

(H) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Cash Proceeds pursuant to clause (A), (C), (D), (E) or
(F) of this paragraph or a combination thereof,

_provided that, a binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Cash Proceeds_
from the date of such commitment until the earlier of (x) the date on which such investment is consummated
and (y) the 180th day following the expiration of the aforementioned 365 day period, if the investment has
not been consummated by that date.

193


-----

The amount of such Net Cash Proceeds not so used as set forth in this paragraph constitutes “Excess Proceeds.”
Pending the final application of any such Net Cash Proceeds, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may
temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or other Indebtedness or otherwise invest such Net Cash
Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture.

On the 366th day (or the 546th day if a binding commitment as described in clause (H) is entered into) after an
Asset Disposition, or such earlier time if the Issuer elects, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds
€20.0 million, the Issuer will be required within 10 Business Days thereof to make an offer (“Asset Disposition
_Offer”) to all Holders and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu_
Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to
which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in
respect of the Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no
more than) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and 100% of the principal amount of Pari Passu
Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase, in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing the Pari Passu
Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in
excess thereof in the case of the Notes.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use
any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to other covenants contained in the
Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders
and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess
Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be repaid or
purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in
euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amounts into their Euro Equivalent
determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined
below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a currency
other than the currency in which the relevant Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of
such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Notes are denominated that is
actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net Available Cash into such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of not less than
20 Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later than five
Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset Disposition Purchase
_Date”), the Issuer will purchase the principal amount of Notes and, to the extent it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness_
required to be repaid or purchased by it pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if
less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness
validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment, on a
pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness
or portions of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the
Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and in
minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will
deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof were accepted for
payment by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of this covenant. The Issuer or the Paying Agent, as the case
may be, will promptly (but, in any case, not later than five Business Days after termination of the Asset
Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase price of the
Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Issuer for purchase,
and the Issuer will promptly issue a new Note (or amend the applicable Global Note), and the Trustee (or an
authenticating agent), upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, will authenticate and mail or
deliver (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) such new Note to such Holder, in a principal amount equal to
any unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount
with a minimum denomination of €100,000. Any Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or
transferred by book-entry) by the Issuer to the Holder thereof.

194


-----

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and
any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to the Indenture. To
the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the
Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached
its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into or
conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any
property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer (any such transaction or series of related
transactions being an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of €2.0 million unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable
transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such transaction
in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate;

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of €10.0 million, the terms of
such transaction or series of related transactions have been approved by a resolution of the majority of the
disinterested members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer resolving that such transaction complies with
clause (1) above; and

(3) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate consideration in excess of €25.0 million, the
Issuer has received a written opinion (a “Fairness Opinion”) from an Independent Financial Advisor that
such Affiliate Transaction is fair, from a financial standpoint, to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries or
that the terms are not materially less favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained in a
comparable transaction at such time on an arm’s length basis from a Person that is not an Affiliate.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments,” any Permitted Payments (other than pursuant to clause (9)(b)(ii) of the third_
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”) or any Permitted
Investment (other than Permitted Investments as defined in paragraphs (1)(b) and (2) of the definition
thereof);

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, or other
payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or entering into, or
maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other compensation arrangements, options,
warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent,
restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation rights plans, participation plans or
similar employee benefits or consultants’ plans (including valuation, health, insurance, deferred
compensation, severance, retirement, savings or similar plans, programs or arrangements) or indemnities
provided on behalf of officers, employees, directors or consultants approved by the Board of Directors of
the Issuer, in each case in the ordinary course of business;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(4) any transaction between or among the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted Subsidiaries or any
Receivables Subsidiary;

(5) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities (including
under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses provided on behalf of,
directors, officers, consultants or employees of the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent (whether
directly or indirectly and including through any Person owned or controlled by any of such directors,
officers or employees);

(6) (i) the Original Notes Transactions, (ii) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Issuer or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries under the terms of any transaction pursuant to or contemplated by, and any
payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any agreement, understanding or instrument in effect as of
or on the Original Notes Issue Date or described in “Related Party Transactions” in the Original Notes

which the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or any Parent is required or permitted to file a consolidated tax
return, or the formation and maintenance of any consolidated group for tax, accounting or cash pooling or
management purposes in the ordinary course of business, provided that any such consolidated group
arrangement does not permit or require cash payment by the Issuer to any Parent in excess of the amount of
Tax that would be payable by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis;

(8) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services (including,
without limitation, pursuant to joint venture arrangements), in each case in the ordinary course of business,
which are fair to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of the
Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less
favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
and any Affiliate of the Issuer or an Associate or similar entity that would constitute an Affiliate Transaction
solely because the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary

Associate or similar entity;

approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors in their reasonable determination and
(b) any amendment, waiver or other transaction with respect to any Subordinated Shareholder Funding in
compliance with the other provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable;

Issuer in good faith; and (c) all reasonable out of pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Investors or any
Permitted Holder in connection with its direct or indirect investment in the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries (but, for the avoidance of doubt, excluding in respect of the acquisition of shares in the Issuer

Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is (i) fair to the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary from a financial standpoint or (ii) on terms not less favorable than might have been obtained in a

**_Reports_**

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee the following reports:

(1) within 120 days of the end of the Issuer’s fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ended December 31,
2020, annual reports containing, to the extent applicable:

(i) an operating and financial review of the audited financial statements, including a discussion of the
results of operation, financial condition, consolidated EBITDA and liquidity and capital resources;

(ii) unaudited pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of the Issuer (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall not include provision of a full income statement or balance sheet to the extent
not reasonably available, together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions,
dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed
fiscal year as to which such annual report relates; provided further that, if such pro forma financial
information is not reasonably available, the Issuer will provide, in the case of a material acquisition,
acquired company financials;

(iii) the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Issuer as at the end of the most recent fiscal year and
audited consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow of the Issuer for the most recent
two fiscal years, including appropriate footnotes to such financial statements, for and as at the end of
such fiscal years and the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements;

(iv) a description of the business, management and shareholders of the Issuer, all material affiliate
transactions, and a description of all material debt instruments; and

(v) a description of material operational risk factors and material subsequent events.

(2) within 60 days of the end of the first, second and third fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the Issuer
beginning with the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2021, quarterly financial statements of the Issuer
containing the following information:

(i) the Issuer’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as at the end of such quarter and unaudited
condensed statements of income and cash flow for the most recent quarter year to date period ending
on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date and the comparable prior period, together with
condensed footnote disclosure;

(ii) unaudited pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of the Issuer, together with
explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred
since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as to which such quarterly report relates
(provided that such pro forma financial information will be provided only to the extent available
without unreasonable expense, in which case the Issuer will provide, in the case of a material
acquisition, acquired company financials);

(iii) an operating and financial review of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of the
consolidated financial condition, results of operations, consolidated EBITDA and material changes in
liquidity and capital resources of the Issuer;

(iv) a discussion of material changes in material debt instruments since the most recent report; and

(v) material subsequent events and any material changes to the risk factors disclosed in the most recent
annual report, provided that the information described in clauses (iv) and (v) may be provided in the
footnotes to such financial statements; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Issuer announces publicly or any acquisition,
disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction that is material to the Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or a senior executive officer or director changes at the Issuer or a change in
auditors of the Issuer, a report containing a description of such event.

So long as the Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will also, within five Business Days after furnishing to the
Trustee the annual and quarterly reports required by clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this “Reports”
covenant, hold a conference call to discuss such reports and the results of operations for the relevant reporting
period. The Issuer shall provide notice of the conference call no fewer than three Business Days prior to the date
of the conference call required to be held in accordance with this paragraph, announcing the time and date of
such conference call and either including all information necessary to access the call or directing parties to
contact the appropriate person at the Issuer to obtain such information.

197


-----

In addition, the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of such parties,
any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for so long as the
Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by persons who are not “affiliates” under the Securities
Act.

Contemporaneously with the furnishing of each such report discussed above, the Issuer will also post such report
on the Issuer’s website.

The Issuer shall also make available to Holders and prospective holders of the Notes copies of all reports
furnished to the Trustee on the Issuer’s website and if and so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of
The International Stock Exchange and to the extent that the rules and regulations of the Authority so require, by
posting such reports on the official website of the Authority (www.tisegroup.com/).

All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of such
report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis for the
periods presented, except as may otherwise be described in such information; provided, however, that the reports
set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis
that applied to such periods. No report need include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the
Issuer or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not
of a type included in the Original Notes Offering Memorandum. In addition, the reports set forth above will not
be required to contain any reconciliation to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

To the extent comparable prior period financial information of the Issuer does not exist, the comparable prior
period financial information of the Company or special purpose financial information of the Issuer (incorporating
such Company financial information) may be provided in lieu thereof.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may satisfy its obligations under clauses (1) and (2) of the first
paragraph of this covenant by delivering the corresponding consolidated annual and quarterly reports of any
Parent. To the extent that material differences exist between the management, business, assets, shareholding or
results of operations or financial condition of the Issuer or any Parent that is the reporting entity (if applicable),
the annual and quarterly reports shall include an explanation and an unaudited reconciliation of such material
differences. Following an IPO on the Capital Stock of the Issuer or any Parent or Subsidiary thereof and/or the
listing of such Capital Stock on an internationally recognized stock exchange, the requirements of this covenant
shall be considered to have been fulfilled if the IPO Entity complies with the reporting requirements of such
stock exchange and reports consolidated EBITDA and, if the IPO Entity is different than the Issuer following
such IPO, and material differences exist between the assets, results of operations or financial condition of the
IPO Entity and the Issuer, then the annual and interim reports shall include an explanation and an unaudited
reconciliation of such material differences.

At any time that any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the
Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first paragraph of this “—Reports”
covenant will include (i) a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the
footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer or
(ii) stand-alone audited or unaudited financial statements, as the case may be, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary or
Unrestricted Subsidiaries, together with an unaudited reconciliation to the financial information of the Issuer and
its subsidiaries, which reconciliation shall include the following items: revenues, consolidated EBITDA, net
income, cash, total assets, total debt, shareholder equity, capital expenditures and interest expense.

For the purposes of this covenant, IFRS shall be deemed to be IFRS as in effect from time to time, without giving
effect to the proviso in the definition thereof.

All reports provided pursuant to this “—Reports” covenant shall be made in the English language.

In the event that (i) the Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports required by
Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Issuer elects to provide to the Trustee reports which, if filed with the SEC,
would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Issuer) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of
the Exchange Act (other than the provision of U.S. GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or information as

198


-----

to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Trustee such
annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the
SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d). Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Issuer will be
deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

Delivery of the above reports to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee’s receipt of such
reports will not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from
information contained therein, including the Issuer’s or any other parties’ compliance with any of its covenants in
the Indenture (as to which the Trustee will be entitled to rely exclusively on Officer’s Certificates that are
delivered).

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Issuer_

The Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose
of all or substantially all the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in one
transaction or a series of related transactions to, any Person, unless:

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Issuer”) will be a Person organized and existing
under the laws of any member state of the European Union, or the United States of America, any State of
the United States or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada, Norway or Switzerland
and the Successor Issuer (if not the Issuer) will expressly assume, (a) by supplemental indenture, executed
and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Issuer
under the Notes and the Indenture and (b) all obligations of the Issuer under the Intercreditor Agreement and
the relevant Security Documents, as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the Successor Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Successor Issuer as a result of such transaction as
having been Incurred by the Successor Issuer or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default
or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Successor Issuer would be able to Incur at
least an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio contained in the first
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b) the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio would not be less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to the
effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with the
Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture (if any) has been duly
authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal, valid and binding agreement enforceable against the
Successor Issuer (in each case, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee), provided that
in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact.

Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is deemed to be
Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of any such transaction
undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto, shall be
deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Issuer, which properties and
assets, if held by the Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties
and assets of the Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the
properties and assets of the Issuer.

The Successor Issuer will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the
Issuer under the Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the predecessor company
will not be released from its obligations under the Indenture or the Notes.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve
“all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

199


-----

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this “—Merger and
_Consolidation” covenant) shall not apply to (i) any transactions which constitute an Asset Disposition if the_
Issuer has complied with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” or
(ii) the creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary.

_Guarantors_

No Guarantor (other than a Guarantor whose guarantee is to be released in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement) may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving
corporation);

(2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of, all or substantially all of the assets of such
Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one transaction or a series of related
transactions, to any Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into it unless:

(A) the other Person is the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or becomes a Guarantor;

(B) (1) either (x) a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person
expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor under its Guarantee and the Indenture
(pursuant to a supplemental indenture executed and delivered in a form reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee); and (2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default or Event of Default shall
have occurred and is continuing; or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of a
Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of a Guarantor (in each case
other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Indenture,

_provided, however, that the prohibition in clauses (1), (2) and (3) of this paragraph shall not apply to the extent_
that compliance with paragraphs (A) and (B)(1) could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation of
statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules,
capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws rules or regulations (or analogous
restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case
of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a
Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or
(3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out of
pocket expenses.

The provisions set forth in this “—Merger and Consolidation” covenant shall not restrict (and shall not apply to):
(i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor from consolidating with, merging or liquidating into or
transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer, a Guarantor or any other Restricted
Subsidiary; (ii) a Guarantor from merging or liquidating into or transferring all or part of its properties and assets
to the Issuer or another Guarantor; (iii) any consolidation or merger of the Issuer into any Guarantor; provided
that, if the Issuer is not the surviving entity of such merger or consolidation, the relevant Guarantor will assume
the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable, and clauses (1) and (4) under the heading
“—The Issuer” shall apply to such transaction (iv) a Permitted Reorganization and (v) the Issuer or a Guarantor
changing legal domicile or legal form or consolidating into or merging or combining with an Affiliate
incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of such entity, reincorporating such
entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such entity; provided, however, that clauses (1), (2)
and (4) under the heading “—The Issuer” or clauses (3)(A) and (3)(B) under the heading “—Guarantors,” as the
case may be, shall apply to any such transaction.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If, on any date following the Original Notes Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no
Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning on that day
and continuing until such time, if any, at which the Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (the “Reversion
_Date”), the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply to the Notes:_

(1) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

200


-----

(2) “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

(3) “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(4) “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

(5) “—Impairment of Security Interest”;

(6) “—Future Guarantees”;

(7) “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”; and

(8) the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Merger and
_Consolidation—The Issuer,”_

and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be
applicable to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first day on
which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard
to actions of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during the continuance of the
Suspension Event, and no action taken prior to the Reversion Date will constitute a Default or Event of Default.
The “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date
of the Indenture but not during the continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness
Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be deemed to have been outstanding on the
Original Notes Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” In addition, the Indenture also permits, without
causing a Default or Event of Default, the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any contractual
commitments or take actions in the future after any date on which the Notes cease to have an Investment Grade
Status as long as the contractual commitments were entered into during the Suspension Event and not in
anticipation of the Notes no longer having an Investment Grade Status. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee and the
Holders of the Notes that the conditions set forth in the first paragraph under this caption has been satisfied,
_provided that, no such notification shall be a condition for the suspension or reversion of the covenants described_
under this caption to be effective. The Trustee shall not be obliged to notify the Holders of such event. There can
be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Status.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, and the Parent shall not, take or
knowingly or negligently omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security
Interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood, subject to the proviso below, that the Incurrence of
Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interest with
respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Issuer shall not, and shall not
permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the
Trustee and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral, except
that (i) the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Permitted Collateral Liens and may effect a Permitted
Reorganization and an IPO Release, and the Collateral may be discharged and released and retaken, and the
applicable Security Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise
modified, replaced or released, if applicable, in accordance with the Indenture, the applicable Security
Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (ii) the applicable
Security Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified,
replaced or released, from time to time to cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect or inconsistency therein;
_provided, however, that in the case of clause (i) above, except with respect to any discharge or release in_
accordance with the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the
Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens or any action expressly permitted by the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents may not be amended, extended,
renewed, restated, supplemented, released and retaken, if applicable, or otherwise modified or replaced, unless
contemporaneously with any such action, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee and the Security Agent, either (1) a
solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and the Security Agent from an
Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after
giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release,
modification or replacement, (2) a certificate from the Board of Directors of the relevant Person which confirms

201


-----

the solvency of the person granting such Security Interest after giving effect to any transactions related to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement or (3) an Opinion
of Counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and the Security Agent, confirming that,
after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement,
release, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Security Documents, so amended,
extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released, modified or replaced are valid Liens not otherwise subject
to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not
otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release,
modification or replacement.

In the event that the Issuer complies with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent
shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such amendments without the need for
instructions from the Holders.

**_Future Guarantees_**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this covenant, no Restricted Subsidiary shall Guarantee the
Indebtedness outstanding under the Super Senior Facilities, any other Indebtedness with an aggregate outstanding
principal amount in excess of €10.0 million or any other Public Debt, in each case of the Issuer or a Guarantor
unless such Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor on the date on which the Guarantee is Incurred and,
if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture pursuant to which such Restricted
Subsidiary will provide a Guarantee, which Guarantee will be senior to or pari passu with such Restricted
Subsidiary’s guarantee of such other Indebtedness; provided, however, that such Restricted Subsidiary shall not
be obligated to become such a Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Guarantee is
contrary to the Agreed Security Principles or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, or could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation of statutory limitations, corporate
benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance
and coordination rules or the laws rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction;
(2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a
partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a
partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or
obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out of pocket expenses. At the option of
the Issuer, any Guarantee may contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the extent reasonably necessary.

Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under “—Release of the Guarantees.”
A Guarantee of a Guarantor may also be released at the option of the Issuer if at the date of such release either
(i) there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Original Notes Issue Date
and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture if such Guarantor had not been
designated as a Guarantor, or (ii) there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred
after the Original Notes Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture as
at the date of such release if such Guarantor were not designated as a Guarantor as at that date. The Trustee and
the Security Agent shall each take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Guarantee in
accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications.

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the
Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other
things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial
assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and
similar principles. By virtue of such limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be
significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no
obligation under its Guarantee.

The validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of each Guarantor
will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in “Risk Factors” and “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” in the Offering_
Memorandum.

202


-----

**_Release of the Guarantees_**

The Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and release:

(1) upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital Stock of the
relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company) or the sale or disposition of all or
substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise
permitted by the Indenture;

(2) upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(3) upon (i) defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and
_Discharge” or (ii) the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the Issuer and the_
Guarantors under the Indenture and the Notes;

(4) with respect to a Guarantor that is not a Significant Subsidiary, so long as no Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, to the extent that such Guarantor is unconditionally released and discharged from its
liability with respect to the Super Senior Facilities and does not guarantee any other Public Debt;

(5) in accordance with an enforcement action pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

(6) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(7) as described in the covenant described under “—Future Guarantees”;

(8) pursuant to a Permitted Reorganization or as a result of a transaction permitted by “—Merger and
_Consolidation—Guarantors”; or_

(9) upon the solvent liquidation or winding-up of a Guarantor.

At the request of the Issuer, the Trustee shall take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or
waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release
of a Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each
of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee without the consent of the Holders. Neither the
Trustee nor the Issuer will be required to make a notation on the Notes to reflect any such release, termination or
discharge.

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture provides that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the Incurrence by the Issuer or its
Restricted Subsidiaries of any Indebtedness permitted pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness” or as contemplated by the Intercreditor Agreement, the Issuer, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries,_
the Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized
Representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) or a restatement,
amendment or other modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same terms as the
Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders), including containing substantially
the same terms with respect to release of Guarantees and priority and release of the Security Interest; provided
that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security
Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties,
liabilities, indemnifications or immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Indenture or the
Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture also provides that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders, the Trustee
and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or any Security Document to: (1) cure any ambiguity,
omission, defect or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness
covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to
any such agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the
Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
(4) further secure the Notes (including Subsequent Additional Notes), (5) make provision for equal and ratable
pledges of the Collateral to secure Subsequent Additional Notes, (6) implement any Permitted Liens or Permitted
Collateral Liens, (7) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance
with the terms thereof or (8) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the

203


-----

Holders in any material respect. The Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter
into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Holders of the majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under
“—Amendments and Waivers” or as permitted by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any
amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security
Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties,
liabilities, indemnifications or immunities under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the Holders to the payment,
repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations
subordinated to the Notes thereby; provided, however, that such transaction would comply with the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

The Indenture also provides that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and
accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
(whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have
directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement. A copy of
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall be made available for inspection
during normal business hours on any Business Day upon prior written request at our offices or at the offices of
the listing agent.

The Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the listing of the Notes on the Official List of
The International Stock Exchange for so long as such Notes are outstanding; provided that if at any time the
Issuer determines that it will not maintain such listing, it will obtain prior to the delisting of the Notes from the
Official List of The International Stock Exchange, and thereafter use its commercially reasonable efforts to
maintain, a listing of such Notes on another recognized stock exchange.

**_Lines of Business_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, engage in any business other than a Similar
Business, except to such extent as would not be material to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole.

**_Financial Calculations_**

When calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Indenture, in each case in connection with
any acquisition, disposition, merger, joint venture, investment, incurrence, payment, change of control or other
similar transaction where there is a time difference between commitment and closing or payment or incurrence
(including in respect of incurrence of Indebtedness, Restricted Payments and Permitted Investments), the date of
determination of such basket or ratio and of any Default or Event of Default shall, at the option of the Issuer, be
the date the binding or definitive agreements for such acquisition, disposition, merger, joint venture, investment,
commitment, payment, change of control, transaction, event or other similar transaction are entered into and such
baskets or ratios shall be calculated on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such acquisition, disposition,
merger, joint venture, investment, indebtedness, payment, change of control or similar transaction and the other
transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of
proceeds thereof) as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period for purposes of
determining the ability to consummate any such transaction (and not for purposes of any subsequent availability
of any basket or ratio). For the avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such baskets or ratios are exceeded as a result of
fluctuations in such basket or ratio (including due to fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer or the
target company) subsequent to such date of determination and at or prior to the consummation of the relevant
transaction or arrangement, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such
fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the relevant transaction or arrangement and the related
transactions are permitted hereunder and (y) such baskets or ratios shall not be tested at the time of
consummation of such transaction or arrangement or related transactions; provided that if the Issuer elects to
have such determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement, any such transactions

204


-----

(including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) shall be deemed to have occurred on
the date the definitive agreements are entered and outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets
or ratios under the Indenture after the date of such agreement and before the consummation of such transaction or
arrangement.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest or Additional Amounts on any Note issued under the Indenture when due
and payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under the
Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon
declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or the Parent to comply for 60 days after written
notice by the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes with its
other agreements contained in the Indenture (other than a default in performance, or breach, of a covenant or
agreement which is specifically addressed in clauses (1) or (2) above);

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there
may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries)
other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or
Guarantee now exists, or is created after the Original Notes Issue Date, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately upon the
expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross acceleration
_provision”),_

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any
other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of which has been so
accelerated, aggregates €25.0 million or more;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary or
group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial
statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the
“bankruptcy provisions”);

(6) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as
of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of €25.0 million (exclusive
of any amounts that a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability for), which judgments are not
paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the judgment becomes final (the “judgment default
_provision”);_

(7) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect
(other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement,
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture and except through the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Trustee or Security Agent) with respect to Collateral having a fair market value in excess
of €10.0 million for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture or the
release of any such security interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents or any such security interest
created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Issuer shall assert in writing that any
such security interest is invalid or unenforceable, and (in each case) any such Default continues for 10 days;
and

(8) any Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with
the terms of such Guarantee or the Indenture) or is declared invalid or unenforceable in a judicial
proceeding or any Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations under its Guarantee and (in each
case) any such Default continues for 10 days.

However, a default under clause (3), (4) or (6) above will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or
the Holders of 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture notify the Issuer of the

205


-----

default and, with respect to such clauses the Issuer does not cure such default within the time specified in such
clauses, as applicable, of this paragraph after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is continuing, the
Trustee by notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under
the Indenture by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders
shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes under the
Indenture to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid
interest will be due and payable immediately. The Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any Default or
Event of Default unless a written notice of any event which is in fact such a default is received by a Responsible
Officer of the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and such notice references the Notes and the
Indenture. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in
clause (4) above under “—Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of
the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of
Default pursuant to clause (4) above shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or
the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after
the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes
would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of
Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest on the Notes that became due solely because of the
acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any,
and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any
declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not
enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all past or
existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or
Additional Amounts, if any) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if
rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at
the request or direction of any of the Holders, unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee, and the Trustee
has received, indemnity and/or security (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to the Trustee against any
loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no
Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes, unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue
the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability
or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer
of security and/or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a
direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given
the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

The Indenture provides that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, of which a
responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the
Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in

206


-----

the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or
the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would
involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be
entitled to indemnification and/or security (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to it in its sole
discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. Prior to the occurrence of an
Event of Default, the Trustee will have no obligation to monitor compliance by the Issuer with the Indenture. The
Indenture provides that if a Default occurs and is continuing and a responsible officer of the Trustee is informed
in writing in accordance with the terms of the Indenture of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give
notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a
Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold
notice if and so long as the Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The
Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s
Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during
the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof,
written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what
action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

The Indenture provides that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with
another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to
report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further
action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the
covenant entitled “Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any
other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by
such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period
specified in the Indenture.

The Indenture provides for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only
if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured (including by way of pre-funding) to its satisfaction. It may not be
possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the
Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for
Holders to take action directly.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified with
the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) and, subject to
certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the
Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes). However, without the consent of
Holders holding not less than 90% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes affected, then
outstanding, an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, waiver or
modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Note or change the time at which any Note may be
redeemed, in each case as described above under “—Optional Redemption”;

(5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Note;

(6) impair the right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or with respect to
such Holder’s Notes;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “—Withholding Taxes” that adversely
affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends the terms of such Notes in a
way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an exemption
from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder, unless the Issuer or the applicable
Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

207


-----

(8) release all or substantially all of the security interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral
other than in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture or the applicable Security Documents;

(9) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest or
Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the
Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment
default that resulted from such acceleration);

(10) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Guarantee or the Indenture, except in accordance
with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement any applicable Additional Intercreditor
Agreement; and

(11) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent described in
this sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Security Agent and
the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Notes Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer, or any Restricted
Subsidiary under any Notes Document;

(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any right or
power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or that does
not adversely affect the rights or benefits to the Trustee or any of the Holders in any material respect under
the Notes Documents;

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of
the Issuer) for the issuance of Subsequent Additional Notes;

(6) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Guarantee in accordance with the covenants described
under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “—Certain Covenants—Future Guarantees,”
to add Guarantees with respect to the Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of the Notes, or to confirm
and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Guarantee or Lien (including the
Collateral and the Security Documents) or any amendment in respect thereof with respect to or securing the
Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking or amendment is provided for under the
Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Notes to any provision of the
“Description of the Notes” section of the Original Notes Offering Memorandum to the extent that such
provision in the “Description of the Notes” was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the
Indenture, the Security Documents or the Notes;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee or Security Agent pursuant to
the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee or Security Agent to any Notes
Document;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in favor
of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Super Senior Facilities, in any property
which is required by the Security Documents or the Super Senior Facilities (as in effect on the Original
Notes Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required to be
granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a security interest in the Collateral for the
benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such security interest is not prohibited by the Indenture
or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant described under
“—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” is complied with; or

(10) as provided in “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements.”

In formulating its decision on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely absolutely on such
evidence as it deems necessary, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed
amendment of any Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed

208


-----

amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder of Notes given in
connection with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Notes have concurred in any
direction, waiver or consent, the Notes owned by the Issuer or by any Person directly or indirectly controlled, or
controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the Issuer will be disregarded and deemed not to
be outstanding.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and the
Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain
obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and
indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning
issuing temporary Notes, registration of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of
an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the
Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate (other than with
respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate its and the Guarantors’ obligations under the covenants described under
“Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (1) and (2) of “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”) and
“—Change of Control” and the default provisions relating to such covenants described under “Events of Default”
above, the operation of the cross-default upon a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the
bankruptcy provisions with respect to the Issuer and Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision, the
guarantee provision and the security default provision described under “Events of Default” above (“covenant
_defeasance”)._

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of
its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not
be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to such Notes. If the Issuer exercises its covenant
defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of
Default specified in clause (3), (4), (5) (with respect only to the Significant Subsidiaries), (6) or (7) under
“Events of Default” above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance trust”)
with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed as agent by the Trustee for this purpose) cash in euros
or euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a combination thereof sufficient for the payment of
principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must
comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that the beneficial owners of the Notes will not
recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and
defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and
at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the
case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United States must be based on a ruling of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating,
hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to customary
assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to legal
defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with;

(4) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not constitute, or is
qualified as, a regulated investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended;
and

(5) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee all other documents or other information that the Trustee may reasonably
require in connection with either defeasance option.

209


-----

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and cease to be of further
effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Notes, as expressly provided for
in the Indenture) as to all outstanding Notes when: (1) either: (a) all the Notes previously authenticated and
delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes, and certain Notes for which provision for payment
was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Paying
Agent for cancellation; or (b) all Notes not previously delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation (i) have
become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to
be called for redemption within one year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving
of notice of redemption by the Paying Agent in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has
deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another entity designated by the Trustee for this
purpose), money or euro-denominated European Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, as
applicable, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Notes not previously
delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit
(in the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case
may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; (4) the Issuer has
delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the funds deposited towards the payment of the Notes at
maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be; and (5) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an
Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each to the effect that all conditions precedent under the
“Satisfaction and Discharge” section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture
have been complied with, provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of
fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor under the Notes
Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each
Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the
consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S.
federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee**

Deutsche Trustee Company Limited has been appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture provides
that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has
received written notice in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Trustee will perform only such duties
as are set forth specifically in the Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default of which a responsible
officer of the Trustee has received written notice in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Trustee will
exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of care that a
prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain
from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Indenture imposes certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the Issuer,
to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such
claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Issuer and
its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture sets out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced. Such terms will
include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority in principal
amount of the then outstanding Note, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Issuer and (2) that
if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated, or (b) becomes incapable
of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder
who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee
and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the
successor Trustee.

210


-----

The Indenture contains provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, taxes, expenses
incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

For so long as any of the Notes are listed on The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited and the rules of
The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited so require, notices with respect to the Notes will be
published, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, on the official website of The International
Stock Exchange Authority Limited (www.tisegroup.com/). In addition, for so long as any Notes are represented
by Global Notes, all notices to Holders of the Notes will be delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer to Euroclear
and Clearstream.

All notices to Holders of the Notes will be validly given if mailed to them at their respective addresses in the
register of Holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more than
once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are mailed, such
notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after being so
mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or
other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed.
Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with
respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given,
whether or not the addressee receives it. For so long as any Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices to
Holders of the Notes may be delivered via Euroclear and Clearstream in lieu of notice via registered mail.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the Notes will
be prescribed 10 years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against the Issuer and the
Guarantors for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed five years after the applicable due date for
payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions**

The euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the Guarantors, if
any, under or in connection with the Notes and the Guarantees, if any, including damages. Any amount received
or recovered in a currency other than euro, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a
court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by any
Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a Guarantor will only
constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the euro amount which the
recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that
receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is
practicable to do so).

If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under any
Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors, if any, will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or
the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors, if any, will indemnify the recipient or the
Trustee on a joint or several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency
indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Note or the

the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent
obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent
cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Note or the Trustee (other than a
waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment,
order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or any Guarantee, or to
the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any eurodenominated restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a
non-euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such
non-euro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

Temporary Notes sold within the United States to “qualified institutional buyers” in reliance on Rule 144A
(“Rule 144A Temporary Notes”) will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form
without interest coupons attached (the “Rule 144A Temporary Global Notes”). Temporary Notes sold outside the
United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act (“Regulation S Temporary Notes) will initially
be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
“Regulation S Temporary Global Notes” and, together with the Rule 144A Temporary Global Notes, the
“Temporary Global Notes”). On the Issue Date, the Temporary Global Notes will be deposited with a common
depository and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depository for the accounts of Euroclear
and Clearstream.

Additional Notes issued in exchange for the Rule 144A Temporary Notes on or about the Completion Date
(“Rule 144A Additional Notes”) will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form
without interest coupons attached (the “Rule 144A Additional Global Notes”). Additional Notes issued in
exchange for the Regulation S Temporary Notes on or about the Completion Date (“Regulation S Additional
Notes”) will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons
attached (the “Regulation S Additional Global Notes” and, together with the Rule 144A Additional Global Notes,
the “Additional Global Notes” and, together with the global notes for the Original Notes, the “Global Notes”).
On or about the Completion Date, the Additional Global Notes will be deposited with a common depositary and
registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Temporary Global Notes (the “Rule 144A Temporary Book-Entry
Interests”) and ownership of interests in the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes (the “Regulation S Temporary
Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the Rule 144A Temporary Book-Entry Interests, the “Temporary BookEntry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that
hold interests through such participants.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Additional Global Notes (the “Rule 144A Additional Book-Entry
Interests” and, together with the book-entry interests in the Rule 144A Global Note for the Original Notes, the
“Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests”) and ownership of interests in the Regulation S Additional Global Notes (the
“Regulation S Additional Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the book-entry interests in the Rule
Regulation S Global Note for the Original Notes, the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the
Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with
Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that hold interests through such participants.

Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Temporary Global Notes and the Additional Global Notes on
behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their
respective depositories. Except under the limited circumstances described below, Temporary Book-Entry
Interests and Book-Entry Interests will not be issued in definitive form.

Temporary Book-Entry Interests and Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be
effected only through, records maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their
participants. The Temporary Book-Entry Interests and Book-Entry Interests in the Temporary Notes and the
Global Notes, as applicable, will be issued only in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000
in excess thereof. The Temporary Book-Entry Interests and Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive
form. Instead Euroclear and Clearstream will credit a participant’s account on their book entry transfer and
registration systems with the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions,
including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical
delivery of those securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer
or pledge Temporary Book-Entry Interests and Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Temporary Notes and
the Additional Notes are in global form, holders of Temporary Book-Entry Interests and Book-Entry Interests, as
applicable, will not be considered the owners or “holders” of Temporary Notes or Additional Notes under the
Temporary Indenture or the Indenture, as applicable, for any purpose.

So long as the Temporary Notes or the Additional Notes, as applicable, are held in global form, the common
depositary of Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or its respective nominees), will be considered the sole holders of
the Temporary Global Notes or the Additional Global Notes, as applicable, for all purposes under the Temporary

243


-----

Indenture or the Indenture, respectively. In addition, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and the
participants through which they own Temporary Book-Entry Interests or Book-Entry Interests in order to transfer
their interests or exercise any rights of holders of the Temporary Notes or Additional Notes under the Temporary
Indenture or the Indenture, respectively.

None of the Issuer, the Guarantors or any of the Temporary Trustee, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the Paying
Agent, the Registrar or any of their respective agents will have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of
the records relating to the Temporary Book-Entry Interests or the Book-Entry Interests.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Temporary Indenture or the Indenture, owners of the Temporary Book-Entry Interests and
Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive Temporary Notes or Additional Notes, as applicable, in registered
form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”) only in the following circumstances:

(i) if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary
and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days; or

(ii) the owner of a Temporary Book-Entry Interest or Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing
delivered through Euroclear or Clearstream following an “Event of Default” under the Temporary Indenture
or the Indenture, as applicable.

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Temporary Book-Entry
Interest or a Book-Entry Interest described in the immediately preceding clause (ii), their current procedure is to
request that the Issuer issue or cause to be issued Temporary Notes or Additional Notes, as applicable, in
definitive registered form to all owners of Temporary Book-Entry Interests and Book-Entry Interests and not
only to the owner who made the initial request.

In such an event, the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and issued
in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream or the Issuer, as applicable
(in accordance with its respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants
reflecting the beneficial ownership of Temporary Book-Entry Interests and Book-Entry Interests), and such
Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the Temporary Indenture or the
Indenture, as applicable, unless that legend is not required by the Temporary Indenture or the Indenture, as
applicable, or applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Temporary Trustee, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, any Transfer
Agent and the Registrar shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Temporary Global Note or Global
Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such.
Ownership of the Temporary Global Notes or the Global Notes will be evidenced through registration from time
to time at the registered office of the Issuer, and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the Notes.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Temporary Notes or the Additional Notes;
however, owners of the Temporary Book-Entry Interests and the Book-Entry Interests may incur fees normally
payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable.

The Issuer will not be required to register the transfer or exchange of Definitive Registered Notes for a period of
15 calendar days preceding (i) the record date for any payment of interest on the Temporary Notes or the
Additional Notes, (ii) any date fixed for redemption of the Temporary Notes or the Additional Notes or (iii) the
date fixed for selection of the Temporary Notes or the Additional Notes to be redeemed in part. The Issuer is also
not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Temporary Notes or Additional Notes selected for
redemption or which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a change of
control offer or asset sale offer. In the event of the transfer of any Definitive Registered Note, the Temporary
Trustee or the Trustee, as applicable, may require a holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate
endorsements and transfer documents as described in the Temporary Indenture or the Indenture, as applicable.
The Issuer may require a holder to pay any transfer taxes and fees required by law and permitted by the
Temporary Indenture, the Temporary Notes, the Indenture and the Additional Notes, as applicable.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such a Definitive Registered Note has
been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Note is mutilated and is surrendered to
the Registrar or at the office of a transfer agent, the Issuer will issue and the Temporary Trustee or the Trustee (or

244


-----

an authentication agent appointed by it), as applicable, will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered
Note if the Temporary Trustee’s or the Trustee’s, as applicable, and the Issuer’s requirements are met. The Issuer
or the Temporary Trustee or the Trustee, as applicable, may require a holder requesting replacement of a
Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both to protect themselves,
the Registrar or the Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the Temporary Indenture or the Indenture, as applicable,
from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. The Issuer, Registrar, the
Temporary Trustee and Trustee may charge for any expenses incurred by it in replacing a Definitive Registered
Note.

If any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to become due
and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by the Issuer pursuant to the provisions of the Temporary
Indenture or the Indenture, as applicable, the Issuer, in its discretion, may, instead of issuing a new Definitive
Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged only after the transferor first delivers to the
Temporary Trustee or the Trustee, as applicable, a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to
the effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Temporary Notes or
Additional Notes, as applicable. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event that any Temporary Global Note or Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/
or Clearstream, as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book Entry Interests in such Temporary
Global Note or Global Note, as applicable, from the amount received by them in respect of the redemption of
such Temporary Global Note or Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of
such Book Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in
connection with the redemption of such Temporary Global Note or Global Note (or any portion thereof). The
Issuer understands that, under the existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes
are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a
proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions), by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and
appropriate; provided, however, that no Temporary Book-Entry Interest or Book-Entry Interest of less than
€100,000 principal amount may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

The Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Temporary Global Notes or the Global
Notes (including principal, premium, if any, interest and additional amounts, if any) to the Paying Agent, which
will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, such payments will be credited to participants’
accounts in accordance with their customary procedures. The Issuer expects that standing customer instructions
and customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of Temporary Book-Entry Interests or
Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Temporary Indenture and the Indenture, the Issuer, the Temporary Trustee, the Trustee,
the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar and any of their respective agents will treat the registered
holders of the Temporary Global Notes and the Global Notes (e.g., the common depositary (or its respective
nominee)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently,
none of the Issuer, the Temporary Trustee, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or
any of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

Š any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or
payments made on account of, a Temporary Book-Entry Interest or Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear or Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to, or payments made on account of, a Temporary Book-Entry Interests or a Book-Entry Interests;

Š any other matter relating to the actions and practices of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect
participant (including payments made); or

Š the records of the common depositary.

Payments by participants to owners of a Temporary Book-Entry Interest or Book-Entry Interest held through
participants are the responsibility of such participant.

245


-----

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of the Temporary
Global Notes and the Global Notes will be paid to holders of interests in such Temporary Notes and Additional
Notes, as applicable, through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in euro.

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any regulations of the
applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. None of the Issuer, the Temporary Trustee, the Trustee, the Initial
Purchasers, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or any of their respective agents will be liable to
any holder of a Temporary Global Note or Global Note or any other person for any commissions, costs, losses or
expenses in relation to or resulting from any currency conversion or rounding effected in connection with any
such payment. Holders may be subject to foreign exchange risks that may have economic and tax consequences
to them.

**Action by Owners of Temporary Book-Entry Interests and Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of a
Temporary Note or an Additional Note (including the presentation of Temporary Notes or Additional Notes for
exchange as described above) only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Temporary
Book-Entry Interest or Book-Entry Interests in the Temporary Global Notes or Global Notes, as applicable, are
credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Temporary Notes or Additional
Notes, as applicable, as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and
Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action
in respect of the Temporary Global Notes or the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the
relevant Temporary Notes or the Additional Notes, Euroclear and Clearstream, at the request of the holders of
such Temporary Notes or Additional Notes, reserve the right to exchange the Temporary Global Notes or the
Global Notes, as applicable, for Definitive Registered Notes, and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes
to their participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in accordance with Euroclear’s and
Clearstream’s rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder of a Temporary Note or an
Additional Note requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell
Temporary Notes or Additional Notes, as applicable, to persons in states that require the physical delivery of
such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder of Temporary Notes or Additional Notes must transfer its
interests in the Temporary Global Notes or Global Notes, as applicable, in accordance with the normal
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture.

The Temporary Global Notes and the Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth under “Transfer
_Restrictions.” Book-Entry Interests in the Temporary Global Notes and the Global Notes will be subject to the_
restrictions on transfers and certification requirements discussed under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Transfers of Rule 144A Temporary Book-Entry Interests and Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing
to take delivery of Rule 144A Temporary Book-Entry Interests and Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests, respectively
will at all times be subject to such transfer restrictions.

Rule 144A Temporary Book-Entry Interests and Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person
who takes delivery in the form of a Regulation S Temporary Book-Entry Interest or Regulation S Book-Entry
Interest, as applicable, only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the
Temporary Indenture or the Indenture, as applicable) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance
with Regulation S or Rule 144 or any other exemption (if available under the Securities Act).

Regulation S Temporary Book-Entry Interests and Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a
person who takes delivery in the form of a Rule 144A Temporary Book-Entry Interest or Rule 144A Book-Entry
Interest, as applicable, only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the
Temporary Indenture or the Indenture, as applicable) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person
who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a
transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions
described under “Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any other
jurisdiction.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Temporary Book-Entry Interest or
Regulation S Book-Entry Interests for a Rule 144A Temporary Book-Entry Interest or Rule 144A Book-Entry
Interest, as applicable, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the

246


-----

Regulation S Temporary Global Note or the Regulation S Global Note, as applicable, and a corresponding
increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Temporary Global Note or the Rule 144A Global Note, as
applicable.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Temporary Book-Entry Interests or BookEntry Interests in a Temporary Global Note or Global Note, as applicable, only as described under “Description
_of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only if the transferor first delivers to the Temporary_
Trustee or the Trustee, as applicable, a written certificate (in the form provided in the Temporary Indenture or the
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such
Temporary Notes or Additional Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

Any Temporary Book-Entry Interest or Book-Entry Interest in one of the Temporary Global Notes or the Global
Notes, as applicable, that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Temporary Book-Entry
Interest or Book-Entry Interest in any other Temporary Global Note or Global Note, as applicable will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Temporary Book-Entry Interest or Book-Entry Interest, respectively, in the first mentioned
Temporary Global Note and Global Note, respectively, and become a Temporary Book-Entry Interest or BookEntry Interest in such other Temporary Global Note or Global Note, and accordingly will thereafter be subject to
all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable Temporary Book-Entry Interests and Book-Entry
Interests in such other Temporary Global Note or Global Note, as applicable for as long as it remains such a
Temporary Book-Entry Interest or Book-Entry Interest.

**Pledges**

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect
participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a Temporary Book-Entry Interest or Book-Entry Interest
to pledge such interest to persons or entities who or that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream
systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate
for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in
definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited.

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Temporary Book-Entry Interests and Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable. We provide the following summaries of those operations and
procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of the settlement system are
controlled by the settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither the Issuer, the Temporary Trustee,
the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar nor any of the Initial Purchasers are responsible
for those operations or procedures.

The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold
securities for participating organizations. They facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions
between their participants through electronic book entry changes in accounts of such participants. Euroclear and
Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance,
settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with
domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as
underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect
access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust
companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant,
either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can act only on behalf of participants, who or that in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to
persons or entities who or that do not participate in the Euroclear and/or Clearstream system, or otherwise take
actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws
of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form.
Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of
beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the
Temporary 144A Global Notes and the 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**Special Timing Considerations**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving the Temporary Notes and the Additional Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on

247


-----

days when those systems are open for business. In addition, because of time zone differences, there may be
complications with completing transactions involving Euroclear and/or Clearstream on the same business day as
in the United States. United States investors who or that wish to transfer their interests in the Temporary Notes
and Additional Notes, or to receive or make a payment or delivery of Temporary Notes and Additional Notes, as
applicable, on a particular day, may find that the transactions will not be performed until the next business day in
Brussels, if Euroclear is used, or in Luxembourg, if Clearstream is used.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System**

The Temporary Notes represented by the Temporary Global Notes and the Additional Notes represented by the
Additional Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of the Exchange. Transfers of interests in
the Temporary Global Notes and the Additional Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream
will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective system’s rules and operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of
interests in the Temporary Global Notes and the Additional Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or
Clearstream, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such
procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer or any of the Guarantors, the Initial
Purchasers, the Temporary Trustee, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or the Paying Agent will have
any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants of
their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Temporary Notes will be made in euro. Temporary Book-Entry Interests owned through
Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in
registered form. Temporary Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear
and Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value of the
settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Temporary Book-Entry Interests and Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear and
Clearstream and will settle in same day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important
to establish at the time of trading of any Temporary Book-Entry Interests or Book-Entry Interests where both the
purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

**U.S. Federal Income Taxation**

The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and
disposition by a U.S. Holder (as defined below) of the Temporary Notes and the Additional Notes into which
such Temporary Notes may be exchanged (collectively, for purposes of this discussion, the “Notes”). This
summary deals only with initial purchasers of Temporary Notes at the “issue price” (the first price at which a
substantial amount of Temporary Notes is sold for money, excluding sales to underwriters, placement agents or
wholesalers) in the initial offering that are U.S. Holders, that receive such Additional Notes in exchange for such
Temporary Notes, and that will hold the Notes as capital assets. The discussion does not cover all aspects of U.S.
federal income taxation that may be relevant to, or the actual tax effect that any of the matters described herein
will have on, the acquisition, ownership or disposition of Notes by particular investors (including consequences
under the alternative minimum tax or net investment income tax), and does not address any U.S. federal tax laws
other than U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws.
This summary also does not discuss all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to certain types of investors
subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws (such as financial institutions, insurance
companies, individual retirement accounts and other tax-deferred accounts, tax-exempt organizations, dealers in
securities or currencies, investors that will hold the Notes as part of straddles, hedging transactions or conversion
transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes, persons that have ceased to be U.S. citizens or lawful
permanent residents of the United States, investors holding the Notes in connection with a trade or business
conducted outside of the United States, U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents living abroad or investors
whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar).

As used herein, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of Notes that is, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, (i) an individual citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation (or other entity treated as a
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized under the laws of the United States, any
state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax
without regard to its source or (iv) a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary
supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all
substantial decisions of the trust, or the trust has validly elected to be treated as a domestic trust for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

The U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S.
federal income tax purposes that holds Notes will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the
partnership. Prospective purchasers that are entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal
income tax purposes should consult their tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences to
them and their partners of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of Notes by the partnership.

This summary is based on the tax laws of the United States including the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the “Code”), its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations thereunder, published rulings and
court decisions, all as of the date hereof and all subject to change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect.

**IN TAX LAW.**

**_Transactions Related to the Acquisition_**

Although the issue is not free from doubt, the Issuer intends to take the position, and the remainder of this
discussion assumes, that the Transactions that will occur in connection with the release of the gross proceeds of
the Offering from the relevant Escrow Account and the automatic exchange of the Temporary Notes for the
Additional Notes should not result in a taxable event for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If this position is
respected, a U.S. Holder would not recognize any income, gain or loss in connection with such transactions. U.S.
Holders should consult their tax advisers regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences to them of the
transactions related to the release of the offering proceeds and the Fidelix Acquisition.

-----

**_Pre-Issuance Accrued Interest_**

A portion of the purchase price of the Notes will be attributable to the amount of interest accrued after
December 15, 2020 and prior to the date the additional notes are issued (the “pre-issuance accrued interest”). The
Issuer intends to take the position that a portion of the first interest payment on the Notes, equal to the amount of
pre-issuance accrued interest, will be treated as a nontaxable return of the pre-issuance accrued interest. The
remainder of this discussion assumes that the first interest payment on the Notes will be so treated, and
references to interest in the remainder of this discussion exclude pre-issuance accrued interest. U.S. Holders
should consult their tax advisers concerning the U.S. federal income tax treatment of pre-issuance accrued
interest.

**_Payments of Interest_**

_General_

Subject to the discussion of amortizable bond premium below, payments of stated interest on a Note (without
reduction for any amounts withheld and including payments of any Additional Amounts) will be taxable to a U.S.
Holder as ordinary income at the time it is received or accrued, depending on such U.S. Holder’s method of
accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Prospective purchasers should consult their tax advisors
concerning the applicability of the foreign tax credit and source of income rules to income attributable to the
Notes.

_Foreign Currency Denominated Interest_

The amount of income recognized by a cash basis U.S. Holder will be the U.S. dollar value of the euro interest
payment, based on the exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact
converted into U.S. dollars.

An accrual basis U.S. Holder may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to an interest
payment denominated in euros in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, the amount of
income accrued will be based on the average exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual period (or, in the
case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. Holder, the part of the period within each taxable
year).

Under the second method, the U.S. Holder may elect to determine the amount of income accrued on the basis of
the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two
taxable years, the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the part of the period within each taxable year).
Additionally, if a payment of interest is actually received within five business days of the last day of the accrual
period, an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder may instead translate the accrued interest into U.S. dollars at the
exchange rate in effect on the day of actual receipt. Any such election will apply to all debt instruments held by
the U.S. Holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by
the U.S. Holder, and will be irrevocable without the consent of the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”).

Upon receipt of the interest payment (including a payment attributable to accrued but unpaid interest upon the
sale or retirement of a Note) denominated in foreign currency, the accrual basis U.S. Holder may recognize U.S.
source exchange gain or loss (taxable as U.S.-source ordinary income or loss) equal to the difference between the
amount received (translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date of receipt) and the amount previously
accrued, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars.

_Notes Purchased at a Premium_

A U.S. Holder that purchases a Note for an amount in excess of its principal amount may elect to treat the excess
as “amortizable bond premium.” In such case, the amount required to be included in the U.S. Holder’s income
each year with respect to interest on the Note will be reduced by the amount of amortizable bond premium
allocable (based on the Note’s yield to maturity) to that year. Bond premium with respect to a Note will be
computed in Euro, and amortizable bond premium that is taken into account currently will reduce interest income
in Euro. On the date amortized bond premium offsets interest income, a U.S. Holder will recognize U.S. source
exchange gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar
values of the amount of such amortized bond premium (i) on the date such amortized bond premium offsets
interest income and (ii) on the date on which the U.S. Holder acquired the Notes.

A U.S. Holder that does not elect to take amortizable bond premium into account currently will recognize gain or
loss on the sale or retirement of the Notes in the manner described below under “—Sale, Exchange,

250


-----

_Redemption, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes.” Any election to amortize bond premium_
applies to all bonds (other than bonds the interest on which is excludible from gross income for U.S. federal
income tax purposes) held by the U.S. Holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election
applies or thereafter acquired by the U.S. Holder, and is irrevocable without the consent of the IRS.

**_Occurrence of a EURIBOR Phase-Out Event for Notes Linked to or Referencing EURIBOR_**

Under certain circumstances, the Rate Determination Agent is required to select a successor rate to EURIBOR
(see “Description of the Notes—Interest”). If a EURIBOR Phase-Out Event occurs, the tax treatment of a U.S.
Holder holding Notes linked to or referencing EURIBOR will depend on whether a replacement of EURIBOR
with a Successor Rate is treated as a “significant modification” that results in a deemed exchange of the existing
Notes for “new” Notes. In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a significant modification occurs if,
based on all the facts and circumstances and taking into account all modifications of the debt instrument
collectively, the legal rights or obligations that are altered and the degree to which they are altered are
economically significant. A modification is generally any alteration, including any deletion or addition, in whole
or in part, of a legal right or obligation of the issuer or a holder of a debt instrument. The applicable regulations
provide, however, that alterations that occur as a result of the operation of the terms of the debt instrument are
not considered modifications for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

The terms of the Notes generally provide for a Successor Rate in case of a EURIBOR Phase-Out Event.
Therefore, such replacement, if any, should occur as a result of the operation of the terms of the Notes and should
not result in a modification of the Notes. Although the matter is not entirely free from doubt, the Issuer intends to
take the position that the occurrence of a EURIBOR Phase-Out Event should not constitute a modification of the
terms of the Notes, and the U.S. Holders should not recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax
purposes as a result of the occurrence of a EURIBOR Phase-Out Event. U.S. Holders should consult their tax
advisors concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences to them of the replacement of EURIBOR with a
Successor Rate upon occurrence of a EURIBOR Phase-Out Event.

**_Sale, Exchange, Redemption, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes_**

A U.S. Holder generally will recognize gain or loss on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other
taxable disposition of a Note equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale, exchange,
redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis of the Note, in each
case as determined in U.S. dollars. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note generally will be its U.S. dollar
cost, reduced by any amortized bond premium applied to reduce interest on a Note. The amount realized does not
include the amount attributable to accrued but unpaid interest, which will be taxable as interest income to the
extent not previously included in income. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors about how to
account for proceeds received on the sale or retirement of Notes that are not paid in U.S. dollars.

A U.S. Holder will recognize U.S. source exchange rate gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) on the
sale or retirement of a Note equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar values of the U.S. Holder’s
purchase price for the Note (i) on the date of sale or retirement and (ii) the date on which the U.S. Holder
acquired the Note. Any such exchange rate gain or loss (including any exchange gain or loss with respect to the
receipt of accrued but unpaid interest) will be realized only to the extent of total gain or loss realized on the sale
or retirement.

Except to the extent of changes in exchange rates, gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on the sale or
retirement of a Note will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the Note was held by
the U.S. Holder for more than one year. Non-corporate U.S. Holders generally are subject to tax on long-term
capital gains at reduced rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

Gain or loss realized by a U.S. Holder on the sale or retirement of a Note generally will be U.S. source.
Prospective purchasers should consult their tax advisors as to the foreign tax credit implications of the sale or
retirement of Notes.

**_Disposition of Foreign Currency_**

Foreign currency received as interest on a Note or on the sale or retirement of a Note will have a tax basis equal
to its U.S. dollar value at the time the foreign currency is received. Foreign currency that is purchased generally
will have a tax basis equal to the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency on the date of purchase. Any gain or

251


-----

loss recognized on a sale or other disposition of a foreign currency (including its use to purchase Notes or upon
exchange for U.S. dollars) will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss.

**_Backup Withholding and Information Reporting_**

Payments of principal and interest on the Notes, and the proceeds of a sale or retirement of Notes, by a U.S.
paying agent or other U.S. intermediary will be reported to the IRS and to the U.S. Holder as may be required
under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations. Backup withholding may apply to these payments if the U.S. Holder
fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number or certification of exempt status or fails to comply
with applicable certification requirements. Certain U.S. Holders are not subject to backup withholding. U.S.
Holders should consult their tax advisors about these rules and any other reporting obligations that may apply to
the ownership or disposition of Notes, including requirements related to the holding of certain foreign financial
assets.

**Certain Swedish tax considerations**

The following summary of certain tax considerations that may arise as a result of holding Notes is based on
current Swedish tax legislation and is intended only as general information for holders of Notes who are resident
in Sweden for tax purposes, unless otherwise indicated. This description does not deal comprehensively with all
tax consequences that may occur for holders of Notes and is neither intended to be nor should be construed as
legal or tax advice. For instance, it does not cover the specific rules where Notes are held by a partnership or as
current assets in a business operation. Moreover, the description does not address situations where Notes are held
in an investment savings account (Sw. _investeringssparkonto)_ or through an endowment insurance
(Sw. kapitalförsäkring). The summary does not address the rules regarding reporting obligations for, among
others, payers of interest. Special tax consequences that are not described below may also apply for certain
categories of taxpayers, including investment companies and mutual funds. Prospective purchasers of Notes
should consult their own tax advisers for information with respect to the special tax consequences that may arise
as a result of acquiring, holding and disposing of Notes, including the applicability and effect of foreign income
tax rules, provisions in double taxation treaties and other rules which may be applicable.

**_Taxation of individuals tax resident in Sweden_**

_Capital gains and losses. Individuals who sell their Notes, or have their Notes redeemed or bought back, are_
subject to capital gains tax. The tax rate is 30%.

The capital gain or loss is calculated as the difference between the sales (or redemption) proceeds, after
deduction of sales costs, and the Notes’ acquisition cost for tax purposes. The acquisition cost is determined
according to the “average method.” This means that the acquisition value for all Notes of the same class and type
shall be added together and computed collectively, with respect to changes to the holding.

Gains or losses on currency exchange rate fluctuations may arise in relation to Notes where the sales proceeds
received are in a foreign currency. However, no special calculations are required if the sales proceeds are
exchanged into SEK within 30 days from the time of disposal. In such case, the exchange rate on the date of
exchange shall be used when calculating the value of the sales proceeds. The exchange rate on the date of
acquisition is generally used when determining the acquisition cost for tax purposes.

As a general rule, 70% of a capital loss is deductible against any other taxable income from capital. However,
capital losses on listed Swedish receivables are fully deductible in the income from capital category. According
to Swedish case law, full deductibility also applies to capital losses on listed foreign receivables.

If a net loss arises in the income from capital category, a reduction of the tax on income from employment and
from business operations, as well as the tax on real estate and the municipal real estate fee, is allowed. The tax
reduction is 30% of any part of the net loss not exceeding SEK 100,000 and 21% of any part of the net loss in
excess of SEK 100,000. An excess net loss may not be carried forward to a subsequent fiscal year.

_Interest. Any interest income received by an individual Noteholder is subject to Swedish tax at a tax rate of 30%_
in the income from capital category. Interest income is taxable when the income can be disposed of.

_Withholding of tax on interest. The legal entity effecting an interest payment to an individual (or an estate of a_
deceased individual) will normally be required to withhold Swedish preliminary tax (Sw. preliminärskatt). The
preliminary tax withheld is normally equal to the final tax on the interest income, which means that there is
generally no further tax payable on the interest.

252


-----

**_Taxation of Swedish limited liability companies_**

For limited liability companies (Sw. aktiebolag), all income, including interest and capital gains on the Notes, is
taxed as income from business operations at a flat rate of 20.6% (the tax rate is 21.4% for fiscal years
commencing prior to January 1, 2021). Deductible capital losses on the Notes may normally be fully off-set
against income from business operations.

Interest income and currency exchange fluctuations are normally taxable, or deductible, as the case may be, on an
accrual basis.

Specific rules may apply to Notes held as a hedge for foreign currency exposure.

**_Taxation of holders of Notes that are not tax resident in Sweden_**

Payments of any principal amount or any amount that is considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes to a
Noteholder are not subject to Swedish income tax, provided that such a holder is not resident in Sweden for
Swedish tax purposes and provided that such a holder does not have a permanent establishment in Sweden to
which the Notes are effectively connected.

Under domestic tax rules, an individual is resident in Sweden for Swedish tax purposes if he/she (i) is domiciled
in Sweden; (ii) has permanently stayed in Sweden; or (iii) has been domiciled earlier in Sweden and, after having
moved abroad, continues to have an essential connection to Sweden. A limited liability company is generally
deemed to be resident in Sweden if it is incorporated in Sweden under Swedish corporate laws. A foreign
company is deemed to have a permanent establishment in Sweden in case it has a fixed place of business through
which the business of the company is wholly or partly carried on.

Swedish withholding tax, or Swedish tax deduction, is not imposed on payments of any principal amount or any
amount that is considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes to a non-resident holder of Notes.

Holders of Notes who are not resident in Sweden for Swedish tax purposes and who are not carrying on business
operations from a permanent establishment in Sweden to which the Notes are attributable are generally not liable
for Swedish capital gains taxation on the disposal of Notes. The holders of Notes may be subject to tax in their
country of residence.

**Certain Norwegian tax considerations**

The following summary of certain Norwegian tax considerations that may arise as a result of holding Notes is
intended only as general information for holders of Notes who are resident in Norway for tax purposes, unless
otherwise indicated. The following description is based on the Norwegian tax legislation currently in force and as
applied in Norway as of the date of this offering memorandum. Such laws, rules and regulations may be subject
to changes after this date, possibly on a retroactive basis.

This description does not deal comprehensively with all tax consequences that may occur for holders of Notes
and is neither intended to be nor should be construed as legal or tax advice. In particular, this summary does not
consider any specific facts or circumstances that may apply to a particular purchaser subject to special tax
regimes, such as banks, insurance companies or tax-exempt organizations.

The tax treatment of each Noteholder partly depends on the Noteholder’s specific situation, and the specific
instrument issued to the Holder. Prospective purchasers of Notes should consult their own tax advisers for
information with respect to the special tax consequences that may arise as a result of acquiring, holding and
disposing of Notes, including the applicability and effect of foreign income tax rules, provisions in double
taxation treaties and other rules which may be applicable.

The description below presumes that the Notes are considered and treated as multiple debt instruments
(Nw. mengdegjeldsbrev) for Norwegian tax purposes.

Please note that for the purpose of the summary below, a reference to a Norwegian or non-Norwegian Noteholder
or the issuer refers to the tax residency and not the nationality of the Noteholder or issuer.

253


-----

**_Taxation of Norwegian holders of Notes_**

_Interest. For both corporate and individual holders of Notes who are residents of Norway for tax purposes_
(“Norwegian Holders”) interest received on the Notes is taxable as “ordinary income” subject to tax at a flat tax
rate of 22%. For Norwegian Holders holding Notes issued with a discount (compared to the nominal value) such
discount will be taxed in the year of the realization of the Notes.

If the Notes are not listed on a regulated market within six months following issuance, Norwegian Holders who
are individuals will be subject to additional Norwegian taxes on the interest received at a flat tax rate of 22%.
The basis for the additional tax is equal to the interest accrued on the Notes reduced by the tax rate of 22% and
less a risk free interest rate (Nw. skjermingsfradrag). This amount is then multiplied with a factor of 1.44 in order
to find the taxable amount. The risk free interest rate is determined by the Norwegian Ministry of Finance based
on the interest rate published by Norges Bank on a bi-monthly basis.

Any interest received in foreign currency is converted to Norwegian kroner when calculating the taxable interest
income.

If certain requirements are met, Norwegian Holders may be entitled to a tax credit in Norwegian taxes for
withholding tax imposed on the interest in the jurisdiction where the issuer (being the debtor) is resident for tax
purposes.

_Capital gains and losses. Sale, disposal or other redemption of the Notes is treated as a realization of such Notes_
and will trigger a capital gain or loss for Norwegian Holders. Capital gains will be taxable as ordinary income for
both individual and corporate Norwegian Holders, subject to the flat tax rate of 22%. Losses will be deductible
from a Norwegian Holder’s ordinary income, which is taxed at the same rate.

Any capital gain or loss is calculated for each Note, and is computed as the difference between the amount
received by the Norwegian Holder on realization and the Norwegian Holder’s cost price of the Notes. The cost
price is equal to the price for which the Norwegian Holder acquired the Notes, including costs incurred in
connection with the acquisition and realization of the Notes.

Any gain received in foreign currency when realizing Notes is converted to Norwegian kroner when calculating
the taxable gain.

If the Norwegian Holder owns Notes acquired at different points in time, the Notes that were acquired first will
be regarded as the first to be disposed of, on a first-in first-out basis.

The Norwegian tax treatment of the exchange from Temporary Notes to Additional Notes is not free from doubt,
as there is no clear tax precedent regarding such transactions. If the exchange is considered a realization of the
Temporary Notes, this may result in a taxable gain / loss for Norwegian Holders. The taxable gain will then be
calculated based on the value of the Additional Notes received, including any interest and currency effects.
Please see the sections above regarding the tax implications connected to realization of Notes. Norwegian
Holders should consult their tax advisers regarding the Norwegian tax consequences of the exchange of
Temporary Notes to Additional Notes.

_Net wealth tax. Norwegian Holders that are individuals are subject to Norwegian net wealth taxation. The value_
of the Notes held by an individual Norwegian Holder at the end of each income year is included in the basis for
the computation of net wealth tax. Currently, the marginal net wealth tax rate is 0.85% of the value assessed. The
value for assessment purposes for listed Notes is the listed value as of January 1 in the year of assessment (in
other words, the year following the relevant income year). The tax value of unlisted Notes is equal to the
presumed market value of the Notes as of January 1 in the year of assessment.

Norwegian Holders which are limited liability companies and certain similar entities are not subject to net wealth
tax.

**_Taxation of Non-Norwegian Holders_**

_Interest. In general, payments of interest on Notes paid by a non-Norwegian issuer to holders of Notes who are_
not resident in Norway for tax purposes (“Non-Norwegian Holders”) are currently not subject to Norwegian
income or withholding tax. However, if the Notes are held by a Non-Norwegian Holder that is performing
business activities in Norway, and the Notes are effectively connected with such business activities in Norway,
interest received will be taxed in Norway at a rate of 22%.

254


-----

_Capital gains and losses. A Non-Norwegian Holder is not taxed in Norway on gains derived from the sale,_
disposal or other redemption of the Notes. Corresponding losses will generally not be tax deductible.

Such capital gains/losses may however be taxable/ tax deductible in Norway if the Non-Norwegian Holder is
performing a business activity in Norway and the Notes are effectively connected with such business activity.

_Net wealth tax. Non-Norwegian Holders are generally not subject to Norwegian net wealth tax. Non-Norwegian_
Holders who are individuals can, however, be taxable if the Notes are effectively connected to the conduct of
trade or business in Norway.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

The Issuer, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, and Nordea Bank Abp, as Initial Purchasers, have entered into a
purchase agreement dated on or around the date of this offering memorandum with respect to the Temporary
Notes (the “Purchase Agreement”).

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial
Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase from the Issuer, the entire principal amount of the
Temporary Notes.

The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to purchase
Temporary Notes from the Issuer, are several and not joint.

The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Temporary Notes for resale at the issue price that appears on
the cover of this offering memorandum for the Temporary Notes. After the initial Offering, the Initial Purchasers
may change the Offering’s price for the Temporary Notes and any other selling terms without notice. The Initial
Purchasers may offer and sell Temporary Notes in the United States through certain of their affiliates or through
United States registered broker dealers.

In the Purchase Agreement, we have agreed that:

Š the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the relevant Temporary Notes are
subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain opinions of counsel;

Š during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including the date that is 90 days
after such date, none of the Issuer, the Guarantors or any of their subsidiaries or other affiliates will offer,
sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt (including, without limitation, any debt securities,
loans or other debt instruments), issued or guaranteed by any of the Issuer or the Guarantors and having a
tenor of more than one year (other than the Additional Notes issued in exchange for the Temporary Notes);
and

Š the Issuer and the relevant Guarantors will indemnify the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates
against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and/or will contribute to payments
that the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may be required to make in respect of those
liabilities.

Š the Issuer has agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for their services in connection
with the Offering and to reimburse them for certain out-of-pocket expenses. Persons who purchase
Temporary Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in
accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the issue price set forth on
the cover page hereof. Certain affiliates of the Issuer may purchase a portion of the Temporary Notes in the
Offering.

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other
jurisdiction. In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has agreed that the Temporary Notes may not be
offered or sold within the United States except pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of
the Securities Act or in transactions not subject to those registration requirements, including sales pursuant to
Rule 144A and Regulation S.

In addition, until 40 days following the later of (i) the commencement of the Offering and (ii) the Issue Date, an
offer or sale of Temporary Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the
Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act unless the dealer makes the offer or sale
in compliance with Rule 144A or another exemption from registration under the Securities Act. During this
40-day period, neither Clearstream nor Euroclear will monitor compliance by dealers with the Securities Act.
Nordea Bank Abp’s ability to engage in U.S. securities dealings is limited under the U.S. Bank Holding
Company Act and it may not offer or sell securities that are offered or sold in the United States. Nordea Bank
Abp will only offer and sell the securities that are part of its allotment solely outside of the United States.

The Temporary Notes and the Additional Notes are each a new issue of securities, and there is currently no
established trading market for the Temporary Notes or the Additional Notes. In addition, the Temporary Notes
and the Additional Notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Transfer
_Restrictions.” We do not intend to apply for the Temporary Notes or the Additional Notes to be listed on any_
securities exchange other than the Official List of the Exchange or to arrange for the Temporary Notes or the

256


-----

Additional Notes to be quoted on any quotation system. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to
make a market in the Temporary Notes and the Additional Notes, but they are not obligated to do so. The Initial
Purchasers may discontinue any market making in the Temporary Notes and the Additional Notes at any time in
their sole discretion. In addition, such market making activities will be subject to the limits imposed by the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and other applicable legal requirements. Accordingly, we cannot assure you
that a liquid trading market will develop for the Temporary Notes or the Additional Notes, that you will be able
to sell your Notes at a particular time or that the prices that you receive when you sell will be favorable.

In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers may engage in overallotment, stabilizing transactions and
syndicate covering transactions. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the Offering size, which creates a
short position for the Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the Temporary Notes or
the Additional Notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the
Temporary Notes and the Additional Notes, as applicable. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of
the Temporary Notes or the Additional Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in
order to cover short positions. Stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions may cause the price of
the Temporary Notes or the Additional Notes, as applicable, to be higher than it would otherwise be in the
absence of those transactions. If the Initial Purchasers engage in stabilizing or syndicate covering transactions,
they may discontinue them at any time.

It is expected that delivery of the Temporary Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the date
specified on the cover page of this offering memorandum, which will be the ten business day following the date
of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+10”). Under Rule 15(c)6-1 of the
Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the
parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Temporary
Notes on the date of pricing or the next seven successive business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that
the Temporary Notes initially will settle in T+10, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any
such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Temporary Notes who wish to trade the Temporary
Notes on the date of pricing should consult their own advisor.

In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser, severally and not jointly, has represented and agreed that:

Š it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done
by it in relation to the Temporary Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom; and

Š it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of
Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Temporary Notes in
circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or the Guarantors.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by the Issuer
or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Temporary Notes or the Additional Notes or
the possession, circulation or distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating to us or the
Temporary Notes or the Additional Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required.
Accordingly, the Temporary Notes and the Additional Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly,
and neither this offering memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the
Temporary Notes or the Additional Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction,
except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This offering
memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where
such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum comes
are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of
this offering memorandum and resale of Temporary Notes or Additional Notes. See “Notice to Certain
_Investors.”_

Certain of the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates from time to time have performed, and in the future will
perform, banking, investment banking, advisory, consulting and other financial services for the Issuer and its
affiliates, for which they may receive customary advisory and transaction fees and reimbursement of expenses.
Each Initial Purchaser is also involved in the Super Senior Facilities and may also act as hedging counterparties.
In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make
or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities)
and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers.
Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates.

257


-----

Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with us routinely hedge their
credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Initial Purchasers
and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions that consist of either the purchase of
credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Temporary Notes
offered hereby and the Additional Notes. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of
the Temporary Notes offered hereby or the Additional Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also
make investment recommendations or publish or express independent research views in respect of the Issuer, the
Group, such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long or
short positions in such securities and instruments.

**CERTAIN INSOLVENCY CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND**
**ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS**

Set forth below is a summary of certain limitations on the enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the security
interests in some of the jurisdictions in which the Note Guarantees or the Collateral are being provided. It is a
summary only, and proceedings of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event could be initiated in any of these
jurisdictions and in the jurisdiction of organization of a future guarantor of the Additional Notes. The application
of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply
and could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights and collect payment in full under the Additional
Notes, the Note Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral. Also set forth below is a brief description
of certain aspects of insolvency law in Sweden and Norway.

**European Union**

The Guarantors in Sweden and Norway are organized under the European Economic Area.

Pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) no. 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings (the “EU Insolvency
Regulation”), which applies within the E.U., other than Denmark, the courts of the Member State in which a
company’s “center of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation,
“COMI”) is situated has jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings. The determination of where a
company has its COMI is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have
differing and even conflicting views.

Although there is a presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that a company has its
COMI in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary,
Preamble 13 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the COMI of a debtor should correspond to the place
where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and “is therefore ascertainable by
third parties.” The courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in determining the COMI of a
company, including, in particular, where board meetings are held, the location at which the company conducts
the majority of its business or has its head office and the location at which the majority of the company’s
creditors are established. A company’s COMI may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes
of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of
the insolvency petition.

The EU Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings that are collective insolvency proceedings of
the types referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation.

If the COMI of a company is in one Member State (other than Denmark) under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency
Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open territorial
insolvency proceedings against that company only if such company has an “establishment” in the territory of
such other Member State. An “establishment” is defined to mean a place of operations at which the company
carries on non-transitory economic activity with human means and goods. The effects of those insolvency
proceedings opened in that other Member State are restricted to the assets of the company situated in such other
Member State.

Where main proceedings have been opened in the Member State in which the company has its COMI, any
proceedings opened subsequently in another Member State in which the company has an establishment
(secondary proceedings) are limited to “winding-up proceedings” listed in Annex B of the EU Insolvency
Regulation. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the company has its COMI have not yet been
opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can only be opened in another Member State in which the company
has an establishment where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the Member State in which the
company’s COMI is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are
opened at the request of a creditor that is domiciled, habitually resident or has its registered office in the other
Member State or whose claim arises from the operation of the establishment.

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court opening main
proceedings which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no territorial proceedings
have been opened there. The liquidator appointed by a court in a Member State that has jurisdiction to open main
proceedings (because the company’s COMI is there) may exercise the powers conferred on him or her by the law
of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of the company from that other Member

259


-----

State) subject to certain limitations so long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other Member
State or any preservation measures taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in
that other Member State in which the company has assets.

Further to the above, according to the Nordic Bankruptcy Convention of 7 November 1933 (the “Nordic
Bankruptcy Convention”) a bankruptcy opened in Sweden, Norway or Finland comprises all assets and liabilities
that a bankruptcy debtor possesses also in any other of these countries, and the bankruptcy administrator is
authorized to dispose of all the assets of the bankruptcy, regardless of in which of such countries the assets are
located. Moreover, the Nordic Bankruptcy Convention stipulates that the law of the Nordic country in which the
insolvency proceedings are opened (lex concursus) is applicable unless any specific exception is stated in the
Nordic Bankruptcy Convention.

**Sweden**

**Applicable Insolvency Law**

Certain Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Sweden (each a “Swedish Obligor”). To the extent that
such companies have their center-of-main interests in Sweden, Swedish bankruptcy law is applicable, subject to
the provisions of the EU-Insolvency Regulation. As a starting point and by virtue of Article 4 of the EU
Insolvency Regulation, insolvency proceedings applicable to a Swedish Obligor may be governed by Swedish
insolvency law (lex fori concursus).

**Insolvency Proceedings**

Pursuant to chapter 1, section 2 of the Swedish Bankruptcy Act (Sw. konkurslagen (1987:672)), if a company is
unable to pay its debts when due and such inability is not merely temporary, it is deemed insolvent and can be
declared bankrupt following a bankruptcy petition filed with the court by (i) the debtor or (ii) by a creditor of the
debtor.

In the event of bankruptcy, the court will appoint a receiver (Sw. konkursförvaltare) in bankruptcy who will work
in the interest of all creditors with the objective of realizing the debtor’s assets and distribute the proceeds among
the creditors.

The purpose of bankruptcy proceedings is to wind up the company in such a way that the company’s creditors
receive as high a proportion of their claims as possible. The receiver in bankruptcy is required to safeguard the
assets and can decide to continue the business or to close it down, depending on what is best for all creditors. In
general, the receiver in bankruptcy is required to sell the assets of the debtor as soon as possible and to distribute
the proceeds. In the interim, the receiver will take over the management and control of the company and the
company’s directors and/or managing director will no longer be entitled to represent the company or dispose of
the company’s assets.

When distributing the proceeds, the receiver must follow the mandatory provisions of the Swedish Rights of
Priority Act (Sw. förmånsrättslagen (1970:979)), as amended from time to time, that states the order in which
creditors have a right to be paid. As a general principle, in bankruptcy proceedings competing claims have equal
right to payment in relation to the size of the amount claimed from the debtor’s assets.

In case of enforcement outside of bankruptcy proceedings in respect of certain types of assets, such as over
shares, receivables, bank accounts, trademarks and contractual rights, enforcement can be carried out by the
security holder itself. A provision granting the secured party or its agent such right of enforcement is typically
included in any pledge agreement between the pledgor and the secured party or its agent. The secured party is
typically entitled to enforce the security through a sale of the collateral. However, certain restrictions apply to the
procedure for such a sale. In general, when enforcing the security, the secured party is under a duty of care in
relation to the security provider and the security granted. The security provider should, if the circumstances are
not exceptional, be given prior notice of the contemplated enforcement and also of the time and location of the
sale. Furthermore, sufficient notice should be given to prospective purchasers in order to create reasonable
preconditions for a market price being obtained in the sale. Where the secured party has been granted the right to
enforce the security through a private sale, such sale must be made to a party unaffiliated with the secured party
unless the market price of the security can be independently and objectively established and the security is sold at
such price. Pledges over receivables and other claims are, if the receivable or claim has fallen due, normally
enforced through the secured party collecting the payment as opposed to selling the receivable.

260


-----

Enforcement of security in bankruptcy is also subject to certain restrictions. A secured party holding a possessory
pledge over movable property (such as shares) may arrange for the sale of the movable property at a public
auction. Such secured party must however give the receiver in bankruptcy an opportunity to arrange payment of
the debtor’s debt to the creditor in order to redeem the movable property to the bankruptcy estate, and the
movable property may not, without the consent of the receiver in bankruptcy, be sold earlier than four weeks
after the oath administration meeting (Sw. edgångssammanträde) held as a part of the bankruptcy proceedings.
However, financial instruments, currency and, under certain circumstances, gold, are exempt from this
requirement. The secured party may either sell such financial instruments, currency or gold immediately or
assume ownership (against reduction of the secured debt with the market value of such assets or, if the market
value of the assets exceeds the outstanding debt, against repayment to the debtor of the surplus), provided that the
realization is done in a commercially viable manner. Should the security granted consist of rights over unlisted
shares in a subsidiary of the debtor, the receiver in bankruptcy must still be given an opportunity to redeem the
shares prior to the sale or deduction.

**Priority of Certain Creditors**

In general, proceeds are distributed in the following order:

(a) fees to the receiver;

(b) debts of the estate (Sw. massaskuld);

(c) specific preferential rights;

(d) general preferential rights;

(e) non-prioritized debts; and

(f) subordinated debts.

Fixed charges (in specified assets) are generally prioritized in order of establishment and fixed charges are
generally prioritized to floating charges. Debts with the same priority will be paid in relation to relative size.

**Limitations on the Value of a Guarantee**

A Swedish limited liability company may not provide a guarantee for the obligations of a parent or sister
company, unless they belong to the same group of companies and the Parent of that group is domiciled within the
European Economic Area (EEA). Furthermore, if a Swedish limited liability company provides any guarantee
without receiving sufficient corporate benefit in return, such guarantee will, in whole or in part, be considered a
distribution of assets, which will be lawful only to the extent (i) there is sufficient coverage for the unrestricted
equity capital of the Swedish limited liability company after the distribution (in other words, at the time the
guarantee is provided) (where the aggregate amount available for distribution during the period from the annual
general meeting until the following year’s annual general meeting shall be calculated on the basis of the balance
sheet approved by the shareholders at the first annual general meeting, taking into account changes in the
restricted equity capital after such annual general meeting) and (ii) if it is considered prudent by a Swedish
Obligor to undertake the value transfer after having taken into consideration the equity requirements imposed by
the nature, scope and risks relating to its business or such Swedish Obligor’s need to strengthen its balance sheet,
liquidity or financial position. Where the Swedish limited liability company is a parent company, the latter
assessment is also made on a group level. It should also be noted that laws relating to financial assistance in
Sweden prohibit limited liability companies incorporated in Sweden from providing guarantees or other credit
support for obligations of any person where such obligations are being incurred for the purpose of acquiring
shares in the company itself or any of its group companies (with the exception of its subsidiaries). The guarantees
of and security interests granted by a Swedish Obligor are limited in accordance with the above restrictions
relating to corporate benefit and are subject to limitation language limiting the liability of such entities
thereunder if required by the above restrictions relating to financial assistance and in accordance with the above
restrictions relating to corporate benefit.

**Limitations on the Validity of Certain Transactions**

In bankruptcy and company reorganization proceedings, transactions can (in certain circumstances and subject to
a time limit) be reversed and the goods or money can then be returned to the bankruptcy estate or the company
subject to company reorganization. Broadly, these transactions include, among others, situations where the
debtor has conveyed property fraudulently or preferentially to one creditor to the detriment of its other creditors

261


-----

before the initiation of the relevant insolvency proceedings, granting a Guarantee that was either not stipulated at
the time when the obligation arose or not perfected without delay after such time and the delay is not considered
to be ordinary, or paid a debt that is not due or that is considerable compared to the value of the debtor’s assets or
if the payment is made by using unusual means of payment. In the majority of situations, a claim for recovery
can be made concerning actions that were made during the three months preceding the commencement of the
relevant insolvency proceedings. In certain situations, longer time limits apply and in others there are no time
limits. These include, among others, situations where the other party to an agreement or other arrangement is
deemed to be a closely related party to the debtor such as a subsidiary or Parent.

**Limitations on Enforceability due to the Swedish Reorganization Act**

The Swedish Reorganization Act (Sw. lagen (1996:764) om företagsrekonstruktion) provides companies facing
difficulties in meeting their payment obligations with an opportunity to resolve these without being declared
bankrupt. A petition for company reorganization may be presented by (i) the debtor or (ii) a creditor of the
debtor. Corporate reorganization proceedings shall, as a main rule, terminate within three months from
commencement but may under certain conditions be extended for up to one year.

An administrator (Sw. rekonstruktör) is appointed by the court and supervises the day-to-day activities and
safeguards the interests of creditors as well as the debtor. However, the debtor remains in full possession of the
business except that, for important decisions such as paying a debt that has fallen due prior to the order of
reorganization, granting security for a debt that arose prior to the order, undertaking new obligations or
transferring, pledging or granting rights in respect of assets of a substantial value for the business, the consent of
the administrator is required. However, the absence of such consent does not affect the validity of the transaction
(but may jeopardize the reorganization).

Upon the opening of corporate reorganization proceedings, the administrator must notify the creditors of the
reorganization proceedings and will draw up a reorganization plan specifying the proposed action to be taken to
resolve the company’s difficulties. A creditors’ meeting will be held at which the creditors will be given the
opportunity to express their opinions as to whether the reorganization should continue. Upon the request of any
of the creditors, the court shall appoint a creditors’ committee composed of a maximum of three persons. The
administrator shall, if possible, consult with the creditors’ committee prior to taking any important decisions.

The making of an order under the Swedish Reorganization Act does not have the effect of terminating contracts
with the debtor and, during the reorganization procedure, the debtor’s business activities continue in the ordinary
course of business. However, the procedure includes a suspension of payments to creditors and the debtor cannot
pay a debt that fell due prior to the order without the consent of the administrator and such consent may only be
granted should there be exceptional reasons for doing so and any petition for bankruptcy in respect of the debtor
will be stayed. A moratorium also applies to execution in respect of a claim or enforcement of security during
corporate reorganization proceedings unless the security assets are in the physical possession of the secured
creditor or any agent acting on behalf of such creditor, which is the case with a Swedish law pledge over the
shares in a Swedish limited liability company where the share certificates of such company has been delivered to
the agent.

The debtor may apply to the court requesting public composition proceedings (Sw. offentligt ackord) which
means that the amount of a creditor’s claim may be reduced on a percentage basis. The proposal for a public
composition must meet certain requirements such as (i) that a sufficient proportion of the creditors which are
allowed to vote and (ii) that such creditors represent a sufficient proportion of the total outstanding claims, vote
in favor of such public composition proposal. Creditors with set-off rights and secured creditors will not
participate in the composition unless they wholly or partly waive their set-off rights or priority rights. Should the
security not cover a secured creditor’s full claim, the remaining claim will, however, be part of a composition.
A creditors’ meeting is convened to vote on the proposed composition. The public composition is binding on all
creditors that were entitled to participate, meaning that creditors who have not attended the creditors’ meeting
will also be bound. However, the obligations of a guarantor under a guarantee provided in respect of a creditor’s
claim which has been reduced by way of public composition will not be reduced correspondingly but will remain
valid up to the original amount of such creditor’s claim.

**Effect of Bankruptcy on the Bankruptcy Debtor’s Contracts**

The declaration of bankruptcy does not automatically terminate existing contracts and instead the receiver may in
its discretion choose to have the bankruptcy estate itself become party to any such existing contracts. If the estate

262


-----

enters into the contract and performance by the creditor is due, the creditor may demand that the estate performs
its obligations as well or, if a grace period has been granted, request that the estate, without unreasonable delay,
provides acceptable security for its performance. If performance by the creditor is not due, the creditor may
request security where this is necessary in order to protect against loss. If the estate does not enter into the
contract within a reasonable time after the creditor’s demand or if it does not comply with the creditor’s request
to provide security, the creditor may terminate the contract.

**Limitations due to capital deficiency**

Pursuant to the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. aktiebolagslag (2005:551)), as amended (the “Swedish Companies
Act”), whenever a company’s board of directors has a reason to assume that, as a result of losses or reductions in
the value of the company’s assets or any other event, the company’s equity is less than half the registered share
capital, the company’s board of directors shall prepare a special balance sheet (Sw. kontrollbalansräkning) and
have the auditors examine it. The same obligation arises if the company in connection with enforcement pursuant
to Chapter 4 of the Swedish Enforcement Code (Sw. utsökningsbalken (1981:774)) is found to lack sizeable
assets.

If the special balance sheet shows that the equity of the company is less than half of the registered share capital,
the board of directors shall, as soon as possible, issue a notice to call a shareholders’ meeting which shall
consider whether the company shall go into liquidation (initial shareholders’ meeting). The special balance sheet
and an auditor’s report with respect thereto shall be presented at the initial shareholders’ meeting.

If the special balance sheet presented at the initial shareholders’ meeting fails to show that, on the date of such
meeting, the equity of the company amounts to the registered share capital and the initial shareholders’ meeting
has not resolved that the company shall go into liquidation, the shareholders’ meeting shall, within eight months
of the initial shareholders’ meeting, reconsider the issue of whether the company shall go into liquidation (second
shareholders’ meeting). Prior to the second shareholders’ meeting, the board of directors shall prepare a new
special balance sheet and cause such to be reviewed by the company’s auditors. The new special balance sheet
and an auditor’s report thereon shall be presented at the second shareholders’ meeting.

A shareholders’ resolution on liquidation of the company shall be registered with the Swedish Companies
Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket), which shall appoint a liquidator. Should the shareholders not resolve on
such voluntary liquidation where required (which is where (i) a second shareholders’ meeting is not held within
the period of time stated above, or (ii) the new special balance sheet which was presented at the second
shareholders’ meeting was not reviewed by the company’s auditor or fails to show that, on the date of such
meeting, the equity of the company amounts to at least the registered share capital), the court may put the
company into compulsory liquidation and appoint a liquidator. The liquidator takes over management and control
of the company and shall sell the company’s assets and settle the company’s debts with the proceeds. The
liquidator shall give notice to the company’s unknown creditors and creditors that have not lodged their claims
with the liquidator within six months following such notice will have forfeited their rights to their claims.

**Foreign Currency**

Swedish courts may award judgments in currencies other than Swedish kronor, but the judgment debtor has the
right to pay the judgment debt, even though denominated in a foreign currency, in Swedish kronor at the rate of
exchange prevailing at the date of payment.

**Norway**

**Limitations on Guarantees and security interests**

The obligations of a Guarantor incorporated in Norway (each a “Norwegian Obligor”) under a Guarantee or in
connection with any security interest provided under any security documents, will be limited by such mandatory
provisions of law applicable to that Norwegian Obligor limiting the legal capacity or ability of the Norwegian
Obligor to grant or honor a guarantee as provided for in this offering memorandum, including, but not limited to,
the provisions of Sections 8-7 and 8-10 of the Norwegian Private Limited Liability Companies Acts of 13 June
1997 no. 44 (No. aksjeloven) and the Norwegian Public Limited Liability Companies Acts of 13 June 1997
no. 45 (No. allmennaksjeloven) (together, the “Norwegian Companies Acts”).

Section 8-7 of the Norwegian Companies Acts restricts a Norwegian limited liability company from granting
credit to, guaranteeing or providing security for the obligations of, its (direct and indirect) shareholders (or any

263


-----

affiliates of its shareholders) beyond its distributable reserves (free equity) and then, only if adequate security is
provided in favor of the company’s repayment/recourse claim against that shareholder or affiliate. Whether the
provision of credit, guarantee or security is in compliance with the Norwegian Companies Acts has to be
determined at the time such credit, guarantee or security is provided.

The above restrictions in Section 8-7 of the Norwegian Companies Acts are, however, subject to exceptions and
pursuant to such exception the restrictions does not apply to any credit, guarantee or security for the obligations
of (i) its direct or indirect Norwegian parent company and its Norwegian and foreign subsidiaries, provided that
the parent company is a Norwegian limited liability company or (ii) its direct or indirect foreign parent company
and its Norwegian and foreign subsidiaries, provided that the parent company has decisive influence over the
company (meaning, it typically owns more than 50% of the shares in the company) and that the credit, guarantee
or security has been made in the “financial interest of the group.” This exception is fairly new, and how it shall
be interpreted and practiced is therefore still somewhat uncertain. However, the general perception in Norway
seems to be that the term “the group’s financial interests” covers quite a wide range of transactions, but that for
instance transactions whose main purpose is to benefit the shareholders of the parent company and not the group
(such as dividend recap-transactions and the like), will not be covered by this exception. Pursuant to the
preparatory works of the Norwegian Companies Acts, this condition will not be satisfied if funds from a
Norwegian Obligor are being utilized to the benefit of the group’s ultimate shareholders (for example, financing
distributions to the owners).

In addition to the restrictions with respect to upstream and cross-stream loans, guarantees and security outlined
above, Section 8-10 of the Norwegian Companies Acts restricts a Norwegian limited liability company from
granting any financial assistance (in other words, making assets available, granting credit or providing guarantees
or security) in connection with the acquisition of shares in itself or its direct or indirect parent company, and
these restrictions apply irrespective of whether the company whose shares are being acquired is a Norwegian or a
foreign company. In order for such financial assistance to be valid and binding, the financial exposure of the
Norwegian company cannot exceed the amount which the company has available for distribution of dividends to
its shareholders (free equity), and the financial assistance must also be granted according to “ordinary
commercial terms and principles.”

Following certain amendments to the Norwegian Companies Acts that were introduced on January 1, 2020, the
limitation of financial assistance to the amount of the Norwegian company’s free equity does not apply for
Norwegian private limited liability companies if (i) the acquirer of the shares is domiciled in the European
Economic Area and (ii) the Norwegian company is, or will following the acquisition, form part of the same group
as the acquirer (in other words, be controlled by the acquirer following the acquisition).

In addition, Section 8-10 provides that for a Norwegian company to grant financial assistance its board of
directors must issue a report (Nw. redegjørelse) where it makes an assessment of the creditworthiness of the
beneficiary of the financial assistance (meaning, the acquirer), and also gives an account of the background and
the terms of the financial assistance in question. The board report must also include a declaration to the effect
that (1) it will be in the interest of the company to grant the financial assistance, and (2) that the company will
have sufficient equity and liquidity as required by the Norwegian Companies Acts when taking the financial
assistance into account. Further, the report must address the requirement of the financial assistance being granted
on ordinary commercial terms, typically by way of the target company receiving some kind of consideration for
providing the financial support (for example, guarantee commission or similar from the acquirer). The financial
assistance must thereafter be approved by a majority representing at least two-thirds of both the votes and share
capital represented at the general meeting of shareholders of the Norwegian company. Finally, the minutes of the
general meeting and the board report need to be filed with the Norwegian Business Register
(Nw. Foretaksregisteret) before the financial assistance can be provided.

The Norwegian Companies Acts restricts financial assistance made “in connection with” the acquisition of
shares, which may also cover financial assistance after completion of the acquisition (such as the refinancing of
an acquisition loan facility or the subsequent merger of the target company and the acquiring entity). There must,
however, be sufficient connection both in time and as regards other circumstances surrounding such assistance
for it to be in contravention of Section 8-10.

Section 8-10 explicitly states that the restrictions on financial assistance does not apply to other distributions
made in accordance with the Norwegian Companies Acts, such as distributions by way of dividends, group
contributions or share capital reductions.

264


-----

The issue of corporate benefit may in some situations impose a restriction on a Norwegian limited liability
company’s possibility to offer a guarantee and/or provide security to shareholders in addition to the restrictions
described above. Norwegian law does not have a “clear and well-defined” corporate benefit principle (stating that
transactions that do not sufficiently coincide with the interest or are to the benefit of the company may be
challenged), as you find in many other jurisdictions. Having said that, there are several provisions in the
Norwegian Companies Acts, whose main purpose are to ensure that shareholders and other related parties, board
members, creditors etc., do not get what may be considered an unreasonable benefit at the expense of the
Norwegian company (normally referred to as “abuse of lawful authority”) and/or secure maximum profits/return
for the company and its shareholders.

Financial assistance, guarantees or security infringing the limitations set out in Sections 8-7 and Section 8-10 of
the Norwegian Companies Acts may be declared void if challenged and may give rise to directors’ liability
issues. If a credit, guarantee or security is provided in contravention of these rules, any funds paid out will have
to be repaid to the company. Typically, the financial assistance restrictions set out in Sections 8-7 and 8-10 are
dealt with by including so-called “limitation language” in the relevant finance documents (to the effect that the
Norwegian limited liability company only guarantees and secures the relevant obligations to the extent the same
would not be in breach of those restrictions).

**Creation and enforcement of security**

Norwegian law strictly requires written statutory basis for establishing a security interest. Although it is not
possible for a Norwegian company to provide a fixed or floating charge over all its present and future assets,
Norwegian law provides for effectively creating security over a range of closely defined asset types. For
example, floating charges may be established over certain asset types of a Norwegian company.

As a main rule, a secured creditor does not have a general step-in right to security assets in an enforcement
situation and agreements on enforcement cannot validly be entered into prior to the occurrence of an event of
default. Instead, enforcement must be sought through the Norwegian courts and/or the Norwegian enforcement
authorities. However, this is different for financial instruments, such as shares in a Norwegian limited liability
company. If the secured party is a financial institution or bond trustee, the shares are considered financial
collateral, and the parties are free (within reasonable limits) to agree on the enforcement process in the share
pledge agreement.

Also, for specific security assets, and under certain circumstances, a creditor may take possession or directly
enforce its rights upon enforcement. This is the case for security established over receivables (such as trade
receivables or bank account claims) whereby the secured party may instruct the relevant debtor to pay the
outstanding amounts directly to the secured party instead of to the chargor.

The concept of a security trustee, as it is understood under common law, does not exist under Norwegian law. In
practice, in an arrangement with a security agent acting on behalf of the secured parties, as these exist from time
to time, it is generally recognized under Norwegian law that the security agent will be able to enforce the security
on behalf of the secured parties and apply any proceeds to the secured parties. In order to commence any legal
action regarding a claim (for enforcement purposes or otherwise) against the debtor the security agent may,
however, be required to disclose to the court the identity of the creditors and have the creditors join in or
participate as claimants in the proceedings. It has been established by the Norwegian Supreme Court that a bond
trustee for an undisclosed number of bondholders can, based on the provisions in the bond agreement, take legal
action against the issuer on behalf of and in lieu of the bondholders and without having to disclose the entity of
the bondholders.

**Insolvency—Bankruptcy**

Norwegian insolvency legislation is contained in the Norwegian Bankruptcy Act of June 8, 1984 no. 58 (the
“Norwegian Bankruptcy Act”), which sets out the various procedures to be followed, and the Creditors Recovery
Act of June 8, 1984 no. 59 (the “Norwegian Recovery Act”) containing inter alia provisions regulating priority
of claims and revocation of certain pre-liquidation transactions.

Norwegian insolvency legislation (save for the provisional Norwegian Reconstruction Act described below)
prioritize the timely recovery and realization of underlying assets, rather than the rescue of the company/debtor
as such, and generally follow internationally recognized standards with: (i) a seizure and subsequent disposal of
debtor’s assets, (ii) assessment and ranking of claims, (iii) testing and revocation of transactions made prior to
bankruptcy, and (iv) continued operation of the company at the risk of, and (in practice) only if guaranteed by,
creditors.

265


-----

Norwegian bankruptcy proceedings are opened following a petition from a creditor or the debtor itself to the
local court where the debtor has its headquarters. The court will request a cash deposit of NOK 58,600 (as of
2020) from the petitioning creditor (does not apply to the debtor or employee-initiated bankruptcy) to secure
court fees and basic costs related to the proceedings.

The court reviews whether the procedural and material requirements for opening the procedures are fulfilled. A
petition from a creditor will be served on the debtor, and a court hearing will take place within two or three
weeks after the petition has been filed with the court. The court will, pre-judicially, review any objections the
debtor might have to the petition (for example, whether the creditor holds a valid claim or the debtor’s possible
counterclaim, among others). The creditor has to prove by a high degree of probability both (i) that the creditor
holds valid claim that is due for payment and (ii) that the debtor is insolvent.

There are two requirements for a debtor to be deemed to be insolvent. The debtor must (i) be unable to service its
debt as it becomes due, such payment difficulties not being of a temporary nature and (ii) the debtor must be in
deficit (the company’s debts must exceed the sum of its assets and revenue, based on real, not book, values).

The bankrupt company will be controlled by the court appointed liquidator (generally a lawyer). The liquidator is
often assisted and supervised by a creditors’ committee, also appointed by the court. A liquidator would be in
control of the company’s property following insolvency and the liquidator will generally adhere to the wishes of
the secured creditor as the liquidator’s main purpose is to dispose of the property.

The general task of the liquidator is to turn all assets into cash in the manner assumed to be most profitable for
the estate (the creditors) and then distribute the available cash to the creditors. All the company’s assets will in
practice be seized and the debtor may not dispose of the seized assets in any way while the bankruptcy
proceedings are ongoing.

The liquidator can decide that the business will continue to trade only if this is regarded as being in the best
interest of the estate as such. New debt incurred by the estate will be regarded as preferential debts. The
liquidator will therefore normally seek to obtain guarantees from creditors in favor of the estate (to cover debts to
suppliers, etc.).

Secured creditors are, in principle, not deemed to be part of the bankruptcy proceedings to the extent the value of
the security is sufficient to cover the underlying obligations of the debtor. The secured creditors may, in
principle, realize the security, and cover their claims, however, keeping in mind that the realization of a number
of categories of security during the first six months after the opening of a bankruptcy will be subject to the
approval of the bankruptcy estate (the same principles apply to official debt negotiations). The bankruptcy estate
has the right, subject to certain conditions being fulfilled, to realize the security with a wiping out effect on
unmet liens and divide the proceeds between the secured creditors and other holding legal rights in the assets.

Furthermore, the bankruptcy estate has a statutory first lien of up to 5% of the estimated value or sales value of
all assets (except financial collateral) secured by the debtor for its own debt or by a third-party for the debtor’s
indebtedness.

In Norwegian bankruptcies, the creditors will be paid according to the following priority:

(i) secured claims (are covered to the extent of the value of the secured asset; any remaining balance is
“transferred” to “ordinary claims”);

(ii) claims which arise during the bankruptcy proceedings, liquidators’ costs, obligations of the estate;

(iii) salary claims (within certain limitations);

(iv) tax claims (for example, withholding tax and VAT within certain limitations);

(v) ordinary claims (pari passu: unsecured debt, trade creditors, indemnity claims etc.); and

(vi) subordinated debt.

Pursuant to the Norwegian Recovery Act, the bankruptcy estate may be entitled to set aside or reverse
transactions carried out in the three to twelve-month period (and, in respect of transactions in favor of related
parties, up to two years) before the opening of the bankruptcy, such as extraordinary payments of certain
creditors, security established for existing debt and transactions at an under-value. The bankruptcy estate may
also, under certain circumstances, be entitled to set aside or reverse transactions made in bad faith or negligently

266

which in an improper manner increase the debtor’s debt, favor one or more creditors at the expense of others or
deprive the debtor of assets which may otherwise have served to cover the creditors’ claims, in which case the
time limit for challenges by the estate is increased to 10 years.

**Insolvency—Reconstruction**

The provisional Norwegian Provisional Reconstruction Act of May 7, 2020 No. 38 (the “Norwegian
Reconstruction Act”) relates to restructuring to alleviate financial difficulties resulting from the COVID-19
outbreak. Reconstruction is a law regulated “instrument” by which the debtor may seek bankruptcy protection
and protection from debt recovery proceedings, with the aim to reorganize the business and reach a composition
agreement with the creditors. The reconstruction proceedings are regulated by the Norwegian Reconstruction
Act, replacing, subject to certain exceptions, Part I of the Norwegian Bankruptcy Act for as long as the
Reconstruction Act remains in effect.

Reconstruction proceedings may be initiated by the courts after petition from the debtor or, on certain conditions,
from creditors (but may not be instituted against the will of the debtor).

In order for the courts to open reconstruction proceedings, the debtor must be encountering, or will in the
foreseeable future encounter, severe financial difficulties.

If the petition is granted, the Court shall appoint a reconstructor (who shall be an insolvency lawyer) and a
creditors committee (the “Reconstruction Committee”).

The key feature of the reconstruction proceedings is that all creditor collection steps are suspended, in particular:

Š Payment of all pre-petition debt is suspended

Š The debtor is protected from creditor initiated bankruptcy and debt recovery and enforcement proceedings
while the debtor’s business is being reconstructed

Š The debtor’s business is under the supervision of the Reconstruction Committee

The aim of the proceedings is in essence a reconstruction of the debtor’s business and to reduce the risk of
unnecessary bankruptcy of viable businesses.

The Reconstruction Act distinguishes between voluntary composition and compulsory composition. A voluntary
composition may in principle include any possible arrangement or composition. However, it requires an approval
from each and every one of the creditors, and is only binding on those creditors who have participated in the
composition (for example, not on “unknown” creditors). In a compulsory reconstruction, there are limitations
with respect to the contents of the proposal. It is however binding on the minority of creditors, and also on
unknown creditors.

Pursuant to the Reconstruction Act a voluntarily reconstruction may include (and a compulsory composition can
only include) a:

(i) moratorium;

(ii) percentage reduction of the debt;

(iii) full or partial conversion of debt to equity (only applicable to consenting creditors);

(iv) transfer of all or parts of the debtor’s business and assets, without liquidation;

(v) transfer and liquidation of all or parts of the debtor’s business and assets, discharging the debtor of the
obligations not covered by the liquidation; or

(vi) a combination of the above mentioned measures.

The proposed composition, together with the recommendation from the Reconstruction Committee, is distributed
to all creditors included in the composition, and the creditors are requested to confirm to the Reconstruction
Committee whether or not the proposed composition is accepted.

The creditors must accept or reject the composition within a time limit of minimum two, and maximum three
weeks.

267


-----

The voluntary composition is considered approved when it has been accepted by all the creditors included in the
composition. A compulsory composition is considered approved when it has been accepted by [1]⁄2 of the voting
creditors.

If the proposed composition is rejected by any of the creditors, the proposal may be subject to negotiations and
amended. The new proposal may be distributed to the creditors, always provided that the Reconstruction
Committee considers that the amended debt composition is likely to be obtained. If the amended proposal is
rejected, no further proposals may be distributed.

The only claims which may be excluded from the debt composition are preferential claims, secured claims, valid
counterclaims, and claims below a defined threshold set out in the proposed composition.

**Solvent enforcement**

Enforcement of security normally requires that the secured party files an application to the enforcement
authorities for the enforcement of the security. Certain types of security may, however, be enforced without the
involvement of the enforcement authority or a court, typically security established pursuant to the Financial
Collateral Act of March 26, 2004 no. 17 and charges over monetary claims. A provision granting the secured
party such right of enforcement is typically included in any security agreement between the pledgor/chargor and
the secured party.

Enforcement of a guarantee claim against a solvent guarantor will in principal require a final, legally binding
judgment by a court (unless the guarantee is made as an enforceable promissory note). Thereafter the creditor
may apply to the enforcement authorities for enforcement of his or her claim.

**Finland**

**Applicable Insolvency Law**

The Finnish target company Assemblin Oy is incorporated and has its centre of main interests in Finland. In the
event of insolvency of a Finnish company, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Finland. Such proceedings
would be governed by Finnish law. In case insolvency proceedings are connected to another EU member state
within the meaning of regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council on Insolvency
Proceedings, and provided that said regulation is applied to such EU member state, the regulation shall apply.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the Finnish insolvency law.

The provisions of the Finnish Bankruptcy Act (FI: Konkurssilaki, 120/2004, as amended, “Bankruptcy Act”), the
Finnish Restructuring of Enterprises Act (FI: Laki yrityksen saneerauksesta, 47/1993, as amended,
“Restructuring Act”) and the Finnish Act on the Recovery of Assets to the Bankruptcy Estate (FI: Laki
takaisinsaannista konkurssipesään 758/1991, as amended, “Recovery Act”) are particularly relevant to this
discussion.

Under Finnish law, if there is an imminent risk of a company becoming insolvent or the company is already
insolvent but it is probable that a company restructuring would remedy the company’s insolvency, the company
may be placed in a company restructuring (FI: yrityssaneeraus). Alternatively, if a company is insolvent, the
company may be subjected to bankruptcy proceedings (FI: konkurssi).

In addition to company restructuring and bankruptcy, a Finnish limited liability company may also be subject to
liquidation (FI: selvitystila) under the Finnish Companies Act (FI: Osakeyhtiölaki, 624/2006, as amended).
However, liquidation proceedings are voluntary and are used in practice to dissolve the company following a
bankruptcy or to dissolve a solvent company. In cases where a solvent company is subject to liquidation, there is
an obligation to conclude liquidation proceedings and file for bankruptcy if the company’s known debts cannot
be fully settled in liquidation. Thus, considerations regarding liquidation proceedings are not addressed in the
following.

**Company Restructuring**

If a company is insolvent or there is an imminent risk of the company becoming insolvent, and it is probable that
company restructuring proceedings would remedy the insolvency or prevent its recurrence otherwise than

268


-----

temporarily, an application for company restructuring can be filed with a court by the debtor or by one or more
creditors in accordance with the Restructuring Act. Furthermore, the initiation of company restructuring
proceedings is possible also without analysis of the debtor company’s solvency situation, when at least two
creditors whose total claims represent at least one-fifth of the debtor’s known debts and who are not related to the
debtor file a joint application with the debtor or declare that they support the debtor’s application for company
restructuring.

If there are no specific barriers to restructuring under the Restructuring Act and, consequently, the court approves
the application and commences restructuring proceedings, the court will simultaneously appoint a restructuring
administrator (FI: selvittäjä). The purpose of restructuring proceedings is to investigate whether the debtor’s
business has a reasonable chance to continue profitably and, if so, to rehabilitate the company’s viable business,
ensure its continued viability and make debt arrangements with creditors and execute other restructuring
measures. The Board of Directors and the Managing Director continue to act on behalf of the company during the
restructuring proceedings. The restructuring administrator’s right to receive information of the debtor company’s
business is extensive. The administrator is entitled to review the debtor company’s books and business
documents and obtain any information on the company’s business activities, as well as to participate in meetings
of the debtor’s corporate bodies. The restructuring administrator’s consent is required to certain legal acts of a
significant nature of the debtor company specified in the Restructuring Act.

The commencement of restructuring proceedings, as a general rule, has no effect on the debtor’s existing
contracts. However, there are some exceptions set forth in the Restructuring Act regarding premature termination
of certain contracts, such as lease agreements, unfulfilled contracts not deemed to be a regular part of the
activities of the debtor and employment relationships.

**_Moratorium_**

Subject to certain exceptions, all existing claims against the debtor company that have arisen before the filing of
the restructuring application are suspended as of the commencement of the company restructuring. The
commencement of the proceedings as a main rule results in several interdictions regarding restructuring debt
(meaning, debt that has arisen before the filing of the application), including a prohibition of repayment and debt
collection measures including enforcement of security provided by the debtor company on restructuring debt, and
precautionary measures (although debts arising after the filing of the restructuring application must be repaid and
can be enforced—please see below), such as the seizure of assets and prohibition of placing of security. The
court may order, on the request of the applicant or the debtor, that such interdictions are in effect on an interim
basis as of a date prior to the commencement of restructuring proceedings (in other words, shortly after the filing
of the application for the restructuring proceedings). The interdictions are in force until the restructuring program
has been affirmed by the district court or the proceedings have been, for reasons specified in the Restructuring
Act, dismissed or interrupted. Debts arising on the date when the restructuring application has been filed and
thereafter are not, as a general rule, considered restructuring debt and must be repaid as they become due. The
same applies to fees, charges and other running expenses (for example, lease payments) based on a continuous
contractual relationship or on a continuous contract regarding the use or possession of assets, to the extent as
these relate to the period subsequent to the filing of the application.

**_Debt Arrangements_**

Creditors with equal ranking receivables have an equal status in the arrangements of the restructuring debts
within the restructuring program.

Subject to certain restrictions set forth in the Restructuring Act, the following measures may be taken with
respect to unsecured debts in the restructuring program: (i) changing the repayment schedule; (ii) ordering that
debt payments be considered as payments against principal first, and as payments of interest and other credit
costs only after the repayment of the principal; (iii) reducing the obligation to pay interest and other credit costs
with respect to the remaining term of a debt; and (iv) reducing the outstanding principal balance of unpaid debt.
The restructuring program may also include the full or partial refinancing of debt, either as a lump sum funded by
the issuance of new debt or with payments in lieu of performance that are considered reasonable having regard to
the creditor’s position and field of business.

Secured debt means restructuring debt where a creditor holds an effective (against third parties) security interest
over assets that belong to or are in the possession of the debtor, in so far as the value of the security at the
commencement of the proceedings would have been sufficient to cover the amount of the creditor’s claim after

269


-----

the deduction of liquidation costs and claims with a higher priority. When the interdiction of debt collection is in
force, assets pledged by the debtor company as security cannot be liquidated by the pledge holder during
restructuring proceedings; instead, secured creditors’ receivables receive preferential treatment based on the
value of the security; most importantly their principal cannot be reduced (“cut”) in the restructuring program.
The part of the creditor’s claim that is not covered by the value of the security does not qualify as secured debt
but, instead, is regarded as unsecured debt for the purposes of the restructuring proceedings and may, thus be
subject to the measures described above. Regarding business mortgages, only 50% of the value of the mortgaged
assets will be considered as secured debt. The value of the assets will be determined in the restructuring program.

The following debt arrangements may be applied to secured debt: (i) changing the repayment schedule;
(ii) ordering that debt payments be applied as payments against principal first and as payments of interest and
other credit costs second; or (iii) reducing the obligation to pay interest and other credit costs with respect to the
remaining term of the debt. The restructuring program may also include the full or partial refinancing of secured
debt as a lump sum payment funded by the issuance of new debt.

Even if the debt arrangement does not affect the existence or content of a creditor’s security interest, the security
arrangements relating to the debt may be altered by replacing the security with another fully adequate security.

Payments on a secured debt shall be set so that at least the present value of the secured debt will be repaid within
a reasonable period, which shall not materially exceed the remainder of the credit period without the consent of
the creditor or, if the debt has become due in full, materially exceed half of the original credit period. As for
reducing interest and other credit costs, the length of the remaining credit period should be taken into
consideration in the restructuring program, so that the longer the remaining credit period, the smaller the
reduction in interest and credit costs.

**_Approval of the Restructuring Program_**

The draft of the restructuring program shall be drawn up by the restructuring administrator, and the court shall
affirm it subject to the approval of all the known creditors or with the acceptance of a majority of the voting
creditors in creditor groups in accordance with the Restructuring Act. However, there are some specific
limitations under the Restructuring Act relating to the affirmation of the restructuring program which apply even
if the restructuring program is approved by all creditors or the majority in all groups of creditors. Furthermore,
even if the majority does not exist in one or several groups of creditors, the restructuring program may
nonetheless be approved at the request of the person who has prepared the draft, the administrator or the debtor,
subject to the terms specified in the Restructuring Act. In such a case the restructuring claims of the creditors in
favor of the program must represent at minimum one-fifth of all restructuring claims of the debtor company
taken into consideration in the voting procedure in accordance with the Restructuring Act and at least one group
of creditors must have voted for the approval of the program by majority. The debtor may also submit a
restructuring program proposal to the court, which the court may consider in its discretion. There is also a
possibility of affirmation on the restructuring program in expedited proceedings provided that the program is
supported, in writing, by creditors whose claims total at least 80% of the overall total claims of the creditors, and
from each creditor whose claim is at least 5% of the overall total claims of the creditors.

**Bankruptcy**

A debtor or its qualifying creditor may apply for bankruptcy from a court of competent jurisdiction when the
debtor is unable to pay its debts and the inability to pay is not temporary (meaning, the company is considered
insolvent). If the application is approved, an estate administrator (or, in some cases, several estate administrators)
(FI: pesänhoitaja) will be appointed by the court.

A bankruptcy covers all the liabilities of the debtor, and its objective is to liquidate the assets of the debtor and
use the proceeds received in payment of the bankruptcy creditors’ claims. The bankruptcy estate may also
(subject to the bankruptcy creditors’ decision) continue the company’s business operations. The debtor’s assets
are, from the beginning of the bankruptcy, subject to the authority of the estate administrator. The bankruptcy
creditors are represented through the meeting of creditors. The estate administrator must act for the common
benefit of all bankruptcy creditors and shall comply with the decisions and guidelines of the bankruptcy creditors
in matters falling within the decision-making powers of the creditors.

**_Notices to the Bankruptcy Estate with regard to Claims_**

As a main rule, in order to be entitled to a disbursement (FI: jako-osuus), a creditor must file a claim in
bankruptcy in writing with the estate administrator, by a deadline, the lodgment date, set by the estate

270


-----

administrator in connection with the lodgment of claims (FI: konkurssivalvonta). However, there are some
specific exceptions in the Bankruptcy Act according to which a claim is to be taken into account without it being
filed. Information concerning the lodgment date shall be sent to the Legal Register Centre, the debtor and all
known creditors as well as in some cases in the Official Journal of Finland (FI: Virallinen lehti). The obligation
to notify the bankruptcy estate of a claim is binding even on a creditor with a secured claim. A creditor who
holds assets belonging to the debtor as security for the debt of a third party must, at the request of, and within a
time limit set by, the estate administrator, provide the same information on the receivables and security as should
be provided in a claim letter. A creditor who holds a business mortgage over the assets of the debtor, as referred
to in the Finnish Business Mortgages Act (FI: Yrityskiinnityslaki 634/1984, as amended), as security for a claim
against the debtor in bankruptcy or a debt owed by some other debtor shall file the claim as provided in the
Bankruptcy Act. If a claim is denominated in a currency other than euro, the value in euro for the purposes of the
bankruptcy proceedings is determined using the exchange rate of the date of commencement of the bankruptcy
proceedings.

A creditor who wishes to use his or her claim for set-off against a debt owed to the debtor must, when giving
notice of the set-off, provide the estate administrator with the same information that would be provided in a claim
letter. The notice of set-off must be made at the latest on the set lodgment date.

**_Disbursements_**

The estate administrator draws up a list of how the proceeds of the estate are to be divided among the creditors
(“draft disbursement list,” FI: jakoluetteloehdotus). The court verifies that the estate administrator’s draft
disbursement list meets the statutory requirements and that the procedural provisions relating to the draft
disbursement list have been observed. A creditor may make statements on the draft disbursement list in so far as
it concern’s the creditor’s claim. A creditor may also dispute the claim of another creditor or its precedence of
rank, as entered into the draft disbursement list. After having heard the creditors and also the debtor, the estate
administrator will draw up a (final) disbursement list by revising the draft disbursement list as he or she sees fit
on the basis of the disputes and statements. The estate administrator’s disbursement list shall be submitted to the
court for certification.

The creditors have an equal right to payment out of the proceeds of the bankruptcy estate in the proportion of the
amount of their claims, unless otherwise provided by law. However, according to the Finnish Act on the Order of
Payment of Creditors (1578/1992, as amended, FI: Laki velkojien maksusaantijärjestyksestä), the following
creditors have priority over unsecured creditors to receive their claims in the following order: (i) creditors of
secured claims (excluding claims secured by business mortgage) and holders of retention rights, with priority
over the proceeds from the respective security asset; (ii) creditors of the administrative expenses of the
bankruptcy estate, claims on the basis of contracts that the bankruptcy estate (rather than the debtor) has entered
into, any liabilities for which the bankruptcy estate is responsible by law and a debt that has arisen between the
commencement and discontinuation of restructuring proceedings; (iii) if the company has undergone
restructuring proceedings before the bankruptcy, (A) fees and expenses of the restructuring administrator with
interest on delayed payments incurred until the time of payment of the fees and expenses and after the
satisfaction of said payment and (B) creditors of a debt that has arisen between the commencement and
discontinuation of restructuring proceedings, and (iv) creditors with claims that are secured by a business
mortgage will receive prior to unsecured claims 50% of the value of the mortgaged assets. In case of secured
bankruptcy debts and bankruptcy debts secured by business mortgage, any debt exceeding the value of the assets
pledged as security (50% of the value in the case of business mortgage) is considered unsecured debt, unless
these fall under another basis of precedence (or subordination—please see below).

Under Finnish law, certain claims are settled after all other claims. In practice, the most significant of such
claims are the interest accruing on bankruptcy debt during the period after the commencement of the bankruptcy,
a bond that pursuant to its terms ranks after all the other obligations of the issuer and a subordinated loan that in
insolvency and liquidation may be settled after all the other creditors. The Finnish state has no preferential rights
regarding taxes and other fiscal charges.

The assets of the bankruptcy estate are to be liquidated (sold or otherwise disposed of) in the most advantageous
manner so as to maximize the aggregate net proceeds, for example by way of auctions, through advertising and
direct solicitation of potential buyers. However, creditors that are secured pursuant to a fixed charge over
movable or immovable property for their bankruptcy receivables may exercise a separate right of liquidation of
the assets pledged as security regardless of the bankruptcy proceedings. Such right is not available for creditors
secured by business mortgage.

271


-----

**_Enforcement of pledged property_**

The bankruptcy estate may at its own discretion prohibit the sale of pledged property for a maximum of two
months, but only once. The bankruptcy estate may sell secured assets belonging to the estate only if the creditor
to whom the assets have been pledged as security consents to the same or if the court grants a specific
permission. At the request of the bankruptcy estate, assets of the bankruptcy estate may also be sold in
accordance with the provisions of the Finnish Enforcement Code (705/2007, as amended, FI: Ulosottokaari,
“Enforcement Code”) if the bailiff consents to the same.

**Recovery of Assets**

Pursuant to the Recovery Act, certain acts carried out by a debtor can be revoked if the rights of the creditors
have been prejudiced by or as a result of those acts. According to the Restructuring Act and the Enforcement
Code, the grounds for recovery set forth in the Recovery Act shall also be applied in company restructuring and
enforcement proceedings.

The bankruptcy estate administrator, the restructuring administrator and certain creditors may seek the recovery
of assets of the debtor to the bankruptcy estate or the company under restructuring or enforcement proceedings,
in connection with bankruptcy, company restructuring or enforcement proceedings. The administrator or the
creditors may, within a specified recovery time, either file an action for recovery against the debtor’s
counterparty involved in the act in a separate court proceeding or file an objection against or make a statement
against a claim filed in bankruptcy. In bankruptcy, this period to file an action is one year from the
commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings or three months from the moment that the bankruptcy estate took
note or should have taken note of the grounds for recovery. In restructuring, the restructuring administrator must
file an action within six months from the commencement of the restructuring proceedings or within three months
from the moment that the administrator took note or should have taken note of the grounds for recovery.

Certain general rules for recovery apply to all transactions between an insolvent debtor (including a debtor who
becomes insolvent partially due to the transaction) and the counterparty of the debtor. A transaction concluded
within five years prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, company restructuring or enforcement was
filed with the court or another relevant authority (as well as transactions performed after such a date) may be
recovered if: (i) the transaction, either by itself or together with other transactions, improperly (a) favors a
creditor at the expense of other creditors, (b) places assets of the debtor beyond the reach of creditors, or
(c) increases debts to the detriment of creditors; (ii) the debtor, at the time of the transaction, was, or partly due to
the transaction became, insolvent, or over-indebted in case of a transaction that can be considered a gift or a
contract with the characteristics of a gift; (iii) the counterparty knew or should have known of the insolvency or
over-indebtedness, or the relevance of the transaction to the debtor’s economic situation; and (iv) the
counterparty knew or should have known of the facts mentioned above in clause (i), on the basis of which the
transaction is considered improper. The grounds for recovery under Section 5 of the Recovery Act, which covers
all transactions concluded between the debtor and a counterparty, are thus applicable only if the counterparty had
qualified or should have had qualified knowledge of all the issues described above in (i) and (ii). Transactions
between the debtor and certain (natural or legal) persons within the debtor’s sphere of interest (close parties,
FI: läheiset, as defined in the Recovery Act) may be recovered regardless of the date of the transaction and such
persons are assumed to have had knowledge of the issues described above in (i) and (ii). Also, the burden of
proof with regard to some matters related to the recovery, is reversed if the transaction was concluded between
such close parties.

Pursuant to the Recovery Act, certain transactions can, in certain circumstances, be recovered regardless of the
good faith of the counterparty and regardless of the solvency of the debtor at the time of the transaction. Such
transactions include, among other things: (i) payments received through enforcement; (ii) the payment of debts;
and (iii) the granting of security or other collateral (and (iv) gifts or contracts with characteristics of a gift, which
shall not be discussed further herein). Any debt paid later than three months prior to the date when the petition
for bankruptcy, company restructuring or enforcement was filed with the court or relevant authority (or, in the
event that the beneficiary is a person within the debtor’s sphere of interest, as described above, within two years)
may be recovered if: (i) unusual means of payment have been used; (ii) the payment was premature; or (iii) the
amount of payment was considerable in comparison to the assets of the debtor. However, a payment may not be
recovered if it, when all circumstances are taken into consideration, may be considered ordinary. A debt paid to a
natural or legal person within the debtor’s sphere of interest may be recovered in respect of the longer two-year
period unless it is shown that the debtor, at the time of the payment, was not insolvent or did not become
insolvent due to the payment. A security or other collateral given later than three months prior to the date when

272


-----

the petition for bankruptcy, company restructuring or enforcement was filed with the court or the relevant
authority (or, in the event that the beneficiary is a person within the debtor’s sphere of interest, within two years)
may be recovered if: (i) the parties had not agreed upon the security in connection with the creation of the debt;
or (ii) the possession of the security had not been transferred or another act perfecting the security had not been
completed without unjustified delay after the creation of the debt. A security given to a natural or legal person
within the debtor’s sphere of interest may be recovered in respect of the longer two-year period unless it is shown
that the debtor was not insolvent or did not become insolvent due to the arrangements for security.

When a transaction is recovered, the assets that have been received from the debtor are returned to the debtor or
the bankruptcy estate if the debtor is in bankruptcy. The bankruptcy estate or the debtor also returns the
compensation that had been paid for the assets. If the compensation has been placed beyond the reach of the
creditors and the party that paid the compensation knew or should have known that this was the intention of the
debtor, there is no obligation to return the compensation. If the assets to be returned no longer exist, or are
otherwise not returnable, compensation for the value of the assets must be made. In addition, should the return of
certain assets cause inconvenience to the party under such obligation, a court may entitle such party to pay
compensation equal to the value of the assets instead of returning the assets. The Recovery Act also sets forth an
obligation to compensate for any decrease in value of the returnable assets.

**Limitations on the validity and enforceability of guarantees and security**

Pursuant to the provisions of the Finnish Companies Act (624/2006, as amended, In Finnish Osakeyhtiölaki) (the
“Finnish Companies Act”) a Finnish limited liability company may not provide financing for, or grant guarantees
or security to secure the financing of, the acquisition of its or its parent company’s shares (financial assistance).

Further, a Finnish limited liability company can only distribute its assets in the ways specified in the Finnish
Companies Act. Other transactions that reduce the assets of a company or increase its liabilities without a
corporate benefit i.e., unless doing so is in the company’s own commercial interest, constitute an unlawful
distribution of assets. Granting of guarantees and security requires that the granting of guarantee/security is based
on sound business reasons (corporate benefit). The business justification for granting the guarantee or security is
assessed on a company-level and on a stand-alone basis. Group benefit can only be taken into regard in case the
issuer of the guarantee or security can be reasonably argued to derive as a member of the group a benefit itself as
a result of the overall group benefit. In addition to the corporate benefit requirement, the granting of the
guarantee/security has to be within the limits of the company’s business purpose (as set out in its articles of
association) and the company may not be insolvent and the granting of security may not result in the company
becoming insolvent.

For the abovementioned reasons, it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and
security documents to include, where such security is granted for third party liabilities (including other members
of the group), language pursuant to which the scope of guarantees and security granted by limited liability
companies incorporated in Finland is contractually limited so as to not be in conflict with the relevant statutory
limitations. The actual scope of a guarantee issued or security granted by a Finnish obligor may therefore be
substantially less than the aggregate amount of liabilities expressed to be guaranteed or secured and, in fact, it is
possible that owing to the application of mandatory Finnish law relating to unlawful profit distribution, as
applied to the guarantee or security granted, no liabilities or obligations will under Finnish law, be held to be
effectively guaranteed or secured.

**Creation of a valid security interest**

Other than in respect of the creation of registered mortgages over assets belonging to certain specific asset
classes (such as real estate, qualifying vehicles, ships, aircraft and intellectual property rights) capable of being
the subject of registered security, the creation of a valid and enforceable security interest under Finnish law is
achieved by pledging the security assets and perfecting such pledge, typically by transferring such security assets
into the exclusive physical possession of the pledgee. In order for the perfection to be effective, the pledgor must
be effectively deprived of its right to control, deal with or dispose of the security assets. If the pledgor remains in
possession of, retains exclusive or shared control over, or remains entitled to operate or collect, invest and
dispose of any income from such assets, the relevant security interest will not be deemed to have been effectively
created until it is duly perfected, typically after the occurrence of the agreed trigger event. Perfection cannot be
achieved once insolvency proceedings have been commenced and can be deemed susceptible and be set aside in
insolvency proceedings if perfected within a certain critical time before the commencement of insolvency
proceedings.

273


-----

**Enforcement of security**

The pledge of most movable assets (such as shares) may be enforced without a court judgment or the
involvement of an enforcement official or, should the pledgee deem it necessary, through official enforcement.
A pledge of shares is typically enforced by private sale and a pledge of receivables either by selling the
receivable or by the secured creditor collecting payment of the receivable. Typically, the collection of receivables
directly from the debtors of the pledgor results in a more expedient and profitable outcome than a sale of the
receivables, both of which are forms of self-enforcement. In case the debtor does not pay the debts in the due
time, the pledgee has the possibility to file a claim to the District Court in order to obtain a summary judgment,
which can be used as grounds for official enforcement.

The Finnish Commercial Code (3/1734, as amended, Kauppakaari) stipulates a default process in respect of an
enforcement of pledge of movable assets. The parties may, as a rule, contract out most parts of the default
process. The parties’ discretion with regard to the enforcement methods is, however, limited (a) by the statutory
invalidity of a contractual provision providing that title to the pledged asset shall, upon default, automatically
transfer to the pledgee (however, the debtor and creditor may, after the pledgee has become entitled to enforce
the security, effectively agree that an obligation is discharged partly or in full by the pledgee assuming ownership
of the pledged asset), and (b) by the pledgee always having a duty to ascertain that the interests of the pledgor
and other creditors of the pledgor are not unduly jeopardized due to the actions taken by the pledgee.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

**Sweden**

Pursuant to the provisions of Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of
December 12, 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial
matters (hereinafter the “Recast Brussels Regulation,” which apply to proceedings instituted, and judgments
issued, from January 10, 2015), a judgment issued against a company in the courts of a member state of the
European Union (hereinafter a “Member State”) which is enforceable in that Member State, will be directly
enforceable in Sweden provided that the formal requirements in the Recast Brussels Regulation are satisfied. An
application for refusal of enforcement may be lodged with the competent Swedish district court. Where such
application is lodged the Swedish court may stay the proceedings if an ordinary appeal against the judgment has
been lodged in the Member State of origin or the time for such appeal has not yet expired.

Under the 2007 Lugano Convention on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil
and commercial matters (hereinafter the “Lugano Convention”), a judgment issued against a company in the
courts of a member state of the European Union or the European Free Trade Association (hereinafter a
“Contracting State”) which is enforceable in that Contracting State, will be enforceable in Sweden upon the
fulfilment of the following requirements: (a) that a motion for enforcement has been granted by the competent
Swedish district court, and (b) that the formal requirements in the Lugano Convention have been fulfilled.

Judgments issued against a Swedish party in the courts of a state which is not a Member State or a Contracting
State (hereinafter a “Third Country”) are, as a general rule, not legally recognized or enforceable in Sweden.
Instead, a Third Country judgment will be regarded by a Swedish court, administrative tribunal or executive or
other public authority merely as factual evidence of, for example, the outcome or circumstances of the dispute to
which the judgment relates. The United States is a Third Country. Thus, New York law, which is the governing
law of the Additional Notes and the Indenture, falls into the foregoing category. Thus, separate legal proceedings
on the same subject matter must generally be commenced in Sweden. During those proceedings the Swedish
court will, as a general rule, not be bound by the outcome of the Third Country judgment and may choose to try
the dispute without regard to the Third Country judgment. Under certain conditions, including where a contract
under review contains an exclusive jurisdiction clause in favor of the Third Country courts, the Swedish court
will not re-examine the merits of the claim. Instead, the Swedish court in that case may render a judgment based
on the foreign judgment. However, it is nevertheless the Swedish, and not the Third Country, judgment that will
ultimately be enforced. Following the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union and the end of the
United Kingdom’s transition period, the United Kingdom is deemed a Third Country for the purposes of the
Recast Brussels Regulation and the Lugano Convention. However, judgments obtained from a court in the United
Kingdom in respect of an exclusive jurisdiction clause under a contract dated on, or after, January 1, 2021, may
thereafter be enforced in accordance with, and subject to the fulfilment of the relevant conditions of, the 2005
Hague Convention on choice of court agreements, to which the European Union is a contracting state and the
United Kingdom acceded effective from January 1, 2021. Consequently, judgments obtained from a court in the
United Kingdom and which either do not fulfil the foregoing requirements or which relate to a contract dated
prior to January 1, 2021, may not be enforced in accordance with the Hague Convention.

Foreign arbitral awards are enforceable in Sweden pursuant to the Swedish Arbitration Act which reflects the
rules of the New York Convention (to which Sweden has acceded).

**Norway**

A civil judgment/ruling or in-court settlement (a “judgment”) against a Norwegian party passed by the courts of a
foreign state may be recognized and enforceable in Norway if (i) such judgement concerns civil or commercial
matter to which the Lugano Convention on the Recognition of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters
applies, and such state is a Contracting State (as defined in the Lugano Convention) or (ii) such state is a state
with which Norway has entered into a convention on the mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments, or
(iii) the jurisdiction of the foreign court has been specifically agreed between the parties in a particular civil
matter in accordance with the Norwegian Civil Procedure Act of June 17, 2005 No. 90 section 4-6. The Lugano
Convention does not apply to (i) the status or legal capacity of natural persons, rights in property arising out of a
matrimonial relationship, wills and succession; (ii) bankruptcy, proceedings relating to the winding up of
insolvent companies or other legal persons, judicial arrangements, compositions and analogous proceedings;
(iii) social security; (iv) arbitration.

Foreign arbitral awards are enforceable in Norway pursuant to the Norwegian Arbitration Act of 14 May, 2004
No 25 section 45 and 46 which reflects the rules of the New York Convention (to which Norway has acceded).

281


-----

Furthermore, a judgment will only be recognized or enforceable as a matter of right if it is (i) final,
non-appealable, conclusive and enforceable in and pursuant to the laws of the country in which it has been
passed, and (ii) not given in default of appearance (and the legal action opening the case was not served to the
defendant), or if it is irreconcilable with a judgment given in a dispute between the same parties in the state in
which recognition is sought or with an earlier judgment given in another state bound by the Lugano Convention
or in a third state involving the same cause of action and between the same parties, pursuant to the Lugano
Convention article 34, and (iii) the recognition and enforcement of the judgment is not considered to be in
conflict with decency or Norwegian mandatory law or public policy (“ordre public”), cf. the Norwegian Civil
Procedure Act of June 17, 2005 No. 90 section 19-16.

The foregoing could imply, inter alia, that judgments by U.S. courts may not be recognized or enforceable in
Norway as a matter of right. However, such judgments may be admissible as evidence in the courts of law,
executive or other public authorities of Norway and may, assuming the same applicable law applies (lex causae),
in such capacity carry persuasive authority depending on the merits of the judgment limiting the need for a full
retrial on its merits.

A civil judgements in the United Kingdom will be recognized and enforceable in Norway pursuant to the
bilateral agreement with the United Kingdom dated October 13, 2020, declaring the continued application of the
bilateral convention between the United Kingdom and Norway providing reciprocal recognition and enforcement
of judgments in civil matters dated June 12, 1961.

Unaudited Condensed Interim Financial Statements for the Assemblin
Group as of and for the nine months period ended 30 September 2020

**Notes**

**Note 1 Accounting policies**

**Basis of preparation**

These condensed interim financial statements have been prepared for the purpose of inclusion in an offering
memorandum, since Assemblin Financing AB (publ) will issue a bond that is planned to be listed on an
unregulated market (an International Stock Exchange). The financial statements of Assemblin Group (“the
Group”) include Assemblin Financing AB (publ) (559077-5952), Assemblin Holding AB (559025-2952) and its
subsidiaries.

The condensed interim financial statements for the three and nine months ended 30 September 2019 have been
prepared as combined financial statements in a way of illustrating financial information for a group of entities
that are not a legal group but are ultimately owned and controlled by the same party. These combined financial
statements represent the group of entities that became the Group on 6 December 2019 when the parent company
of the Group, Assemblin Financing AB, acquired 100% of the shares in a related company, Assemblin Holding
AB, from their parent company, Ignition MidCo S.a.r.l, (“Midco”) included in Triton Fund IV since 2015.

Assemblin Holding AB was established on 10 July 2015 and is a holding company with operating subsidiaries.
Until 6 December 2019 it operated under the direct control from its parent company, MidCo. Assemblin
Financing AB was established on 6 December 2016 and is under the direct control from its parent company,
MidCo.

On 6 December 2019, Assemblin Financing AB acquired all shares in Assemblin Holding AB from Midco for
SEK 5,081 million. The consideration paid represents the fair value of the acquired net assets and business at the
time of the transaction. For the consideration Assemblin Financing AB issued two promissory notes to Midco,
one in the amount of SEK 992 million (“Promissory Note 1”) and one in the amount of SEK 4,089 million
(“Promissory Note 2”). Promissory Note 1 was repaid in full on 6 December 2019. The principal amount under
Promissory Note 2 was contributed as equity in Assemblin Financing AB by Midco by way of a shareholder
contribution.

When Assemblin Financing AB legally acquired Assemblin Holding AB the net assets in the consolidated
financial statements were not revalued resulting in a reduction to equity. This reduction is presented as a merger
reserve consisting of a net of the SEK 5,081 million purchase price and Assemblin Financing AB’s SEK
0 million equity. Also recognized in the merger reserve is the SEK 4,089 million shareholder contribution from
Midco through the forgiveness of Promissory Note 2 in connection with the transaction

The condensed financial statements for the three and nine months ended 30 September 2020 represent the legal
Assembling Financing Group which is the same group of entities as in the combined financial statements for the
three and nine months ended 30 September 2019. The combined financial statements do not differ from
consolidated financial statements based on historical values and predecessor accounting.

Accordingly, the consolidated Group represents a continuation of Assemblin Holdings AB and its subsidiaries’
operations. In order to reflect the economics of the restructuring (without change of control or change in
operating activities) and provide the users with relevant information, management elected to present, as the
‘combined’ financial information, the financial information of Assemblin Holdings AB and subsidiaries up until
the creation of the accounting group. Therefore, financial statements presented reflect:

Š As of 30 September 2020 and 31 December 2019, the consolidated statement of financial position of
Assemblin Financing AB.

Š For the three and nine months ended on 30 September 2019, the combined statements of profit or loss,
comprehensive income, cash flows, changes in equity of Assemblin Holdings AB including its
subsidiaries, and the legal entity Assemblin Financing AB.

Š For the three and nine months ended on 30 September 2020, the consolidated statements of profit or
loss, comprehensive income, cash flows, changes in equity of Assemblin Financing AB.

Unaudited Condensed Interim Financial Statements for the Assemblin
Group as of and for the nine months period ended 30 September 2020

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. These
reclassifications had no effect on the reported results of operations.

**Statement of compliance**

The condensed financial statement was prepared in accordance with IAS 34 “Interim financial reporting”. The
same accounting policies and bases for calculation have been applied as in the combined financial statements for
the years 2019 and 2018 presented in this document.

**Restructuring**

The nine months ended 30 September 2020 include costs for restructuring. The restructuring costs relate to
closure of branches and restructuring of the Stockholm branch including redundancies of personnel SEK 26
million, project-related adjustments of SEK 14 million and income from sale of business in Finland SEK 6
million.

**Seasonality**

The operating results generally vary from quarter to quarter as a result of changes in general economic conditions
and seasonal fluctuations. This means that the results in one quarter are not necessarily indicative of the
performance in a future quarter. Fluctuations in net revenue from quarter to quarter can also be attributed to
inclement weather and to the main annual holiday period in June, July and August.

**COVID-19 Pandemic**

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the operating results this year in addition to the typical seasonal
fluctuations in the business. There have been disruptions in installation projects (due to COVID-19 outbreaks at a
limited number of construction sites) and services assignments (due to stringent lock-down measures in the
second quarter of 2020), to date these have not been significant. The ultimate significance of the impact will be
primarily determined by the length of time that such reductions and disruptions continue, which will, in turn,
depend on the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of measures that might be imposed in
response to the pandemic and whether a vaccine or drug can be developed and deployed that allows business
operations to return to their pre-pandemic form. There has been no impairment or restructuring charges
recognized in the three and nine months ended 30 September 2020 as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Assemblin finalized seven acquisitions in the period from January to September. These acquisitions are not
considered to be material, either individually or jointly.

**Note 4 Financial instruments**

Shares in Elajo, “Financial investments”, are recognized at assessed fair value via other comprehensive income.
The valuation of the shares is performed according to level 3, since the valuation is based on non-observable
inputs. Fair value as of 30 September 2020 amounts to SEK 30 million and, at the beginning of the year the fair
value amounted to SEK 30 million.

The fair value has been calculated on the basis of a profit multiple based on operating profit. The profit multiple
is derived based on Assemblin’s experience in acquiring unlisted installation companies. In case the profit
multiple and/or operating profit increases, the fair value will also increase.

The amount entered as a liability that could be paid to previous owners is SEK 84 million, falling due for
payment within one to three years and classified as Level 3 liabilities. The fair value of contingent considerations
is measured based on assumptions about expected future payments based in the expected future earnings in the
acquired company. Expected future payments are not discounted as it is assessed that there is no time value based
on the fact that it is not considered significant. The estimated fair value would decrease (increase) if the expected
future earnings in the acquired company were lower (higher). When calculating the fair value of currency swaps
the closing quote from the respective counterparties has been used. The liability is SEK 28 million and classified
as a Level 2 liability.

Unaudited Condensed Interim Financial Statements for the Assemblin
Group as of and for the nine months period ended 30 September 2020

**Note 5 Pensions**

The present value of pension obligations was established by an independent actuary based on certain financial
assumptions. The assumptions for inflation and future salary growth have decreased since year-end, reducing the
liability, while the discount rate has been lowered, thus increasing the liability. As a result, an actuarial loss of
SEK 1 million (nine months period ended 30 September 2019: 100) was recognized in other comprehensive
income during the interim period and an actuarial gain of SEK 38 million (nine months period ended
30 September 2019: 100) for the nine months period ended 31 September 2020. Relating to this, a deferred tax of
SEK 0 million (nine months period ended 30 September 2019: 21) has been recognized in other comprehensive
income during the interim period and SEK 8 million (nine months period ended 30 September 2019: 21) for the
nine months period ended 31 September 2020. The key assumptions for defined-benefit obligations are presented
below:

**Note 6 Related party transactions**

No transactions that substantially impacted the company’s financial position and earnings took place between
Assemblin and related parties during the period.

**Note 7 Subsequent events**

On 8 December 2020, Assemblin entered into a sale and purchase agreement to acquire Fidelix Holding Oy with
subsidiaries. The acquisition is subject to approval from the Finnish competition authority and is expected to
close in the first quarter of 2021. The company is based in Vanda, Finland, and provides climate smart building
automation and management systems. The Fidelix group has 360 employees and annual revenue of SEK 540
million.

In addition to the Fidelix acquisition, the Group has acquired 13 entities after the balance sheet date of
30 September 2020. Individually, these acquisitions are not considered material, however, they are considered to
be material in the aggregate. The considerations for the acquisitions are paid in cash and amount to SEK 310
million and are based on the assessed enterprise value subject to adjustment for net debt and working capital. For
some of the acquisitions there are also contingent consideration arrangements with a maximum of SEK 80
million. The purchase price allocations are not finalized for the acquisitions.

**Note 8 Alternative performance measures**

This document contains alternative performance measures. These measures describe historical financial
performance, but excludes or includes amounts that would not be adjusted for in the most comparable IFRS
financial measure. The alternative performance measures are used internally by management, in conjunction with
IFRS financial measures, to measure performance and make decisions regarding the future direction of the
business. Management believes these alternative performance measures, when provided in combination with
reported IFRS results, provide helpful supplementary information for investors. These measures are not a
substitute for or superior to, and should be used in conjunction with, reported IFRS financial measures. In
addition, the alternative performance measures, as defined by Assemblin, may not be comparable to other
similarly titled measures used by other companies. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these
alternative performance measures.

- The combination where Assemblin Financing AB legally acquired Assemblin Holding AB group on
6 December 2019 was a common control transaction as both entities were owned and controlled by Ignition
MidCo S.a.r.l. As a result, the net assets in the consolidated financial statements of the acquisition were not
revalued resulting in a reduction to equity. This reduction is presented as a merger reserve consisting of a
net of the SEK 5,081 million purchase price and Assemblin Financing AB’s SEK 0 million equity. Also
recognized in the merger reserve is the SEK 4,089 million shareholder contribution from Midco through the
forgiveness of Promissory Note 2 in connection with the transaction. Refer to Note 1, Basis for preparation.

For additional information on equity, refer to Note 11.

**Combined financial statements of Assemblin Group for financial years 2019, 2018 and 2017**

**Note 1 – Significant accounting policies**

**Basis for preparation**

These combined financial statements have been prepared for the purpose of inclusion in an offering
memorandum, since Assemblin Financing AB (publ) will issue a bond that is planned to be listed on an
unregulated market (an International Stock Exchange). The financial statements of Assemblin Group (“the
Group”) include Assemblin Financing AB (publ) (559077-5952), Assemblin Holding AB (559025-2952) and its
subsidiaries.

The financial statements have been prepared as combined financial statements in a way of illustrating financial
information for a group of entities that are not a legal group but are ultimately owned by the same party. These
combined financial statements represent the group of entities that became the Group on 6 December 2019 when
the parent company of the Group, Assemblin Financing AB, acquired 100% of the shares in a related company,
Assemblin Holding AB, from their parent company, Ignition MidCo S.a.r.l, (“Midco”) included in Triton Fund
IV since 2015.

There are no standards applicable under International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) for combined
financial statements. The combined financial statements have been prepared using the historical IFRS financial
information included in the Group without any remeasurements of the previously recorded IFRS values. The
term “combined financial statements” refers to financial information prepared by aggregating financial
information for entities under common control that do not meet the definition of a group according to IFRS 10.
All intra-group transactions between legal entities within the reporting entity have been eliminated. As a result,
the combined financial statements represent the economic activities of the reporting entity that was formed on
6 December 2019. A complete register of the entities that constitute the Group is presented in the combined
financial statements, see Note 29.

Assemblin Holding AB was established on 10 July 2015 and is a holding company with operating subsidiaries.
Until 6 December 2019 it operated under the direct control from its parent company, MidCo. Assemblin
Financing AB was established on 6 December 2016 and is under the direct control from its parent company,
MidCo.

On 6 December 2019, Assemblin Financing AB acquired all shares in Assemblin Holding AB from Midco for
SEK 5,081 million. The consideration paid represents the fair value of the acquired net assets and business at the
time of the transaction. For the consideration Assemblin Financing AB issued two promissory notes to Midco,
one in the amount of SEK 992 million (“Promissory Note 1”) and one in the amount of SEK 4,089 million
(“Promissory Note 2”). Promissory Note 1 was repaid in full on 6 December 2019. The principal amount under
Promissory Note 2 was contributed as equity in Assemblin Financing AB by Midco by way of a shareholder
contribution.

When Assemblin Financing AB legally acquired Assemblin Holding AB the net assets in the consolidated
financial statements were not revalued resulting in a reduction to equity. This reduction is presented as a merger
reserve consisting of a net of the SEK 5,081 million purchase price and Assemblin Financing AB’s SEK
0 million equity. Also recognized in the merger reserve is the SEK 4,089 million shareholder contribution from
Midco through the forgiveness of Promissory Note 2 in connection with the transaction.

The combined financial statements do not differ from consolidated financial statements from 6 December 2019
based on historical values and predecessor accounting.

Accordingly, the consolidated Group represents a continuation of Assemblin Holdings AB and its subsidiaries’
operations. In order to reflect the economics of the restructuring (without change of control or change in
operating activities) and provide the users with relevant information, management elected to present, as the
‘combined’ financial information, the financial information of Assemblin Holdings AB and subsidiaries up until
the creation of the accounting group. Therefore, the combined financial statements presented reflect:

Š As of 31 December 2017 and 2018, the combined statements of financial position of Assemblin Holdings
AB including its subsidiaries and the legal entity Assemblin Financing AB.

Š As of 31 December 2019, the consolidated statement of financial position of Assemblin Financing AB.

**Combined financial statements of Assemblin Group for financial years 2019, 2018 and 2017**

Š For the years ended on 31 December 2017 and 2018, the combined statements of profit or loss,
comprehensive income, cash flows, changes in equity of Assemblin Holdings AB including its subsidiaries,
and the legal entity Assemblin Financing AB.

Š For the year ended on 31 December 2019:

(i) combined statements of profit or loss, comprehensive income, cash flows, changes in equity of Assemblin
Holdings AB including its subsidiaries, and the legal entity Assemblin Financing AB for the period of
1 January 2019 to 5 December 2019, inclusive; and

(ii) consolidated statements of profit or loss, comprehensive income, cash flows, changes in equity of
Assemblin Financing AB for the period of 6 December 2019 to 31 December 2019.

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. These
reclassifications had no effect on the reported results of operations.

**Statement of compliance**

The combined financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU. Further, the Swedish Financial Reporting Board’s recommendation,
RFR 1 Supplementary Accounting Rules for Corporate Groups, has been applied.

The combined financial statements were approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 19 January 2021.

Unless otherwise indicated, the amounts in the report are in SEK million rounded to the nearest million, which
may result in rounding difference.

**Measurement policies used when preparing the financial statements**

Assets and liabilities are recognized at historical cost, except for certain financial assets and liabilities that are
measured at fair value. Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value consist of unlisted shares and
participations, as well as derivatives. A defined-benefit pension liability or asset is recognized at the net of fair
value of plan assets and the present value of the defined-benefit liability, adjusted for any asset ceilings.

**Functional currency and reporting currency**

The parent company´s functional currency is the Swedish krona, which also constitutes the reporting currency for
the Group. This means that the combined financial statements are presented in Swedish kronor. All amounts are
rounded to the nearest million, unless otherwise indicated.

**Judgements and estimates in the financial statements**

Preparing the financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires company management to make judgements
and estimates, and make assumptions that affect the application of the accounting policies and the recognized
amounts for assets, liabilities, revenue and costs. Actual outcomes may deviate from these estimates and
judgements.

The estimates and assumptions are reviewed on a regular basis. Changes to estimates are recognized in the period
the change is made, if the change only affected that period, or in the period the change is made and future periods
if the change affects both the period in question and future periods.

Judgements made by company management when applying IFRS that have significant impact on the financial
statements, and estimates made that could entail significant adjustments in the financial statements for the
following year, are described in more detail in Note 30.

**Changes in accounting policies attributable to new or amended IFRS**

The Group applies IFRS 16 from 1 January 2019. Other amendments of IFRS, applied from 1 January 2019, have
had no material effect on the Group’s accounting.

**Combined financial statements of Assemblin Group for financial years 2019, 2018 and 2017**

**IFRS 16**

As of 1 January 2019, Assemblin adopted IFRS 16 Leases. This reporting standard replaces IAS 17 Leases. The
Group has selected the modified retrospective approach as the transition method, which means that the
comparison figures for 2018, 2017 and earlier periods are not restated, and that the difference between
right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized in equity adjusted for pre-paid lease expenses and reserves
for onerous contracts as at 1 January 2019. The effects of IFRS 16 are recognized at the Group level. The Group
recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the commencement date of a lease. The right-of-use asset
is initially measured at cost, which consists of the original value of the lease liability plus lease expenses paid on
or before the commencement date and any initial direct expenses. The right-of-use asset is thereafter depreciated
on a straight-line basis from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the asset and the
end of the lease term.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the future lease expenses over the term of the lease
that have not been paid on the commencement date. The lease expenses are discounted with the incremental
borrowing rate or implicit interest rate of the lease. The term of the lease comprises the non-cancellable period,
with the addition of further periods in the contract if, on the commencement date, it is deemed reasonably certain
that these will be exercised

The lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective rate method. The lease liability is remeasured
if the future lease expenses change as the result of such factors as changes to an index or price. When the lease
liability is remeasured this way, an equivalent adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use
asset.

**_Leases where the Group is lessee_**

Previously, the Group determined whether an agreement contained a lease in accordance with IFRIC 4
Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease. As of 1 January 2019, the Group determines whether an
agreement contains a lease based on the definition of leases in IFRS 16.

At the transition to IFRS 16, the Group chose to apply the relief rule of “inheriting” the previous definition of
leasing in conjunction with the transition. This means that IFRS 16 is applied to agreements that were previously
identified as leases, and that IFRS 16 is not applied to agreements that previously were deemed not to contain
leases. Consequently, the definition of leases under IFRS 16 is applied only the agreements that were amended or
signed after 1 January 2019.

Previously, the Group classified leases as operating or finance leases based on whether the lease transferred the
risks and rewards of ownership of the underlying asset. In accordance with IFRS 16, the Group recognizes
right-of- use assets and lease liabilities for most leases (i.e. the lease is included in the statement of financial
position); exemptions from this are indicated below.

_Leases previously classified as operating leases under IAS 17_

At the transition, the lease liabilities were measured at the present value of the remaining lease expenses,
discounted by the Group’s incremental borrowing rates on the initial date of application (1 January 2019). Each
right-of-use asset was measured at an amount corresponding to the lease liability, adjusted for any prepaid or
accrued lease expenses and reserves for onerous contracts.

The Group has chosen to apply the following solutions in practice:

Š Applied a discount rate based on the Group’s financing expenses on various maturities.

Š Adjusted the right-of-use asset by an amount recognized as a provision for operating leases that constituted
onerous leases, immediately before the first date of application, as an alternative to performing an
impairment review.

Š Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities have not been recognized for leases for which the lease term finishes
within 12 months or earlier (short- term leases).

Š Excluded initial direct payments from the measurement of right-of-use assets on the initial date of
application.

**_Effect on the financial statements_**

At the transition to IFRS 16, the Group recognized right-of-use assets of SEK 723 million and lease liabilities of
SEK 760 million, of which SEK 80 million are short-term lease liabilities. The difference between assets and
liabilities is due to the reclassification of pre-paid lease expenses, and moreover, rights of use being recognized
based on IFRS 16 having been applied since the start of the agreement as well as the right-of-use assets being
reduced by reserves for onerous leases recognized in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities
and Contingent Assets immediately prior to the transition to IFRS 16 on 31 December 2018.

When measuring the lease liability, the Group discounted its lease expenses at the incremental borrowing rate at
1 January 2019. The interest rate used in discounting future flows lies between 1.7 and 4.8 per cent, depending on
the tenor of the contract. Previous financial leases have been reclassified from Property, plant and equipment to
Right-of-use assets. The right-of use assets recognized are attributable to the following types of assets:

**Classification**

Fixed assets and long-term liabilities essentially consist of amounts that are expected to be recovered or settled
more than twelve months after the balance sheet date. Current assets and short-term liabilities essentially consist
of amounts that are expected to be recovered or settled within twelve months of the balance sheet date.

**Operating segment reporting**

An operating segment is part of the Group that conducts operations from which it can generate revenue and incur
costs, and for which independent financial information is available. Earnings from an operating segment are
further monitored by the company’s chief operating decision maker to evaluate results and to allocate resources
to the operating segment. Refer to Note 3 for additional descriptions of the divisions, and the presentation of the
operating segments.

**Consolidation principles and business combinations**

Subsidiaries are companies that are subject to a controlling interest from the Parent Company. A controlling
interest exists if the Parent Company has influence over the investment object, is exposed to or has the right to a
variable yield from its involvement and can use its influence over the investment to affect the yield. In
determining whether controlling influence exists, shares that are potentially entitled to vote — and whether de
facto control exists — are taken into account.

Subsidiaries are recognized using the acquisition method, which involves the acquisition of a subsidiary being
regarded as a transaction through which the Group indirectly acquires the assets of the subsidiary and assumes its
liabilities. The acquisition analysis establishes the fair value, on the acquisition date, of identifiable assets
acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as any holdings with a non-controlling interest. Transaction
expenditures that arise, except transaction expenditures attributable to the issue of equity instruments or debt
instruments, are recognized directly in profit or loss for the year.

In the event of business combinations in which transferred remuneration, any holdings with a non-controlling
interest and the fair value of previously owned participations (in conjunction with step acquisitions) exceed the
value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed that are recognized separately, the difference is recognized as
goodwill. When the difference is negative (bargain purchase), this is recognized directly in profit or loss for the
year. Transferred remuneration in connection with the acquisition does not include payments relating to
settlement of previous business relationships. These types of settlement are usually recognized in earnings.

Contingent considerations are recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. In cases where the contingent
consideration is classified as an equity instrument, no restatement is performed, and settlement is made within
equity. Other contingent considerations are restated at every reporting date, and the change is recognized in profit
or loss for the year.

**Transactions eliminated in consolidation**

Intra-Group receivables and liabilities, revenue or costs and unrealized profit or loss that arise from intra-Group
transactions among Group companies are eliminated entirely in preparing the combined financial statements.
Unrealized profits arising from transactions with joint ventures are eliminated to the extent corresponding to the
Group’s ownership share in the company. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same manner as unrealized
profits, but only to the extent there is no need for impairment.

**Joint ventures**

In the accounts, joint ventures are those companies for which the Group, through partnership agreements with
one or more parties, has a joint controlling interest in which the Group has the right to net assets instead of a
direct right to assets and commitments in liabilities. Holdings in joint ventures are consolidated in the combined
financial statements in accordance with the equity method and are initially recognized at cost, which includes
transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the combined financial statements include the Group´s share
of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the joint venture, until the joint control ceases. The
equity method is applied from the date that joint controlling interest was obtained, up until the point when the
joint controlling interest is dissolved.

**Equity method**

The equity method means that in the Group, the carrying amount of the shares in joint ventures corresponds to
the Group’s share of equity in joint ventures. The Group’s share in joint ventures is recognized in profit or loss.

These shares of profits constitute the primary change in the carrying amount of shares in joint ventures.
Transaction expenditures that arise, except transaction expenditures attributable to the issue of equity instruments
or debt instruments, are included in cost.

**Combined financial statements of Assemblin Group for financial years 2019, 2018 and 2017**

**Foreign currency**
**_Transactions in foreign currency_**
Transactions in foreign currency are restated in the functional currency at the exchange rate in effect on the
transaction date. Functional currency is the currency in the primary financial environments where the companies
conduct their operations. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency are restated in the functional
currency at the exchange rate in effect on the balance-sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising in the
restatements are recognized in profit or loss for the year. Non-monetary assets and liabilities recognized at
historical cost are restated at the exchange rate on the transaction date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities
recognized at fair value are restated in the functional currency at the exchange rate in effect on the date of
measurement at fair value.

**Financial reports from operations abroad**
Assets and liabilities in operations abroad, including goodwill and other Group-related surpluses and deficits, are
restated from the functional currency of the operations abroad in the Group’s reporting currency at the exchange
rate in effect on the balance-sheet date. Revenue and expenses in operations abroad are restated in Swedish
kronor at an average rate that constituted an approximation of the exchange rates that were in effect on the
respective transaction dates. Translation differences arising in connection with currency restatements are
recognized in other comprehensive income, and are accumulated in a separate component in equity, designated as
translation reserves. In the event the operations abroad are not wholly owned, the translation difference is
allocated to holdings with a non-controlling interest based on its proportional ownership share. When controlling
interest, significant interest or joint controlling interest for operations abroad are dissolved, the accumulated
translation differences attributable to the operations are realized, at which point they are reclassified from the
translation reserves in equity to profit or loss for the year. In the event a sale occurs but controlling interest
remains, a proportional share of accumulated translation differences from the translation reserve is transferred to
holdings with a non-controlling interest. In the event of a sale of portions of joint ventures where joint controlling
interest remains, a proportional share of the translation differences is reclassified to profit or loss for the year.

**Revenue**
**_Policy applicable from 1 January 2018_**
Revenue is recognized in earnings when control over goods and services is transferred to the customer. The
company’s revenue consists primarily of revenue from construction contracts and service assignments. This
revenue is recognized over time; it is described below under Construction contracts and Service assignments.
Interest income is recognized in revenue over the duration in the contract, with application of the effective rate
method. Dividend revenue is recognized when the right to receive payment has been established.

The operations are divided into three areas: electricity, ventilation, and heating and sanitation. In all the areas of
operation, the revenue streams consist of revenue from construction contracts and service assignments,
respectively.

_Construction contracts_
In regards to the construction contracts, they are fixed price and revenue from ongoing contracts is recognized
over time on the basis of assignment expenditures incurred in relation to the total estimated assignment fees of
the assignment. Costs associated with this are recognized in earnings as they arise. In the statement of financial
position, contract assignments are recognized gross project by project, either as a contract asset among current
assets or as a contract liability among current liabilities. The projects with higher levels of generated revenue
than has been invoiced are recognized as assets, whereas the projects that have been invoiced for more than
revenue generated are recognized as liabilities. Revenue is based on a contractual fixed price; the remuneration
amount is variable only in exceptional cases.

Payment is usually received in stages while the construction contracts is being completed; payment is normally
received before the stage is begun. In a number of construction contracts, however, payment is received after the
stage is completed.

Changes in the scope of the assignment, claims and incentive remuneration are included in project revenue to the
extent that they are agreed upon with the customer and can be reliably measured.

A fundamental condition for reporting revenue over time is that the course of events can reasonably be measured
against completion of the performance obligation. For projects in which the outcome of a performance obligation
cannot reasonably be measured, but coverage is expected for the expenditures that arise from completing the
performance obligation, only revenue for expenditures incurred up until the result of the performance obligation
can reasonably be measured is reported.

F-29


-----

**Combined financial statements of Assemblin Group for financial years 2019, 2018 and 2017**

The Group reports as assets (balance-sheet item Contract assets) from clients in construction contracts for which
project costs and recognized profits (less recognized losses) exceed the invoiced amounts. Partially invoiced
amounts that have not yet been settled by the customer, and amounts held by the client are included in Trade
receivables. The Group reports as liabilities (balance-sheet item Contract liabilities) all liabilities to clients in
ongoing construction contracts for which invoiced amounts exceed project costs and recognized profits (less
recognized losses).

_Service assignments_

In regards to service assignments, revenue and the appurtenant costs are recognized over time (i.e. in pace with
the service being provided to the customer). Measurement of the course of events is established on the basis of
assignment expenditures incurred in relation to the total estimated assignment expenditures. A number of service
assignments are charged by the hour on open account; in such cases, the customer normally receives the services
provided on an hour-by-hour basis. In other service assignments, payment is normally received after the
assignment is completed.

**_Policy applicable before 1 January 2018_**

Revenue is recognized in profit or loss when the amount of revenue can be measured reliably, and it is probable
that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity. Revenue is recognized
according to the percentage of completion method.

_Construction contracts_

The group applies the percentage of completion method. Under the percentage of completion method, profit or
loss is recognized in proportion to the stage of completion. To determine the profit or loss incurred at a given
point in time, information about the following components is needed:

Š Project revenue – the aggregated value of revenue attributable to the construction contract.

Š Project cost all costs relating to project revenue which are attributable to the individual project.

Š Stage of completion – recognized costs in relation to estimated total costs of the project.

A basic condition for the percentage of completion method is that project revenue and project cost can be
measured reliably, and that the stage of completion must be determined in a way that is relevant with respect to
the requirement of reliability.

A zero-profit margin is used for projects where revenue and costs cannot be measured reliably. This means that
the project is recognized with an income that corresponds to the incurred cost, i.e. profit is recognized to SEK 0
pending an assessment of profit. As soon as possible, revenue is recognized according to the percentage of
completion method.

As an asset, the Group recognizes receivables (balance sheet item: Revenue generated but uninvoiced) from
customers for construction contracts where project costs and recognized profits (after deductions for recognized
losses) exceed the invoiced amounts. Partly invoiced amounts that have not yet been paid by the customer and
amounts withheld by the customer are included in the item Accounts receivable. As a liability (Revenue invoiced
but not generated), the Group recognizes all liabilities to customers in construction contracts for ongoing
assignments where invoiced amounts exceed project costs and recognized profits (after deductions for recognized
losses).

**Financial income and expenses**

Financial income consists of interest income on invested funds, dividend income, and gains on changes in value
of financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss.

Dividend income is recognized when the right to receive dividends has been established.

Financial expenses consist of interest charged on loans, and the effect of unwinding the present value of
provisions.

Foreign exchange gains and foreign exchange losses are recognized net.

**Combined financial statements of Assemblin Group for financial years 2019, 2018 and 2017**

**Tax**

Income tax consists of current tax and deferred tax. Income tax is recognized in profit or loss for the year, except
when underlying transactions were recognized in other comprehensive income or in equity, whereupon the
appurtenant tax effect is recognized in other comprehensive income or in equity.

Current tax is tax that is to be paid or received in regards to the current year, with application of the tax rates
determined in fact or in practice on the balance sheet date. Adjustment of current tax attributable to earlier
periods also belongs to current tax.

Deferred tax is calculated using the balance-sheet method, starting from temporary differences between the
recognized and taxable values of assets and liabilities. Temporary differences are not taken into account in Group
goodwill, or for differences that arose during the initial recognition of assets and liabilities that are not business
combinations, and that at the transaction date do not impact either recognized or taxable earnings. Moreover,
temporary differences attributable to participation in subsidiaries and joint ventures that are not expected to be
cancelled within the foreseeable future are not taken into account. Measurement of deferred tax is based on how
the underlying assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. Deferred tax is calculated using
application of the tax rates and tax regulations determined in fact or in practice on the balance-sheet date.

Deferred tax assets regarding deductible temporary differences and tax loss carry-forwards are only recognized to
the extent it is likely they will be utilized. The value of deferred tax assets is reduced when it is no longer deemed
likely that they can be utilized.

Any future income tax that arises in connection with a dividend is reported on the same date as when the
dividend is recognized as a liability.

_Measurement at initial recognition_

Financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value with the addition of or less transaction expenditures
except those regarding instruments that are measured on an ongoing basis at fair value through profit or loss, for
which transaction expenditures are instead expensed as they arise. Trade receivables (without a significant
finance component) are initially measured at the transaction price established under IFRS 15.

_Classification and subsequent measurement of financial assets_

All of the Group’s financial assets, except for holdings of shares and participations and derivatives, are measured
at amortized cost. This is because they are held as part of a business model whose goal is to obtain the
contractual cash flows, while the cash flows from assets consist only of payments of principal and interest.

The Group’s holding of shares and participations is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.

_Classification and subsequent measurement of financial liabilities_

All financial liabilities except derivatives are recognized at amortized cost. Any difference between the amount
received (net after transaction costs) and the repayment amount recognized in profit or loss, is allocated over the
period of the loan using the effective interest-rate method. Financial liabilities are classified as current liabilities
if the Group does not have an unconditional right to defer payment of the liability for at least twelve months after
the balance-sheet date.

Derivatives with a negative fair value for Assemblin are recognized as derivative liabilities and measured at fair
value through profit or loss, since hedge accounting is not applied.

_Hedge accounting of derivatives, and hedge accounting_

The Group holds derivatives to hedge its foreign currency. Derivatives are initially measured at fair value. After
initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value.

**Combined financial statements of Assemblin Group for financial years 2019, 2018 and 2017**

The Group identifies certain derivatives as hedge instruments to ensure variability in the cash flow associated
with highly likely transactions arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

_New accounting principles for 2020 and going forward_

The group applies, from 1 January 2020, the simplified standards that IASB has published concerning hedge
accounting, where the underlying basis interest rates can be affected by the IBOR reform. In accordance with the
additions to IFRS 9, the presumption is that the EURIBOR based payments made on the currency interest swap
as well as on the senior secured notes are unchanged during the duration of the hedge and the group therefore can
continue to apply hedge accounting (IFRS 9.6.8.4 – 6.8.6) .

_Cash flow hedges_

When a derivative is identified as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of the changes in fair
value in the derivative is recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulates in the hedge reserve. The
effective portion of the changes in fair value in the derivative recognized in other comprehensive income is
limited to the cumulative change in fair value in the hedged item, determined on a percentage basis, from the
start of the hedge. Ineffective portions of changes in fair value in the derivative are recognized immediately in
earnings.

For the hedged forecast transactions, the accumulated amount in the hedge reserve is reclassified to earnings in
the same period(s) that the hedged anticipated cash flow impacts earnings.

If the hedged cash flow is no longer expected to arise, the amount that has accumulated in the hedge reserve is
immediately reclassified to earnings.

_Classification of financial instruments prior to 1 January 2018_

Prior to the introduction of IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018, the Group’s holdings of financial assets such as Loans and
receivables or Financial assets/liabilities were measured at fair value through profit or loss and Available-for-sale
financial assets under IAS 39. All financial liabilities were classified as other liabilities and measured at
amortized cost. For more information, refer to Note 19.

_De-recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities_

A financial asset is derecognized from the statement of financial position when the contractual rights to the cash
flow from the financial asset expire, or if Assemblin transfers the right to receive the contractual cash flows
through a transaction in which essentially all risks and benefits are transferred to the counterparty.

The Group derecognizes a financial liability from the statement of financial position when the commitments
indicated in the agreement have been extinguished, annulled, or expire. The Group also derecognizes a financial
liability when the terms of the contract are modified and the cash flows from the modified liability are materially
different. In this case, a new financial liability is recognized at fair value based on the modified conditions.

_Off-setting_

A financial asset and a financial liability are offset and recognized with a net amount in the statement of financial
position only when there exists a legal right to offset the amount, and there is an intent to settle the items with a
net amount or to simultaneously realize the asset and settle the liability.

**Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are recognized in the Group at cost less accumulated depreciation and any
impairment. The cost includes the purchase price and expenditures directly attributable to the asset for bringing it
on site and in usable condition in accordance with the purpose for which it was procured. Borrowing costs
directly attributable to purchase, construction or production of assets that takes a significant amount of time to
complete for their intended use or for sale are included in the cost. Accounting policies for impairment are shown
below.

**Combined financial statements of Assemblin Group for financial years 2019, 2018 and 2017**

**_Leased assets_**

_Policy applicable from 1 January 2019_

In accordance with the above, the Group has amended its accounting policies for leases in the cases where the
Group is lessee. The process of change is described under Amended accounting policies attributable to new or
amended IFRS.

As of 1 January 2020, the Group leases primarily premises and vehicles. Leases are recognized as rights of use
and a corresponding liability as of the date the leased asset is available for use by the Group. Lease liabilities are
initially recognized at the present value of remaining lease expenses over the term of the lease. Lease expenses
include fixed expenses and variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate. The lease term consists of
the non-cancellable period of the agreement. Lease payments have been discounted by the incremental borrowing
rate as regards leased premises, and by the implicit interest rate as regards vehicles.

When an agreement is signed, the Group judges whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or
contains, a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange
for consideration. Similarly, the value of the liability and the asset are adjusted in conjunction with a
reassessment of the lease term. This occurs in conjunction with the passing of the final cancellation date in a
previously assessed lease term, or alternately when significant events take place or when circumstances have
changed significantly within the control of the Group and impact the existing assessment of the lease term.

The Group is exposed to any future increases of variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate that are
not included in the lease liability before they enter force. When adjustments of lease payments that depend on an
index or a rate enter force, the lease liability is restated against the right-of-use asset.

Lease payments are divided between amortization of the liability an interest. The interest is recognized in profit
or loss over the term of the lease. Rights of use are normally depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter
of the useful life and the lease term. Payments for agreements of less than one year and low-value leases are
expensed on a straight-line basis in the balance sheet.

_Policy applicable before 1 January 2019_

Leases are classified either as finance leases or operating leases. Finance leases exist where the financial risks
and benefits associated with ownership are essentially transferred to the lessee. If this is not the case, it is an
operating lease.

Assets leased under finance leases are recognized as non-current assets in the statement of financial position, and
are initially measured at the lower of the lease object’s fair value and the present value of the minimal lease
expenditures when the contract was signed. The obligation to pay future lease expenses is recognized as longterm and current liabilities. The leased assets are depreciated over the useful lives of the respective assets,
whereas lease payments are recognized as interest and repayment of the liabilities.

As a rule, assets leased under operating leases are not recognized as assets in the statement of financial position,
nor do operating leases give rise to a liability.

**_Subsequent expenditures_**

Subsequent expenditures are added to the cost only if it is likely that the future financial advantages associated
with the asset will accrue to the company and if the cost can be reliably calculated. All other subsequent
expenditures are recognized as costs in the period they arise. A subsequent expenditure is added to the cost if the
expenditure relates to the replacement of identified components or parts thereof. Even in cases where new
components are created, the expenditure is added to the cost. Any unimpaired carrying amounts on replaced
components or parts of components are disposed of and expensed in conjunction with replacement. Repairs are
expensed on a running basis.

_Depreciation policies_

Depreciation occurs on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset; land is not impaired.
Leased assets are also depreciated over the estimated useful life, or the contracted lease period if it shorter.

F-33


-----

**Combined financial statements of Assemblin Group for financial years 2019, 2018 and 2017**

_Estimated useful life:_

Š machinery and other technical assets, 5–12 years

Š furniture, tools and fittings 5–10 years

The depreciation methods used, residual values and useful lives are reviewed at the end of every year.

**Intangible assets**

**_Goodwill_**

Goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units
and is tested on at least a yearly basis for impairment.

**_Other intangible assets_**

Other intangible assets acquired by the Group consist of order backlog, and are recognized at cost less
accumulated amortization (see below) and any impairments.

Costs incurred for internally generated goodwill and internally generated brands are recognized in profit or loss
for the year when the cost arises.

**_Subsequent expenditures_**

Subsequent expenditures for capitalized intangible assets are recognized as an asset in the statement of financial
position only when they increase the future financial advantages for the specific asset which they are attributable
to. All other expenditures are expensed when they arise.

**_Amortization policies_**

Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets,
provided that such useful lives are not indeterminate. The useful lives are reviewed at least yearly. Goodwill and
other intangible assets that are not yet ready for use, are reviewed for impairment on a yearly basis and
additionally as soon as indications arise showing that the asset in question has decreased in value. Intangible
assets with determinate useful lives are amortized from the date they are available for use.

_The estimated useful lives are:_

Š order backlog 1–2 years

Š capitalized development expenditure 3–5 years

**Impairment**

The Group’s recognized assets are assessed on every balance-sheet date to determine if there are indicators of
impairment.

If there is an indicator of impairment, the recoverable amount of the asset is calculated (see below). For goodwill
and intangible assets that are not yet ready for use, the recoverable amount is calculated yearly. If materially
independent cash flows cannot be determined for an individual asset, and its fair value less the cost to sell cannot
be used, the assets are grouped when testing the need for impairment at the lowest level where it is possible to
identify materially independent cash flows; this is known as a cash-generating unit.

An impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (group of units)
exceeds the recoverable amount. An impairment is recognized as a cost in profit or loss for the year. When
impairment is identified for a cash-generating unit (group of units), the impairment amount is allocated first of all
to goodwill. Subsequently, a proportional impairment is made of other assets included in the unit (group of
units).

F-34


-----

**Combined financial statements of Assemblin Group for financial years 2019, 2018 and 2017**

The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less the cost to sell and value-in-use. In calculating
value-in-use, future cash flows are discounted by a discount factor that takes into account the risk-free interest
rate and the risk associated with the specific asset.

_Reversal of impairment losses_

An impairment of assets included in the field of application for IAS 36 is reversed if there is both an indication
that impairment no longer exists, and a change has occurred in the assumptions that formed the basis for
calculating the recoverable amount. Goodwill impairment, however, is never reversed. A reversal only occurs to
the extent that the carrying amount of the asset after reversal does not exceed the carrying amount that would
have been recognized, less amortization where appropriate, if no impairment had occurred.

_Impairment of financial assets_

Reserves for expected credit losses are calculated and reported for the financial assets measured at amortized
cost, and for the financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. Reserves for credit
losses are initially calculated and reported based on twelve months of expected credit losses. If the credit risk has
significantly increased since the financial asset was first recognized, reserves for credit losses are calculated and
reported based on expected credit losses for the entire remaining life of the asset. For trade receivables that do
not contain a significant finance component, a simplified method is applied and reserves for credit losses are
calculated and reported based on expected credit losses for the entire remaining life, regardless of whether or not
the credit risk has substantially increased. Calculation of expected credit losses is primarily based on information
about historical losses for similar receivables and counterparties. The historical information is continually
evaluated and adjusted based on the current situation, and the Group’s expectations regarding future events.

_Impairment of financial instruments prior to 1 January 2018_

For 2017, the Group assessed at the end of every reporting period whether there was objective evidence that
impairment existed for a financial asset or group of financial assets. A financial asset or a group of financial
assets was impaired only if there was objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that
occurred after the initial recognition of the asset and that this event was deemed to have an impact on the
estimated future cash flows of the financial asset that could be reliably estimated.

**Payment of capital to owners**

_Dividends_

Dividends are recognized as a liability after the dividend has been approved at the Annual General Meeting.

**Employee benefits**

_Short-term benefits_

Short-term benefits for employees are calculated without discount and recognized as an expense when the related
services are received.

A provision is recognized for the anticipated cost of bonus payments when the Group has a valid legal or
informal obligation to make such payments as a result of services being received from employees and the
obligation can be reliably calculated.

_Post-employment benefits_

In defined-contribution plans, the company pays fixed fees to a separate legal entity, and has no obligation to pay
additional fees. The Group’s earnings are expensed for costs in pace with the benefits being vested.

Defined-benefit plans are plans for post-employment benefits other than defined-contribution plans. The Group’s
net obligation regarding defined benefit plans is calculated separated for each plan through an estimate of the
future benefits the employee has earned through their employment in both current and previous periods. The
Group bears the risk for the plan providing the benefits offered.

**Combined financial statements of Assemblin Group for financial years 2019, 2018 and 2017**

The net of the estimated present value of the obligations and the fair value of the plan assets is recognized in the
statement of financial position as either a provision or a long-term financial receivable.

The pension cost and pension obligation for defined-benefit pension plans are calculated annually by independent
actuaries. The discount rate is the interest rate, on the balance-sheet date, of mortgage bonds, with a tenor that
corresponds to the Group’s pension obligations. When there is no functioning market for such corporate bonds,
the market rate on government bonds with an equivalent tenor is used instead. The calculation is performed by a
qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. Moreover, the fair value of any plan assets is estimated
as of the reporting date. Net interest expenses/income on the defined-benefit obligation/asset are recognized in
profit or loss for the year under Net financial items. Net interest items are based on the interest rate that arises
when discounting the net obligation, i.e. interest rate on the obligation, plan assets, and interest rate on the effect
of any asset ceilings.

Other components are recognized in operating profit. Translation effects consist of actuarial gains and losses, the
difference between the actual return on plan assets and the sum included in net interest items, and any changes in
the effects of asset ceilings (excluding interest included in net interest items). The translation effects are
recognized in Other comprehensive income. When the calculation results in an asset for the Group, the net
carrying amount for the asset is restricted to the lower of the surplus in the plan and the asset ceiling calculated
using the discount rate.

The asset ceiling consists of the present value of the future financial benefits in the form of reduced future fees or
cash repayment. Any requirements for minimum funding are taken into account in calculating the present value
of future repayments or receipts.

Changes to or reductions in a defined-benefit plan are recognized at the earliest of the following: a) when the
change or reduction in the plan occurs; or b) when the company recognizes related restructuring costs and
termination benefits. The changes and reductions are recognized directly in profit or loss for the year.

The special employer’s contributions constitute a part of the actuarial assumptions and are therefore recognized
as part of the net obligation or asset. For reasons of simplification, the part of the special employer’s contribution
in a legal entity that is calculated based on the Pension Obligations Vesting Act is recognized as an accrued cost
instead of as a part of the net obligation or asset.

Tax on returns is recognized on an ongoing basis in profit or loss for the year for the period the tax relates to, and
is therefore not included in the liability calculation. With funded plans, the tax is charged to the return on plan
assets and is recognized in Other comprehensive income. With unfunded or partially funded plans, the tax is
charged to profit or loss for the year.

_Termination benefits_

A cost for benefits in connection with termination of personnel is recognized when the company can no longer
withdraw the offer to the employee or when the company recognizes costs for restructuring, whichever is earlier.
The benefits that are expected to be settled after twelve months are recognized at their present value. Benefits
that are not expected to be fully settled within twelve months are recognized under long-term benefits.

**Inventories**

Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The cost of inventories is based on the
first-in, first-out principle.

F-36

**Combined financial statements of Assemblin Group for financial years 2019, 2018 and 2017**

**Provisions**

A provision is distinguished from other liabilities in that there is uncertainty around the payment date or the
amount to settle the provision. A provision is recognized in the statement of financial position when there is an
existing legal or informal obligation as a result of an event that has occurred, it is probable that an outflow of
financial resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the amount can be reliably estimated.

Provisions are made with the amount that is the best estimation of what will be required to settle the existing
obligation on the balance-sheet date. Where the effect of the timing of the payment is substantial, provisions are
calculated through discounting the anticipated future cash flow at an interest rate before tax that reflects the
current market assessments of the time value of the money and, if appropriate, the risks associated with the
liability.

_Warranties_

A provision for warranties is recognized when the underlying products or services are sold. The provision is
based on historical warranty data and a comparison of potential outcomes in relation to the likelihoods associated
with each outcome.

Fulfilment warranties are included in monetary terms until the contract is surrendered to the client, which
normally occurs in connection with an approved final inspection. If the warranty covers all or most of the
contract sum, the amount of the contingency is calculated as the contract sum less the value of the completed
portion. In cases where the warranty covers only a smaller part of the contract sum, the amount of the guarantee
contract is carried as an unchanged amount up until the contract is surrendered to the client.

In connection with the surrender of the contract, a security in the form of warranties from the bank or insurance
institution is pledged for completion. In turn, the issuer of the warranty normally receives a counter obligation
from the contracting company or other Group company. Such counter obligations relating to own contracts are
not recognized as contingencies, since they contain no increased responsibility compared with the contract
commitment.

_Restructuring_

A provision for restructuring is recognized when there is an established, detailed and formal restructuring plan
and the restructuring has either begun or been publicly announced. No provision is made for future operating
costs.

_Onerous leases_

A provision for onerous leases is recognized when the anticipated benefits that the Group expects to receive from
a contract are lower than the inevitable costs for fulfilling the obligations under the contract.

**Contingent liabilities**

Information on a contingent liability is submitted when there is a possible obligation, attributable to past events,
whose existence is confirmed only by one or more uncertain future events outside the Group’s control or when
there is an obligation that is not recognized as a liability or provision owing to the fact that it is not likely an
outflow of resources will be required or cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability.

**Note 3 – Operating segments**

The Group’s operating segments are based primarily on the main operational orientation the segments have. The
following five operating segments have been identified:

Š Electricity — offers comprehensive solutions for planning, installation, service and maintenance in
electricity and automation. The operations also cover services in security and industrial servicing. A portion
of production takes place in the company’s proprietary electrical power stations.

Š Heating & sanitation — designs, installs and maintains technical systems for heating, sanitation, sprinklers,
industry, energy and cooling in all types of buildings.

Š Ventilation — specialists in construction, installation, service and maintenance of energy-smart ventilation
facilities.

Š Norway — possesses a high degree of competency in primarily electricity, heating and sanitation, and
automation.

Š Finland — operations offer services in electricity, ventilation, heating and sanitation, and in automation and
energy efficiency as well.

These segments are the primary divisions that the company’s chief operating decision maker (CEO) observes in
regards to earnings, capital requirements and cash flows.

Each operating segment has a director who drives operating activities and reports the outcome from the segment
to CEO, which they are also a part of.

The earnings, assets and liabilities of the operating segments have included directly attributable items, as well as
items that can reasonably and reliably be allocated to the segments. The internal price among the Group’s various
segments is set under the “arm’s length” principle (i.e. between parties that are independent of each other, wellinformed and with a shared interest in performing the transactions).

** The items affecting comparability includes in the Sales and administrative expenses line in the Profit or loss
and other comprehensive income. The items affecting comparability primarily relate to acquisition related
costs and integration of acquired business as well as restructuring programs and impairment of right of use
assets of SEK 43 million.

The company´s chief operating decision maker evaluates the segments’ results on amounts before and after items
affecting comparability.

The total operating expenses included in Note 4 encompass operating costs, depreciation, items affecting
comparability, and amortization.

The measure of segment profit or loss reviewed by the chief operating decision maker is segment EBITA. The
Group adopted IFRS 16 effective 1 January 2019, however management continues to measure the segments
according to IAS 17. The adjustment from the segment amount measured using IAS 17 of SEK 101 Million to
the combined amount measured using IFRS 16 of SEK 87 Million is reflected as an adjustment in Eliminations
and Other such that the combined EBITA does reflect the lease expense as required by IFRS 16. The adjustment
of SEK 101 Million is included in the caption Operating costs excluding depreciation, amortization, impairment,
and items affecting comparability. The adjustment of SEK 87 Million is included in the caption Depreciation of
property, plant and equipment and right of use assets.

See note 34 for definitions of alternative performance measures and reconciliation of total amounts.

**Overview of defined-benefit plans**

The Group has a defined-benefit plan that provides remuneration to employees when they retire. The plan relates
only to Sweden. The defined-benefit plan is exposed to actuarial risks such as life expectancy, currency, interest
rate and investment risks. The plan is preliminary attributable to men. Payments to the plan are expected to total
SEK 13.6 million (2018: 12.9, 2017: 10.9) over the next few years.

The life expectancy assumption is based on published statistics and mortality rates. The current life expectancy
on which the obligation is calculated is based on DUS14. The remaining life expectancy for a 65-year-old
woman with this life expectancy assumption is 24 years (24) and 22 years (22) for a man. The total current life
expectancy on which the obligation is calculated is 19 years (2018: 19, 2017:18).

**Alecta**

For salaried employees in Sweden, the defined-benefit pension obligations in the ITP-2 plan for retirement and
family pensions are secured through insurance with Alecta. According to a statement from the Swedish Financial
Reporting Board, this is a defined-benefit plan that covers several employees. For the financial year, the
company did not have access to such information as would make it possible to recognize this plan as a definedbenefit plan. The pension plan under ITP secured through insurance with Alecta is thus recognized as a definedcontribution plan.

The premium for the defined-benefit retirement and family pension is calculated individually and is based on
such factors as the salary, previously earned pension and expected remaining length of service. Expected
contributions in the next reporting period for ITP 2 insurance with Alecta amount to SEK 29.2 million (2018:
27). The Group’s share of the total contributions to the pension scheme is 0.07% (2018: 0.09%), while its share
of the total number of active members in the scheme is 0.06% (2018: 0.06%).

Annual fees for pension insurance contracted with Alecta totals SEK 55.5 million (2018: 51.5, 2017: 49.6).
Alecta’s surplus can be allocated to policy holders and/or the insured. The collective consolidation level consists
of the market value of Alecta’s actuarial calculations, which do not correspond with IAS 19. In the event of low
consolidation levels, one measure could be raising the contracted price for new policies and expanding existing
benefits. In the event of high consolidation levels, one measure could be introducing premium reductions. The
collective consolidation level is normally allowed to vary between 125 and 155 percent. If Alecta’s consolidation
level falls below 125 percent or rises above 155 percent, measures must be taken to enable the consolidation
level to return to the normal range. At year end, Alecta’s surplus in the form of the collective consolidation level
totaled 148 per cent (2018: 142, 2017: 154). In the event of low consolidation levels, one measure could be
raising the contracted price for new policies and expanding existing benefits. In the event of high consolidation
levels, one measure could be introducing premium reductions. The premiums to Alecta are calculated using
assumptions interest rates, life expectancy, operating costs and tax on returns from pension funds, so that the
payment of a consistent amount of premium up to the date the date of retirement is sufficient to ensure the entire,
targeted benefit, based on the insured´s current pensionable salary, is, in fact earned. There is no agreed
framework to guide the process of managing any deficit that may arise. In the first instance, losses will be
covered by Alecta´s collective consolidation capital and will thus not lead to increased costs through higher
contractual premiums. Nor are there guidelines on how surplus of deficits should be allocated in the event of
dissolution of the scheme or a company´s withdrawal from the scheme.

**Combined financial statements of Assemblin Group for financial years 2019, 2018 and 2017**

**Unrecognized deferred tax assets**

At year end, the total tax loss in the Group was SEK 310 million (2018: 245, 2017: 475), of which SEK
68 million (2018: 68, 2017: 274) was capitalized. Deferred tax on uncapitalized tax losses totaled SEK 50 million
(2018: 36, 2017: 40); this is attributable to Sweden, Norway and Finland and matures according to the table
below.

The Assemblin Group has capitalized tax loss carryforwards totaling SEK 68 million (2018: 68, 2017: 274),
containing deferred tax assets of SEK 14 million (2018: 14, 2017: 60). Capitalized tax losses are attributable to
Swedish and Finnish wholly owned subsidiaries. Based on prepared forecasts and a very strong order book, it is
the opinion of the Board of Directors that the remaining tax loss will likely be settled against future taxable gains.

**Combined financial statements of Assemblin Group for financial years 2019, 2018 and 2017**

On 1 March 2019, Assemblin VS AB acquired Värmesvets Entreprenad i Eslöv AB through a share transfer. The
company operates across the country, but with its primary focus in the Malmö region and in Jönköping and
environs, where it offers services in heating and sanitation, licensed piping and process installations for industry,
and district heating distribution. The company’s competence, primarily in district heating, and presence in the
industrial sector gives Assemblin even more breadth in an already extensive customer offering.

On 1 June 2019, Assemblin VS AB acquired all shares in Industri och Värmemontage Werme AB to increase its
market presence in the Uppsala region. The company specializes in conversion and new construction as well as
maintenance of district heating substations, gas and steam substations and conduit work for customers primarily
in energy and industrial companies. The acquisition is a part of Assemblin’s continuing strategy to increase its
presence in the industrial sector and to strengthen its competence in district heating.

On 1 June 2019, Assemblin VS AB acquired all shares in KP Svets & Smide AB, a former subsidiary of Industri
och Värmemontage Werme AB. The company specializes in cast ironwork and repairs, and collaborates to a
great extent with Industri och Värmemontage Werme AB on constructing steel and iron- work solutions for their
projects. The acquisition of the company ensures a secure partner for Assemblin as regards deliveries of welding
and ironwork solutions, which will lead to shorter turnaround times with an increase in production quality and
thus a better customer delivery throughout.

In October 2019, Assemblin AS acquired Bygg og Varme through an assets and liabilities transaction that will
mean an expanded service offering in the Oslo area.

In October 2019, Assemblin Oy acquired the cooling operations of Suomen Kylmäpiste Oy through an assets an
liabilities transaction. With cooling operations primarily in the Uusimaa region of Finland, the company
strengthens Assemblin Oy’s offering in cooling and property services.

Hagen Holding AS (now rechristened Assemblin Innlandet AS) and its three subsidiaries were acquired in
October, with 1 November 2019 as the date of possession. The company supplements existing heating and
sanitation operations in Norway, and strengthens market presence north of Oslo.

The amortization of Order backlog and Capitalized development costs is allocated to Sales and administrative
expenses.

Capitalized development costs are internally generated intangibles.

**Impairment testing of cash generating units containing goodwill**

Assessing the value of the Group’s goodwill occurs annually based on the value-in-use of the cash generating
units. The value-in-use for the respective units is based on a forecast of future cash flows. These are based on the
2020 budget and the business plans for 2021 and 2022, approved by the management and subsequently on the
business area-specific assumptions of yearly sales growth, adjusted EBITDA margin and working capital
requirements for the period from 2023 to 2024, approved by the management. These assumptions are set based
on the history of the operations, the objectives in the business plan, the competitiveness of the operations and an
assessment of future trends in the business cycle.

The most important assumptions in the analysis are future growth rate in revenue, adjusted EBITDA margin and
discount rate. These assumptions are based on the budget and on forecasts built on previous experiences as well
as internal and external sources of information. The assumptions used to extrapolate beyond the latest forecast
period are established through the company’s ability to retain its margins and grow in line with long-term market
growth/inflation, based on forecasts from central banks and similar institutions. Discount rates are established
using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM, starting from external assessments of risk-free rate, volatility, yield
requirements on equity and our finance costs for external credit facilities). Annual growth for the period after
2024 is assumed to be 2.0 per cent (2018 and 2017: 2.0). The present value of the forecast cash flows has been
calculated with a discount rate of 8.0 per cent (2018 and 2017: 9.0) before tax, based on a weighted average of
the company’s cost for externally borrowed capital and yield requirement on equity considering the specific risk
in the business. It is the company’s opinion that growth after 2024 and the discount rate will be the same for all
cash-generating units, while the cash generating units are facing the same risk profile. As of 31 December 2019,
the value-in-use exceeds the carrying amount for all units tested. Thus, there is no impairment, and no reasonable
possible changes in the material assumptions would give rise to impairment.

**Refinancing risk**

Refinancing risk related to the risk that the Group does not have sufficient funds available when these are needed
to refinance loans that fall due, or that the Group encounters difficulties in obtaining new facilities at a given
point in time. Ensuring these needs requires both a strong financial position and active measures to ensure access
to credits. The refinancing risk is managed through such measures as long-term borrowing.

**Currency risk**

Currency risk means the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates will have a negative impact on profit or loss, the
statement of financial position and cash flows. Currency risk can be divided into transaction exposure and
translation exposure. Transaction exposure consists of the net of operating and finance in and outflows in
currencies. Translation exposure consists of the net assets of the Norwegian and Finnish subsidiaries, and their
earnings in foreign currencies.

_Sensitivity analysis — currency risk – translation exposure_

An increase in the EUR/SEK exchange rate of five per cent would positively impact the Group’s equity by SEK
3.4 million (2018: 4.6), whereas a similar increase in the NOK/SEK exchange rate would positively impact
equity by SEK 2.8 million (2018: 8.0).

The Group is not exposed to any material transaction exposure while the sale and purchase in all material aspects
is made in the respectively entities functional currency.

**Interest rate risk**

Interest rate risk means the risk that changes in interest rate levels negatively impacting the Group’s net interest
items and cash flows. Interest rate exposure arises primarily as a consequence of the Group’s external interest
bearing borrowings. Derivative financial instruments such as interest rate caps were used until 2017 to manage
the interest rate risk.

**Combined financial statements of Assemblin Group for financial years 2019, 2018 and 2017**

_Sensitivity analysis — interest rate risk_

The impact of an interest rate hike of 1 percentage point at the balance sheet date on interest revenue and interest
expenses during the coming twelve-month period would total SEK 17.6 million (12.7), given the interest-bearing
assets and liabilities existing on the balance-sheet date.

**Credit risk**

_Credit risks in finance operations_

Financial credit risk arises when cash and cash equivalents are invested, and in conjunction with trading in
financial instruments. These are primarily counterparty risks in connection with receivables in banks and other
counterparties that arise when purchasing derivative financial instruments. For other financial assets, the credit
risk is assumed to correspond to the carrying amounts.

_Credit risks in trade receivables_

The risk that the Group’s or company’s customers cannot fulfil their commitments (i.e. payment is not received
from customers) constitutes a customer credit risk. The Group’s customers are subject to credit checks, in which
information about the customers’ financial position is obtained from various credit bureaus. The Group has
prepared a credit policy for how customer credits are to be managed. It indicates, for example, where decisions
are made on credit limits of various sizes, and how credits and doubtful receivables are to be managed. No
individual customer represents 10 per cent of net revenue.

**Combined financial statements of Assemblin Group for financial years 2019, 2018 and 2017**

Under IFRS 9, the Group must recognize credit losses earlier than under the rules in IAS 39. Assemblin and its
subsidiaries have historically had low levels of verified customer losses, and it is believed this will remain
unchanged in 2019 and beyond. In assessing expected credit losses, the receivables are divided into risk
according to the number of days past due. The Group’s major customers are subjected to credit checks through
credit rating agencies, and the subsidiaries carefully monitor cancelled and delayed payments. The Group
invoices customers on a rolling basis during the production period, which means that any credit losses are
detected at an early stage. Advance invoicing is also applied in cases where it is considered necessary or called
for. Trade receivables assume a large number of customers and projects in various industries and geographical
areas. Contract assets total SEK 441 million (2018: 408) and relate to revenue that has been incurred but not
invoiced. In light of the Group’s historically low levels of credit losses, the impact from the impairment model
under IFRS 9 is deemed to be insignificant.

**Note 19 – Measuring financial assets and liabilities at fair value**

Measurement at fair value contains a measurement hierarchy regarding input data for the valuations. This
measurement hierarchy is divided into three levels corresponding with the levels introduced in IFRS 13 Fair
Value Measurement.

**_The three levels consist of:_**

Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has
access to on the measurement date.

Level 2: Inputs other than the quoted prices included in Level 1, which are directly or indirectly observable for
the asset or liability. This can also relate to inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or
liability, such as interest rate levels, yield curves, volatility and multiples.

Level 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. At this level, the assumptions that market players would
make use of in pricing the asset or liability, including risk assumptions, must be taken into consideration.

**_Classification of fair value_**

Derivatives are measured under Level 2 and recognized as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.

Financial assets measured at fair value via other comprehensive income relate primarily to Elajo. Shares in Elajo
are recognized at fair value 30 (2018 and 2017: 30). The valuation is executed according to level 3, since the
valuation is based on non-observable inputs. The fair value has been calculated on the basis of a profit multiple
based on operating profit. The profit multiple is derived based on Assemblin’s experience in acquiring unlisted
installation companies. In case the profit multiple and/or operating profit increases, the fair value will also
increase.

For all other items, excluding bank borrowings, the recorded value is an approximation of the fair value, which is
why these items are not divided into levels under the measurement hierarchy. Bank borrowings and Lease
liabilities belong to Level 2. Loans to credit institutions and lease liabilities run with variable interest rates, which
means that the value of the liabilities is not affected by changes in the base rate. The Group considers that there
has also been no change in the credit margins that could materially affect the fair value of the liabilities for that
reason the recorded value is also deemed to essentially correspond to the fair values. Shareholder loans run with
fixed interest rates that are deemed to correspond to a market-based interest rate on the balance-sheet date, which
is why the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value.

**Warranty commitments**

Provisions for warranties relate to assumed expenditures in the future for rectifying errors and shortcomings
regarding concluded projects that arise during the warranty period for the projects. Provisions for warranties are
primarily attributable to projects concluded in 2017, 2018 and 2019 whose warranty period is up to five years.
The provision is based on calculations of historical warranty costs and known complaints. Further information
concerning important assessments and estimates is provided in Note 30.

**Onerous leases**

For contract assignments where it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the
expected loss is immediately recognized as a cost in its entirety. An onerous contract is a contract in which the
unavoidable costs for meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the anticipated financial benefits. In
addition, the Group also has several rental agreements for premises with long notice periods that remain unused
as a result of reorganizations. Provisions have been made for the commitment to pay rental costs over the
remainder of the contract period.

**Other provisions**

These provisions are based on individual risk evaluation and are primarily related to acquisitions and adjustments
of acquisition balances. Future close-down costs related to the closure of unprofitable branches as a result of the
profitability improvement projects last autumn are also included

this are recognized in earnings as they arise. This requires reliable calculation of project revenue and project
costs. The precondition is a properly functioning system for cost accounting, forecasting processes and project
monitoring. The forecast regarding the project’s final outcome is a critical judgement that is material to the
operating report over the course of the project. There may be a risk that the final result as regards the project
could deviate from what is recognized over time.

**Pensions**

Assemblin has partial defined-benefit pension plans. The pension obligations are calculated using actuarial
assumptions, and plan assets are marked to market on the balance-sheet date. A change in any of these
assumptions and measurements could have a significant impact on calculated pension commitments and pension
costs.

**Warranty provisions**

In the Assemblin Group, warranty provisions are made for the warranty obligations found in the construction
contracts being performed. A warranty expenditure arises in a project when a Group company performs
additional work as a result of shortcomings that emerged in the original contract, in work performed or in
materials. A warranty reserve is calculated based on the probable costs of correcting the faults that arose in the
contract. The scope of the warranty provision is established based on:

(a) previous experiences in similar projects;

(b) the anticipated scope of the extra work; and

(c) the estimated cost.

**Onerous contract**

When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is immediately
recognized as an expense in its entirety. An onerous contract is a contract in which the unavoidable costs for
meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the anticipated financial benefits. The expected loss is
immediately recognized as a cost in its entirety.
