Prospective purchasers who are QIBs are hereby notified that the seller of the securities offered under the
Offering Memorandum may be relying on the exemption from the provisions of section 5 of the Securities Act
provided by Rule 144A.

You are reminded that the Offering Memorandum has been delivered to you on the basis that you are a person
into whose possession the Offering Memorandum may be lawfully delivered in accordance with the laws of the
jurisdiction in which you are located and you may not, nor are you authorized to, deliver the Offering
Memorandum to any other person.

Under no circumstances shall the Offering Memorandum constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer
to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale
would be unlawful. If a jurisdiction requires that the offering be made by a licensed broker or dealer and the
Initial Purchasers (as defined herein) or any affiliate of the Initial Purchasers is a licensed broker or dealer in
that jurisdiction, the offering shall be deemed to be made by the Initial Purchasers or such affiliate on behalf of
the Issuer in such jurisdiction.

The Offering Memorandum has been sent to you in an electronic form. You are reminded that documents
transmitted via this medium may be altered or changed during the process of electronic transmission and
consequently none of the Initial Purchasers, the Issuer or any person who controls them or any of their respective
directors, officers, employees or agents accepts any liability or responsibility whatsoever in respect of any
difference between the Offering Memorandum distributed to you in electronic format and the hard copy version
available to you from the Initial Purchasers upon your request.

The Offering Memorandum has not been approved for the purposes of Section 21 of the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) by an authorized person under FSMA. In the United Kingdom, the attached
Offering Memorandum and any other material in relation to the securities described therein are being distributed
only to, and are directed only at, persons who are “qualified investors” (as defined in Article 2 of the UK
Prospectus Regulation) who are (i) persons having professional experience in matters relating to investments
falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005
(the “Financial Promotion Order”), or (ii) high net worth entities falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) of the
Financial Promotion Order, or (iii) persons to whom it would otherwise be lawful to distribute them, all such
persons together being referred to as “Relevant Persons.” The securities are only available to, and any invitation,
offer or agreement to subscribe, purchase or otherwise acquire such securities will be engaged in only with,
Relevant Persons. The Offering Memorandum and its contents are confidential and should not be distributed,
published or reproduced (in whole or in part) or disclosed by any recipients to any other person in the United
Kingdom. Any person in the United Kingdom that is not a Relevant Person should not act or rely on the Offering
Memorandum or its contents.


-----

No person may communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in
investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue
or sale of the securities other than in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the
Issuer (as defined herein). Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target
market assessment in respect of the securities has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the
securities is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as
amended, “MiFID II”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the securities to eligible counterparties and
professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the securities
(a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a
distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the
securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining
appropriate distribution channels.

The Notes described in the Offering Memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made
available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For
these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point
(11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended,
the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as
defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus
Regulation. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as
amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the securities described in the Offering
Memorandum or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore
offering or selling the securities described in the Offering Memorandum or otherwise making them available to
any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation. The Offering Memorandum has
been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in any Member State will be made pursuant to an
exemption under Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the Notes.
The Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold
or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (“UK”). For these purposes, a retail
investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of
Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; (ii) a customer within
the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement
Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8)
of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii)
not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the UK Prospectus Regulation. Consequently, no key
information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of
the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available
to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making
them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

The Offering Memorandum has been addressed to you in an electronic form. You are reminded that documents
transmitted electronically may be altered or changed during the process of electronic transmission and
consequently none of the Initial Purchasers, any person who controls any Initial Purchaser, or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees or agents accepts any liability or responsibility whatsoever in respect
of any difference between the Offering Memorandum accessed by you in electronic format and any version that
will be provided to you at a later date.

deemed to have occurred if a specified consolidated net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such event. See “Description of the Notes” for

including the Issuer’s obligations under the Existing Notes and the Super Senior Facilities (both as defined herein). On the Issue Date, the Notes will not be
guaranteed. Within (i) 90 days following the Issue Date, subject to certain agreed security principles, the obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Notes will
be guaranteed, jointly and severally on a senior basis, by each subsidiary of the Issuer that will be a guarantor under the Super Senior Facilities (other than
the Subsequent Post-Closing Date Guarantors (as defined herein) and (ii) the later of (a) 90 days following the Issue Date and (b) 30 days following Crayfish

On the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured by the Issue Date Collateral (as defined herein). Within (i) 90 days of the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured
by the Initial Post-Closing Collateral (as defined herein) and (ii) the later of (a) 90 days following the Issue Date and (b) 30 days following Crayfish BidCo

Companies Act, the Notes will be secured by the Subsequent Post-Closing Collateral (as defined herein). Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement,

proceeds from the Collateral only after the Super Senior Facilities, certain hedging obligations and certain other indebtedness permitted to be incurred on a
priority basis under the Indenture, if any, have been repaid in full. The validity, enforceability and, in respect of the security interests over the Collateral,
priority and ranking of the Notes Guarantees and the security interests and the liability of the Guarantors, are subject to the limitations described in “Certain
_Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests.” The Notes will be_
structurally subordinated to all obligations of the Issuer’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes and effectively subordinated to any existing and future
debt of the Issuer and the Guarantors that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of such property and assets.

listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”). There can be no assurance,
however, that the Notes will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the Notes will be granted or that such
listing will be maintained. The Exchange is not a regulated market pursuant to the provisions of Directive 2004/39/EC on markets in financial
instruments, as amended, or Article 2(1)(13A) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union
(Withdrawal) Act 2018.

###### NOTICE TO CERTAIN EUROPEAN INVESTORS

**PRIIPs Regulation/Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors. The Notes are not intended to be offered,**
sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail
investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or both) of: (i) a retail
client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); or (ii) a
customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II.
Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs
**Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA**
has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail
investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. This offering memorandum has been
prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in any Member State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an
exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the “Prospectus Regulation”) from the requirement to publish
a prospectus for offers of the Notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the
Prospectus Regulation.

**MiFID II Product Governance/Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market.** Solely for the
purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes,
has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and professional
clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible
counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or
recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration each manufacturer’s target market
assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market
assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining each manufacturer’s target market assessment)
and determining appropriate distribution channels.

###### United Kingdom

**Prohibition of Sales to UK Retail Investors. The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made**
available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United
Kingdom (“UK”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail
client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by
virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of the
provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU)
2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1)
of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently no key
information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of
the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available

to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making
them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

**UK MiFIR Product Governance / Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market. Solely for the**
purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes
has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined in
the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in
Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal)
Act 2018 (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and
professional clients are appropriate. Any distributor should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target
market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product
Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its
own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target
market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

###### PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER DATA

 The Group

Prior to May 3, 2023, the Group’s historical financial information was consolidated at the level of Assemblin
Financing AB. On May 3, 2023, the newly formed Assemblin Group AB (publ) (formerly known as Apollo
Swedish Bidco AB (publ)) acquired Assemblin Financing AB (the “Assemblin Financing Acquisition”) and
became the reporting entity for the Group for accounting purposes. The acquisition was a part of a larger transfer
of holdings from Triton IV to Triton IV Continuation Fund. In connection with the change of ownership,
Assemblin Group AB (publ) was deemed to be the acquiror from an accounting perspective, resulting in a new
group being formed for accounting purposes. Following the Caverion Combination (as defined in “Summary—
_The Transactions—Caverion Combination), on April 1, 2024 Assemblin Group AB (publ) was renamed_
Assemblin Caverion Group AB (publ) (the “Issuer”). Due to these perimeter changes and the change of control,
the historical financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum for the periods prior to May 3, 2023
is for the Assemblin Financing Group (as defined below) and cannot be considered comparable to financial
information presented for the periods between May 3, 2023 and April 1, 2024 for the Assemblin Group (as
defined below).

Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, as used in this offering memorandum, the
“Group,” “Assemblin,” “our,” “we” or “us,” means, (i) on or prior to May 2, 2023, in the context of the
historical financial information and other operational data, the group of entities comprising Assemblin
Financing AB and its consolidated subsidiaries, (ii) on or after May 3, 2023 and up to April 1, 2024, in the
context of the historical financial information and other operational data, the group of entities comprising the
Issuer (formerly known as Assemblin Group AB (publ)) and its consolidated subsidiaries (for the avoidance of
doubt, excluding the Caverion Group) and (iii) on or afterApril 1, 2024, the Issuer and its subsidiaries, including
the Caverion Group. These periods are not directly comparable as they represent levels of consolidation under
different entities that were not under common control across the periods. References to the “Assemblin
**Financing Group” are to Assemblin Financing AB and its consolidated subsidiaries and references to the**
“Assemblin Group” are to the Issuer (formerly known as Assemblin Group AB (publ)) and its consolidated
subsidiaries prior to April 1, 2024 (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding the Caverion Group).

We have included the below table as a simplified explanation of the defined terms that are used in this
“Presentation of Financial and other Data” and elsewhere in this offering memorandum, for the benefit of
investors. The below table does not contain all of the information that you should consider before investing in

**Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements”);**

The historical consolidated financial information for the Assemblin Financing Group and the Assemblin Group

condensed consolidated interim financial information for Assemblin Financing Group for the period 1 January

In addition, this offering memorandum includes certain non-IFRS financial information on an aggregated basis,
which is derived by adding together the relevant line item from the Assemblin Financing Group Unaudited
Condensed Consolidated Four-Month Financial Information with the corresponding line item from the
Assemblin Group Audited Consolidated Eight-Month Financial Statements (the “2023 Aggregated Total
**Financial Information”). The period covering the 2023 Aggregated Total Financial Information is the “2023**
**Aggregated Total.” The 2023 Aggregated Total Financial Information has not been prepared pursuant to IFRS**
since it is an aggregation of consolidated financial information from two different groups (the Assemblin
Financing Group and the Assemblin Group, which were not under common control during the periods
aggregated) and, consequently, the aggregated amounts may not represent, and are not intended to represent,
the results that would have been achieved if the companies were under common control during relevant periods.
The 2023 Aggregated Total Financial Information has not been audited or reviewed by our independent auditors
or any third party. The 2023 Aggregated Total Financial Information is presented for informational purposes
only. It does not represent a full annual period, or the results that would have been achieved if the entities were
under common control during the period of time, and is presented solely to assist prospective investors in
assessing the comparability of the results of operations for the financial year ended December 31, 2023, by
presenting such position as the 2023 Aggregated Total, with the periods prior to the change in scope of
consolidation.

In this offering memorandum, we include unaudited pro forma financial information for (i) the three months
ended March 31, 2024 and (ii) the year ended December 31, 2023, together with related explanatory notes
(collectively, the “Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information”), and (iii) the three months ended March
31, 2023 and (iv) the last twelve months ended March 31, 2024 (collectively, the “Unaudited Pro Forma
**Financial Other Information”). See “Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information” and “Unaudited Pro**
_Forma Financial Other Information.”_

The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information and the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Other Information has
been prepared to illustrate the hypothetical effects that the Assemblin Financing Acquisition and Caverion
Combination might have had on the Issuer’s:

i. unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of financial position as of March 31, 2024 as

ii. unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of profit or loss for the three-months ended

the three-months ended March 31, 2024 and the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated
statement of profit or loss for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 as if the Assemblin Financing
Acquisition and the Caverion Combination occurred on January 1, 2023.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information and the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Other Information
included herein is not necessarily indicative of what the unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of financial
position or the unaudited pro forma consolidated or unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of
profit or loss of the Issuer would have been if the Assemblin Financing Acquisition and the Caverion
Combination had been completed as of the dates indicated, nor do they purport to project the future consolidated
financial position or consolidated profit of the Issuer. The actual consolidated financial position and
consolidated profit may differ significantly from the pro forma amounts reflected herein due to a variety of
factors. The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information and the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Other
Information is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect the costs of any integration activities
or cost savings or synergies that may be achieved as a result of the Assemblin Financing Acquisition and the
Caverion Combination (although our Pro Forma Adjusted Run-Rate EBITDA included in the Pro Forma
Adjusted and as adjusted Non-IFRS Information (as defined below) does reflect our estimates of such synergies
and cost savings).

The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information and the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Other Information
reflects transaction accounting adjustments management believes are necessary to demonstrate the potential
effects that the Assemblin Financing Acquisition and the Caverion Combination might have had on the
unaudited pro forma consolidated or unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of profit or loss
and unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of financial position of the Issuer following these
acquisitions as of and for the period indicated. The transaction-related adjustments are based on currently
available information and assumptions that management believes are, under the circumstances and given the
information available at this time, reasonable, and reflective of adjustments necessary to report the consolidated
statement of financial position and consolidated statement of profit and loss as if the Assemblin Financing
Acquisition and the Caverion Combination were completed on assumed dates.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information and the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Other Information has
been prepared to illustrate the hypothetical effects of the Assemblin Financing Acquisition and the Caverion
Combination and does not necessarily reflect other impacts like potential variations related to purchase price
allocation (“PPA”) following these acquisitions. Certain PPA adjustments or application of associated
accounting rules could result in different carrying values for existing assets and can influence amortization and
depreciation expenses and may lead to considerable variances in our future consolidated financial statements.

A PPA of the Caverion Combination has been prepared applying IFRS 3 “Business Combination.” In the
preliminary PPA, the allocation of identifiable assets and liabilities is measured at fair value. The difference
between the consideration and the Caverion Group’s identifiable assets and liabilities including acquisitionrelated intangible assets is recognized as goodwill in the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement
of financial position. Goodwill is not subject to amortization but will be tested yearly for impairment or when
there is an indication of impairment. Acquisition-related intangible assets have been identified in the
preliminary PPA relating to order back log, brand and other acquisition related intangible assets. The estimated
useful life for a large proportion of the order back log is two years and a minor proportion of the order back log
has an estimated longer useful life. Brand has an estimated indefinite useful life. The PPA is expected to be
finalized no later than December 31, 2024.

The Caverion Financial Statements are stated in Euros. For purposes of the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial
Information and the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Other Information, such financial statements have been
converted into SEK using (i) the Central Bank of Sweden closing rate as of March 31, 2024 (€1.00 to SEK
11.525) for balance sheet items, (ii) the Central Bank of Sweden average exchange rate for the period between

January 1, 2024 and March 31, 2024 (€1.00 to SEK 11.279) for the income statement for the three months
ended March 31, 2024, (iii) the Central Bank of Sweden average exchange rate for the period between January
1, 2023 and December 31, 2023 (€1.00 to SEK 11.477) for the income statement for the year ended December
31, 2023 and (iv) the Central Bank of Sweden average exchange rate for the period between January 1, 2023
and March 31, 2023 (€1.00 to SEK 11.097) for the income statement for the three months ended March 31,
2023 and (v) the Central Bank of Sweden average exchange rate for the period between January 1, 2023 and
March 31, 2024 (€1.00 to SEK 11.498) for the income statement for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information and the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Other Information has
not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the U.S. Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, the regulation of the European Union (EU) 2017/1129, U.S. GAAP or IFRS. Neither the
adjustments nor the resulting pro forma financial information have been audited or reviewed in accordance with
any generally accepted auditing standards. The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information and the Unaudited
Pro Forma Financial Other Information should be read in conjunction with the historical condensed
consolidated and consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of the Issuer, Assemblin Financing and
Caverion included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Assemblin”,_ _“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of_
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Caverion”, “Risk Factors—Anticipated pro forma adjustments_
_to our financial information may not materialize as anticipated” and “Risk Factors—The Unaudited Pro Forma_
_Financial Information included in the offering memorandum is subject to significant limitations and may differ_
_significantly from the actual performance of the Combined Group.”_

###### Pro Forma Adjusted and as adjusted Non-IFRS Information

In this offering memorandum we have prepared certain unaudited Non-IFRS financial information to give pro
forma effect, as applicable, to: (i) the Assemblin Financing Acquisition and the Caverion Combination as if
they had occurred on January 1, 2023; (ii) the impact of certain acquisitions by Assemblin and Caverion that
were completed prior to March 31, 2024 and cost synergies expected to be realized in connection with the
Caverion Combination, all as if they had occurred or been completed on April 1, 2023; and (iii) the Transactions
as if they had occurred on March 31, 2024 (the “Pro Forma Adjusted and as adjusted Non-IFRS
**Information”). Such Pro Forma Adjusted and as adjusted Non-IFRS Information may include various other**
adjustments, as described herein. The Pro Forma Adjusted and as adjusted Non-IFRS Information have been
prepared on the basis of historical financial information included in the Financial Statements and/or elsewhere
in this Offering Memorandum, as well as accounting records of Assemblin and the Caverion Group, and
management estimates.

###### Combined Group Data

We also present in this offering memorandum certain financial and other operating data that management has
prepared on a “combined group” basis, which is derived by adding historical financial and other data derived
from the historical consolidated financial information for the Assemblin Financing Group and the Assemblin
Group, management accounts and systems to the equivalent data of the Caverion Group derived from the
Caverion Financial Statements, management accounts and systems for the relevant period (the “Combined
**Group Data”). References to the “Combined Group” are to Assemblin prior to April 1, 2024 together with**
the Caverion Group, as if the Caverion Combination had already taken place. The Combined Group Data is not
prepared pursuant to IFRS since it is an aggregation of consolidated financial information from different groups
(the Assemblin Financing Group, the Assemblin Group and the Caverion Group, which were not under common
control during the periods aggregated) and, consequently, the aggregated amounts may not represent, and are
not intended to represent, the results that would have been achieved if the companies were under common
control during relevant periods. The Combined Group Data is not to be mistaken for or conflated with the
Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information and there have been no pro forma adjustments to the Combined

Group Data. The Combined Group Data included herein has not been audited, reviewed or verified by any
independent auditors and does not adjust for differences in how line items are calculated or accounted for by
the Assemblin Financing Group or the Assemblin Group compared to the Caverion Group. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to the Caverion Combination—The Combined Group Data included in the offering memorandum_
_is subject to significant limitations and may differ significantly from the actual performance of the Combined_
_Group.” The Combined Group Data presents certain financial and operational information by segments which_
do not yet exist for the Group in order to illustrate how results may be broken down on a Combined Group
basis. The Assemblin Group currently reports its financial and operational results broken down by the following
business areas: Assemblin Electrical, Assemblin H&S, Assemblin Ventilation, Assemblin Finland and
Assemblin Norway. The Caverion Group reports its financial and operational results broken down by the
following divisions: Sweden, Finland, Germany, Norway, Industry, Austria, Denmark and Other countries
(comprised of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania). In this offering memorandum we present Combined Group data
for the following illustrative segments: Sweden (comprised of Assemblin Electrical, Assemblin H&S,
Assemblin Ventilation and Caverion’s Sweden division), Norway (comprised of Assemblin Norway and
Caverion’s Norway division), DK + DACH (comprised of Caverion’s Denmark, Germany and Austria
divisions) and Finland + Fidelix (comprised of Assemblin Finland and Caverion’s Finland, Baltics and
Industry divisions).

The offering memorandum includes the following non-IFRS Combined Group Data:

  - “Combined Group Net revenue” means the aggregate of the net revenue from Assemblin together
with the net revenue from the Caverion Group, without any adjustments or eliminations;

  - “Combined Group EBITDA” means the aggregate of the EBITDA from the Assemblin Group
together with the EBITDA from the Caverion Group, without any adjustments or eliminations;

  - “Combined Group Assets” means the aggregate of the assets of the Assemblin Group together with
the assets of the Caverion Group, without any adjustments or eliminations;

  - “Combined Group Adjusted EBITA” means the aggregate of the Assemblin Adjusted EBITA
together with the Caverion Adjusted EBITA, without any adjustments or eliminations;

  - “Combined Group Adjusted EBITA Margin” means the aggregate of the Combined Group
Adjusted EBITA divided by Combine Group Net revenue for the period, expressed as a percentage;

  - “Combined Group Order backlog” means the aggregate of the order backlog of the Assemblin
Group and order backlog of the Caverion Group as defined by the respective groups;

  - “Combined Group Order intake” means the aggregate of the order intake of the Assemblin Group
and order intake of the Caverion Group as defined by the respective groups; and

  - “Combined Group Net Tangible Non-lease Expenditures” means the aggregate of the Non-lease
tangible net capital expenditures in the definitions of Assemblin Adjusted Free Cash Flow and
Caverion Adjusted Free Cash Flow.

The Combined Group Data presented in this offering memorandum does not purport to project our results of
operations for any future period or our financial condition at any future date and is not reflective of actual
results. The Combined Group Data has only been presented for certain illustrative segments and, as such, the
sum of these segments may not equal the sum of the relevant metric when extracted independently from the
historical financial and other data derived from the historical consolidated financial information for the
Assemblin Financing Group and the Assemblin Group, on the one hand and the Caverion Group, on the other
hand.

###### Aggregated LTM Total or LTM Data

Historical financial information, unaudited income statement information and other financial information is
provided in this offering memorandum for Assemblin for the period derived by subtracting, from the 2023
Aggregated Total Financial Information, the parallel financial information of the Assemblin Financing Group
Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements and adding the financial information of the
Assemblin Group Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements (the “Aggregated LTM
**Total”).**

In addition, historical financial information, unaudited income statement information and other financial
information is provided in this offering memorandum for the last twelve months ended March 31, 2024 (“the
**twelve months ended March 31, 2024” or “LTM”), which have been calculated by subtracting from the**
financial information for the year ended December 31, 2023 the equivalent financial information for the three
months ended March 31, 2023 and adding the equivalent financial information for the three months ended
March 31, 2024.

The information for the Aggregated LTM Total and the LTM period has not been prepared pursuant to IFRS
since it is an aggregation of consolidated financial information from different groups (the Assemblin Financing
Group, the Assemblin Group and/or the Caverion Group, as the case may be, which were not under common
control during the periods aggregated) and, consequently, the aggregated amounts may not represent, and are
not intended to represent, the results that would have been achieved if the companies were under common
control during relevant periods. The information for the Aggregated LTM Total and the LTM has not been
audited or reviewed by our independent auditors or any third party and has been prepared for illustrative
purposes only and are not necessarily representative of the results of operations for any future period or the
financial condition at any future date. This data has been prepared solely for the purpose of this offering
memorandum and is not prepared in the ordinary course of Assemblin’s or Caverion’s financial reporting.

###### Differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP

The historical consolidated financial information for the Assemblin Financing Group and the Assemblin Group
and Caverion Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU. The information
included in this offering memorandum was not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the Unites States (“U.S. GAAP”). There could be significant differences between IFRS, as applied
by us, and U.S. GAAP. We neither describe the differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP nor reconcile our
IFRS financial statements to U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, such information is not available to investors, and
investors should consider this in making their investment decision. The financial information included in this
offering memorandum would require the modification, reformulation or exclusion of certain financial measures.
In addition, changes would be required in the presentation of certain other information.

The financial information included in this offering memorandum is not intended to comply with the applicable
accounting requirements of the Securities Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC, including SEC
Regulation S-X, which would apply if the Notes were being registered with the SEC.

###### Non-IFRS Measures

We present Assemblin EBITA, Assemblin Adjusted EBITA, Assemblin Adjusted EBITDA, Caverion EBITA,
Caverion Adjusted EBITA, Caverion Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma EBITA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITA, Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA and other non-IFRS measures referred to
above because we believe they assist investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting
periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating
performance.

The foregoing measures have limitations as analytical tools. Some of these limitations are:

- they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual
commitments;

- they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

- they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service interest
or principal payments on our debt;

- although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized
will often need to be replaced in the future and Assemblin Adjusted EBITDA, Caverion Adjusted
EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA and similar nonIFRS financial measures do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such
replacements;

- some of the large and unusual expenses we eliminate in calculating Assemblin EBITA, Assemblin
Adjusted EBITA, Assemblin Adjusted EBITDA, Caverion EBITA, Caverion Adjusted EBITA, Caverion

xxiv


-----

Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma EBITA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and
Pro Forma Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA and similar non-IFRS financial measures reflect cash payments
that were made; and

- the fact that other companies in our industry may calculate Assemblin EBITA, Assemblin Adjusted
EBITA, Assemblin Adjusted EBITDA, Caverion EBITA, Caverion Adjusted EBITA, Caverion Adjusted
EBITDA, Pro Forma EBITA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma
Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA and similar non-IFRS financial measures differently than we do, which
limits their usefulness as comparative measures.

We present Assemblin EBITA, Assemblin Adjusted EBITA, Assemblin Adjusted EBITDA, Caverion EBITA,
Caverion Adjusted EBITA, Caverion Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma EBITA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITA, Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA and other non-IFRS measures as we
believe they will be useful to investors and analysts in reviewing our performance and comparing our results to
other operators. However, neither Assemblin EBITA, Assemblin Adjusted EBITA, Assemblin Adjusted
EBITDA, Caverion EBITA, Caverion Adjusted EBITA, Caverion Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma EBITA, Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted Run-rate EBITDAnor the other
non-IFRS measures are IFRS measures and you are encouraged to evaluate any adjustments to IFRS measures
yourself and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. You should not consider
Assemblin EBITA, Assemblin Adjusted EBITA, Assemblin Adjusted EBITDA, Caverion EBITA, Caverion
Adjusted EBITA, Caverion Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma EBITA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITA, Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA (a) as an alternative to operating profit/loss as a
measure of our operating performance; (b) as an alternative to cash flow from operating and investment
activities as a measure of our ability to meet cash needs; or (c) as an alternative to any other measure of
performance under IFRS. Because of these limitations, as well as further limitations discussed above, the nonIFRS measures presented should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures
calculated in accordance with IFRS. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our results in
accordance with IFRS and using non-IFRS measures only supplementally.

###### INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA

Unless otherwise indicated, statements in this offering memorandum regarding the market environment, market
developments, growth rates, market trends and the competitive situation in the markets and segments in which
we operate are based on data, statistical information, sector reports and studies as well as on our own estimates.

In preparing this offering memorandum, we used industry sources and sources on market data, including reports
prepared by an independent third-party consultant and Prognoscentret AB (“Prognoscentret”).

To the extent that information was taken from third parties, such information has been accurately reproduced
by us in this offering memorandum and, as far as we are aware and able to ascertain from the information
published by these third parties, no facts have been omitted which would render the reproduced information
inaccurate or misleading. However, market studies and analyses are frequently based on information and
assumptions that may not be accurate or technically correct, and their methodology may be forward-looking
and speculative.

For our market position in the Nordic countries where we operate (Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark)
and in the Northern European countries in which we operate (comprised of Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark,
Germany and Austria), we have calculated this based on our analysis of Combined Group revenues and publicly
reported revenues for relevant peers the year ended December 31, 2023 (and the year ended December 31, 2022,
where publicly reported revenues for relevant peers for the year ended December 31, 2023 are not available).
We have conservatively estimated total revenues in the Northern European countries in which we operate for
top market players when only partial geographic disclosures of revenues are publicly available. Additionally,
our analysis has included the revenues from recent acquisitions completed by our largest competitors. For our
market position in Germany and Austria, this is based on an independent third party consultant’s analysis of
Caverion revenue and reported revenue of relevant peers for the year ended December 31, 2021.

We have not verified the figures, market data and other information used by third parties in the studies,
publications and financial information reproduced herein, or the external sources on which our estimates are
based. We therefore assume no liability for and offer no guarantee of the accuracy of the data from studies and
third-party sources contained in this offering memorandum or for the accuracy of third-party data on which our
estimates are based.

This offering memorandum also contains estimates of market data and information derived from such data that
cannot be obtained from publications by independent sources. Such information is partly based on our own
market observations, the evaluation of industry information (such as from conferences and sector events) or
internal assessments. We believe that our estimates of market data and the information we have derived from
such data helps investors to better understand the industry in which we operate and our position within it. Our
own estimates have not been checked or verified externally. While we assume that our own market observations
are reliable, we give no warranty for the accuracy of our own estimates and the information derived from them.
They may differ from estimates made by our competitors or from other independent sources. While we are not
aware of any misstatements regarding the industry or similar data presented herein, such data involves risks and
uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, including those discussed under the heading
“Risk Factors” in this offering memorandum. As a result, neither we nor the Initial Purchasers make any
representation as to the accuracy or completeness of any such information in this offering memorandum.

###### EXCHANGE RATES

The following tables set forth, for the periods set forth below, the high, low, average and period end Bloomberg
Generic Composite Rates expressed as Swedish krona per €1.00. The Bloomberg Generic Composite Rate is a
“best market” calculation, in which, at any point in time, the bid rate is equal to the highest bid rate of all
contributing bank indications and the ask rate is set to the lowest ask rate offered by these banks. The Bloomberg
Generic Composite Rate is a mid-value rate between the applied highest bid rate and the lowest ask rate. The
rates may differ from the actual rates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and other
financial information appearing in this offering memorandum. None of the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Initial
Purchasers represent that the Swedish krona or euro amounts referred to below could be or could have been
converted into Swedish krona or euros at any particular rate indicated or any other rate.

The average rate for a year, a month or for any shorter period, means the average of the daily Bloomberg Generic
Composite Rates during that year, month or shorter period, as the case may be. On June 7, 2024, the Bloomberg
Generic Composite Rate between the euro and the Swedish krona was SEK 11.3844 per €1.00.

###### Overview

We are one of the Nordic region’s leading providers of smart and sustainable installation and service solutions,
with our primary activities focusing on electrical engineering, heating & sanitation, ventilation and smart
buildings & automation, such as building management systems (“BMS”) and individual metering and debiting
(“IMD”), as well as key competencies in data & telecoms, industrial pipes, district heating, cooling, sprinklers,
security and green technology solutions (“GreenTech”). In April 2024 we completed our combination with
Caverion, one of Europe’s leading providers of technical solutions for buildings and industries in Finland,
Sweden, Germany, Norway, Austria and the Baltics, which has increased our capabilities in smart and
sustainable solutions and expanded our geographic scope of operations.

We hold a strong position in the growing installation market in the Nordic countries in which we operate
(comprising Sweden, Norway and Finland). With the Caverion Combination (as defined in _“—The_
_Transactions—The Caverion Combination”) we now also have a presence in Denmark, Germany, Austria, the_
Baltics (comprised of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) and Poland. The Nordic countries in which the Combined
Group operates (comprising Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland) are estimated to have had an installation
and services market value of SEK 350 billion in the year ended December 31, 2023, according to
Prognosesenteret, whilst the Austrian and German markets were estimated to have had a combined value of
€214 billion in the year ended December 31, 2023, according to an independent third party consultant. Our

1


-----

multi-technical offering, market share and size have enhanced our position as an experienced and trusted partner
that provides reliable and efficient high-quality services in the context of an ongoing transformation towards a
more energy-efficient and sustainable society.

We provide design, installation, maintenance and service solutions for a wide range of properties, industrial
facilities and infrastructure projects for a diverse customer base consisting of over 76,000 large and small
customers on a Combined Group basis, which include construction companies, the public sector, property
owners and industrial companies. Our installation business consists of the installation of technical systems as
part of the construction of new properties and the renovation or upgrade of technical systems as part of the
reconstruction and renovation of properties, improving their functionality and comfort. Our design and
maintenance capabilities complement our installation business. Lastly, our service business consists of the
operation, maintenance, repair, replacement, reconfiguration and monitoring of technical installations in
buildings, industrial plants and infrastructure. Our strong relationships with our customers have contributed
to a Combined Group Order backlog of SEK 32,713 million as of March 31, 2024, with more than 1,100
ongoing projects as of March 31, 2024 on a Combined Group basis. We take on primarily two types of
assignments: contractor assignments (which include new construction projects and major renovations) and
service assignments (which include service, maintenance and minor renovation assignments). Contractor
assignments and service assignments represented 43 per cent. and 57 per cent., respectively, of our Combined
Group Net revenue for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024.

Our operations are decentralized and governed based on a shared framework, clear allocation of roles and
responsibilities and systematic monitoring. Before the Caverion Combination, Assemblin’s operating
organization was divided into five specific business areas: three in Sweden (Assemblin Electrical, Assemblin
H&S and Assemblin Ventilation), one in Norway (Assemblin Norway) and one in Finland, which also includes
BMS products and IMD operations in Sweden and Norway (Assemblin Finland), comprising approximately
189 units (which are the physical branches) with 7,077 FTE employees in the Nordic region as of March 31,
2024. With the Caverion Combination, we have added 178 units with 14,380 FTE employees in total, as of
March 31, 2024, and we expect to restructure our operations into four segments: Sweden (comprised of
Assemblin Electrical, Assemblin H&S and Assemblin Ventilation and Caverion’s Sweden division), Norway
(comprised of Assemblin Norway and Caverion’s Norway division), DK + DACH (comprised of Caverion’s
Denmark, Germany and Austria divisions) and Finland + Fidelix (comprised of Assemblin Finland and
Caverion’s Finland, Baltics and Industry divisions). We believe that our decentralized business model
contributes to the profitability of our operations. This decentralized and entrepreneurial business model allows
us to swiftly adjust to a largely variable cost structure and promotes enterprise and accountability at all levels
of our structure, with the president of each business area being responsible for managing the operations and
earnings of the respective business areas.

The following map represents the locations in which the Combined Group operated as of March 31, 2024.

Assemblin has been owned by Triton since 2015, and since then we have expanded our geographical presence
and volumes through the acquisition of 80 additional companies to date excluding Caverion (45 of which were
since January 1, 2021). Between January 1, 2021 and December 31, 2023, the Caverion Group completed 25
acquisitions. Our organic and inorganic growth has made us into a full-service installation and service partner,
with the strength of a multidisciplinary group and the personal presence of a local company.

In the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, we had total Pro Forma Net revenue of SEK 43,079 million, a
Pro Forma loss for the period of SEK 468 million, Pro Forma EBITA of SEK 2,068 million, Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITA of SEK 2,511 million, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of SEK 3,525 million and Pro Forma Adjusted
Run-Rate EBITDA of SEK 3,733 million.

The table below sets out the Combined Group Net revenue, Combined Group Adjusted EBITA (and
corresponding margin), Combined Group Order backlog, share of service assignments, average number of
FTE employees and number of units for each of our segments as of and for the twelve months ended March
31, 2024.

###### Competitive Strengths

 The combination with Caverion has enhanced Assemblin’s scale, diversification, competitive positioning and business mix, thereby creating a business profile with significantly increased resilience

Increased scale: Assemblin’s Adjusted EBITDA for the Aggregated LTM Total, was SEK 1,359 million.
However, our Pro Forma Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA, which includes adjustments for the Caverion
Combination, for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 was SEK 3,733 million. The increased scale results
in improved competitive positioning, as explained below.

Increased diversification: On a standalone basis, of Assemblin’s Net revenues for the 2023 Aggregated Total,
71 per cent. was derived from Sweden, 15 per cent. from Finland and 15 per cent. from Norway. The Caverion
Combination not only increases diversification within the Nordics, but also adds significant presence in the
large addressable markets of Germany, Austria and the Baltics. Of the Combined Group Net revenue for the
year ended December 31, 2023, 37 per cent. was derived from Sweden, 24 per cent. from Finland, 15 per cent.
from Norway, 4 per cent. from Denmark, 12 per cent. from Germany, 7 per cent. from Austria and 1 per cent.
from the Baltics. This enhanced regional presence reduces the Combined Group’s dependence on the
macroeconomic environment in any one country.

Enhanced market leadership and geographical presence: The increased scale and diversification also results in
the Combined Group having strengthened market positions and geographical presence across a wider range of
countries relative to the standalone Assemblin Group. Based on our analysis of publicly reported revenues, on
a Combined Group basis we are the largest company in the Northern European countries in which we operate
(comprised of Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Germany and Austria), the largest company in the Nordic
countries in which we operate (comprised of Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark), the largest company in
Sweden, the largest company in Norway, the largest company in Finland and within the top five largest in
Denmark in the respective installation and services markets, in each case based on Combined Group Net
revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. For the basis of this analysis, see “Industry and Market Data.”
We were also the fifth largest in Germany and the third largest in Austria, on a Combined Group basis based
on Caverion revenue and reported revenue of relevant peers for the year ended December 31, 2021, according
to an independent third party consultant. Additionally, on a standalone basis, as of March 31, 2024, Assemblin
had 151 units in Sweden, 17 units in Finland and 23 units in Norway. On a Combined Group basis, as of March

4


-----

31, 2024, we had 194 units in Sweden, 77 units in Finland, 54 units in Norway, 9 units in Denmark, 18 units in
Germany and 13 units in Austria.

Improved business mix: Prior to the Caverion Combination, Assemblin had developed an effective model for
project bidding and execution with a smaller but growing multi-year services business. On a standalone basis,
services contributed to 42 per cent. of Assemblin’s Net revenues for the 2023 Aggregated Total (comprised of
42 per cent. for the Assemblin Financing Group for the four-month period ended May 2, 2023 and 41 per cent.
for the Assemblin Group for the eight-month period ended December 31, 2023). Caverion, on the other hand,
has had a focus on the services business, with offerings such as technical facilities management. The
combination of Assemblin and Caverion therefore brings together highly complementary businesses, with the
former having a reputation for projects and the latter possessing good standing in services. On a Combined
Group basis, the Group will have strong expertise across both projects and services, but with services
contributing to 57 per cent. of Combined Group Net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 (compared
to the installation and services market in Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark, which are comprised, as a
whole, of 77 per cent. in services and 23 per cent. in projects). This skew towards services makes the Group
highly resilient given the multi-year and recurring nature of services.

The combination with Caverion therefore significantly enhances the strength of Assemblin which has been
proven over the years through consistent EBITA and EBITA margin expansion, and high cash generation. The
strengths of the Combined Group are detailed below.

###### Exceptional scale and local density in a market with attractive and resilient growth, underpinned by stable and accelerating long-term megatrends

The Nordic installation and services market has historically shown resilience during economic downturns. For
example, the renovation and services market in the Nordics during the 2008-2009 financial crisis experienced
slow growth, rather than a decline, and the services market was only moderately impacted by the COVID-19
pandemic. Renovations and new build projects continued growing throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and the
services market suffered only a slight contraction due to the difficulty experienced by services technicians in
gaining access to work-sites and buildings due to pandemic restrictions (rather than demand-driven factors).
Similarly, during the high inflationary environment experienced from 2022 onwards, the renovation and
services markets in the Nordics have continued to grow, whilst the new build market has experienced only a
marginal contraction.

Our resilience during the recent global economic challenges has been enhanced by our significant exposure to
the services market (57 per cent. of our Combined Group Net revenue for the twelve months ended March 31,
2024) and limited exposure to new builds. Other factors that add to our resilience are our order backlog of
committed orders that allows us the planning horizon to adjust our cost base and project margins after dips in
the construction market. Moreover, diversification across different geographical regions ensures that the Group
is more resilient to economic shocks in any particular country that it operates in within Europe.

The Nordic markets in which we operate are also expected to grow, as estimated by an independent third-party
consultant, by a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 3 per cent. from 2023 to 2026, reaching a
combined approximate value of SEK 379 billion in 2026). Between 2023 and 2026, we expect the market to
experience a CAGR of 0 per cent., 5 per cent. and 3 per cent. in the new build, renovation and services segments,
respectively. The installation and services market's growth is driven by a number of positive mega-trends
driving investments in the space, which stems from ageing and energy inefficient buildings, the changing and
growing needs of the population, building upgrades with smart and sustainable solutions and sustainability goals
which will require installation and services solutions to be achieved. These trends are underlined by market
requirements, including: (i) the non-cyclical and reinforced need for renovations of the large stock of ageing
and inefficient buildings in the EU: it is estimated that as of 2019, approximately 35 per cent. of the building

5


-----

stock in the EU is over 50 years old and approximately 75 per cent. of the buildings stock in the EU is energy
inefficient; (ii) the changing and growing needs of the population: there is expected to be a 17.5 per cent.
population growth in Sweden, Norway and Finland between 2019 and 2070, and 70 per cent. of Swedish
workplaces as of 2021 are maintaining or enabling hybrid working environments; and (iii) the upgrade of
buildings with smart and sustainable solutions: more than 30 per cent. of public and non-residential buildings
with EPC ratings of “G” and below are expected to be upgraded by 2030 and there is an estimated €5 trillion
investment needed in energy renovation to meet the European Union’s Net Zero emissions target. In the
installation and services market, the key drivers are also expected to include: (i) cost inflation (estimated 2 to 3
per cent. CAGR contribution from 2023 to 2026), as pass-through mechanisms are generally included in
contracts driving overall nominal market growth; (ii) growth in building stock (estimated 0 to 1 per cent. CAGR
contribution from 2023 to 2026), as the growth in underlying building stock drives an increase in the number
of installations and therefore service requirements; (iii) service and installation intensity (estimated 0 to 1 per
cent. CAGR contribution from 2023 to 2026), as increased installation intensity and complexity drive the need
for more frequent and qualified service; and (iv) a slowdown in new build volume (estimated negative 1 per
cent. CAGR contribution from 2023 to 2026), as this slowdown is primarily driven by a decrease in residential
new builds, all according to an independent third-party consultant. We are strongly positioned to succeed in this
attractive and resilient growth market, leveraging our market leading position which has been significantly
strengthened following the Caverion Combination, as shown in the chart below, which presents our market
position and market share on a Combined Group basis in Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Germany and
Austria, compared to the market share of our top three competitors for the same periods.

In addition to leading positions at the country level, the Group has selectively targeted local regions within
countries where it holds strong market positions. This is reflected by the diagram below showing the percentage
of the Combined Group’s Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 in Sweden, Norway, and Finland
split by regions where we have (i) less than 5 per cent. market share for those respective regions, (ii) between
5 and 10 per cent. market share for those respective regions and (iii) more than 10 per cent. market share for
those respective regions.

(2) Based on 2022 revenue data, does not include technical facility management, high voltage and Caverion’s Industry
division in Finland.

Our increased group-wide scale and local strength provide differentiating competitive advantages. At the
segment level, we are able to utilize our procurement expertise to optimize sourcing supplier terms within each
segment and leverage our digital capabilities. We also have strong HR, financial and business development
functions complementing resources on a regional and local level. We can also leverage certain central functions
such as finance, legal, communication and our central IT platform. Finally, our capabilities across the Group
can be used to provide customers with comprehensive solutions that span a range of technical disciplines.

At the local level, our geographic network comprises approximately 369 units on a Combined Group basis, as
of March 31, 2024, in close proximity to customers in selectively targeted markets. In certain locations, our
segments share premises, which allows for significant cross-selling and cost-reduction opportunities. In addition
to being better positioned to win local tenders, our cross-staffing ability between units allows us to optimize
project selection. Further, our local scale has allowed us to build a workforce of approximately 21,500
employees (on a Combined Group basis) as of March 31, 2024, with many of our employees preferring to work
for a larger, but decentralized, company such as ourselves due to supportive and clear governance, stability,
brand awareness and personal development opportunities.

###### Highly complementary skills across the full life-cycle of customer needs, creating a virtuous cycle that drives cross-selling across advisory & engineering, projects & services

The Combined Group boasts a portfolio of complementary capabilities that cater to the full life-cycle of
customers’ needs, generating a virtuous cycle that optimizes cross-selling across the advisory engineering,
services and projects segments. Our client relations will be enhanced by offering ongoing services, which in

7


-----

turn can unlock lucrative projects assignments, and further advisory & engineering tasks that provide profound
insights into clients’ assets. This strategic integration augments our local service capabilities and allows early
engagement in our clients’ value chains, fostering deep relationships. It is supported by comprehensive, longterm contracts for onsite managed services and technical facility management, enhancing operational
excellence. Additionally, Assemblin has traditionally excelled in projects, while Caverion has demonstrated
strength in services, further emphasizing the complementary nature of the business of the Combined Group.

Moreover, our distinguishable services and advisory & engineering capabilities offer both route and site-based
models, which extend our conversion capabilities from services to advisory & engineering to projects, adding
incremental value to the relationship lifecycle with our clients. Our specialization in GreenTech solutions,
coupled with refined project bidding and management expertise across an array of project sizes and disciplines,
makes us well-positioned for effective projects executions. Our approach promotes recurring cash flow and
visibility from our order book, anchored by a cost+ approach to pricing.

###### Relentless focus on operational excellence with a proven playbook to drive profitability improvement

We believe that our decentralized business model, structured around technical disciplines and supported by
strong leadership teams, creates a distinct competitive advantage compared to other players in the market. The
division of our business into technical disciplines allows managers and their teams to focus on growing
operations within their areas of expertise. This structure also provides career development opportunities for
talented employees within their respective business lines and promotes sharing of experiences, competences,
and best practices. Furthermore, we believe that it is more attractive for acquired companies to be integrated
into a segment focused on the same technical discipline as themselves, and our structure facilitates the efficient
integration of acquired companies.

While we maintain a strong shared culture based on core values, guiding principles and fundamental ethical
standpoints set forth in our Code of Conduct, we promote an “entrepreneurial” culture within each segment.
Unit managers are expected to drive margin improvement and lead a specialized and skilled workforce.
Typically, unit managers are selected based on their personnel management skills and previous project
managing experience. Unit managers receive financial incentives in the form of bonuses based on Adjusted
EBITA margin and working capital levels, and these targets have a high level of uniformity across units in order
to motivate underperforming and averagely performing units towards the desired margin levels. The size of
these bonuses depends on the size of the unit, the manager’s monthly salary, and the portion of Adjusted EBITA
margin above a pre-determined threshold. Incentive payments for unit managers can equal up to six months of
the unit managers’ salaries. In addition, we operate a system with a focus on cash generation being emphasized,
by letting unit managers pay/receive interest on net working capital balances. Lastly, all unit managers are
offered the opportunity to invest in the management incentive programme and over 600 employees are expected
to be shareholders in the Group following completion of our management incentive programme, which aligns
interest across the organization and encourages the managers to support the long-term goal of the Group to
deliver consistent and low-risk growth in EBITA and cash.

The success of our business model is evidenced by our track record of margin improvement (even through the
integration of previous bolt-on acquisitions) and strong employee retention levels of 90 per cent. for the year
ended December 31, 2023 (compared to 88 per cent. and 87 per cent. for two of our top competitors and
according to their public reporting).

Whilst our decentralised model is a key enabler of our commercial success, with customers who seek close
proximity with their services provider, and with a structure that allows our unit managers to navigate local
market dynamics in a quick and agile manner, the Group has a comprehensive governance model in place to
ensure robust control over performance beyond aligning incentives with our employees as explained above.

8


-----

Our governance model includes systematic project selection criteria and process management measures, the
replacement of underperforming unit managers and projects, closure of non-performing units and a corporate
culture focused on profitability over volume. We also maintain structured follow-up and reporting procedures,
user-friendly business intelligence tools for performance monitoring and EBITA and net working capital-based
employee incentives on a unit level. To help us continuously monitor our profitability enhancement measures,
we track the following KPIs across our organization:

We also have a proven ability to implement operational efficiency measures, with an example of this being the
successful implementation of our Accelerated Profitability Programme in 2019, where we delivered
approximately SEK 70 million of savings through overhead savings such as reduction in overhead costs across
the organizational structure and approximately SEK 11 million through pruning of underperforming branches,
including eight underperforming units and some small offices, and other operational efficiency measures.

The result of our robust operational model is visible in the EBITA margin growth Assemblin has delivered over
the years and evident in our improving margins at the individual unit level. At Assemblin, we have reduced the
proportion of loss-making units in our network from approximately 27 per cent., as of 2017 to 13 per cent.
2023. At the same time, the proportion of units delivering over 8 per cent. Assemblin EBITA margin increased
from 16 per cent. to 35 per cent. over the same period. Significant improvement has also been seen at Caverion
with the proportion of loss-making units reducing from 24 per cent. in 2019 to 16 per cent. in 2023.

The diagram below shows the split of our units by profitability across various EBITDA levels for Assemblin
and Caverion.

**Evolution of Assemblin unit profitability**

**Evolution of Caverion unit profitability**

Despite this improvement, we believe we will continue to have opportunities to increase our margins through
our organizational structure and strong profitability focus. We plan to continue to incentivize our unit managers
to seek margin enhancement initiatives on a local unit level, to drive operational efficiency improvements and
further cost consciousness. We are able to implement our business model and focus on margin improvement
through our acquired businesses.

###### Unique positioning within the high growth and high margin GreenTech segment

We believe that we are well positioned to benefit from the expected growth in higher margin segments of the
installation and services market, such as smart buildings, GreenTech, and niche segments, mainly including fire
& security, sprinklers, cooling and refrigeration.

We believe that our position as a sizeable player within the BMS segment, with strong technical competence
and end-to-end integration solutions, combined with our proprietary product offering, provides a competitive
advantage. We can offer complete bespoke solutions to customers, from design to installation and subsequent
servicing of the systems.

10


-----

Furthermore, we have a strong GreenTech offering, which includes resource-efficient products and solutions to
improve energy efficiency and optimization, solar panel installations, Energy Performance Contract (EnPC)
solutions that help decarbonize building stocks, renewable heating solutions and electric vehicle charging
solutions and BMS solutions. We have enhanced our GreenTech offering through the acquisitions of Tom Allen
Senera, a Finnish provider of energy optimized systems for buildings including, among others, geothermal
solutions, and Electrotec Energy, an experienced solar panel installation provider with experience in solar cells
and energy storage. Through our BMS and GreenTech offering, we are strongly positioned to support our
customers’ smart building, digitalization and energy transition.

Not only are these segments supported by a highly attractive growth outlook (the BMS market is estimated to
grow at a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 8 per cent. between 2021 and 2026, according to
public sources) underpinned by a critical need to make buildings energy efficient, but these segments also
benefit from a highly attractive margin profile.

The strength of our presence in this segment is evidenced by our share of EU taxonomy aligned revenues
significantly exceeding peers, as shown below compared to our top two comparable peers.

Note:

(1) Revenues from activities that are aligned with a net zero trajectory by 2050 and the broader environmental goals
other than climate per EU taxonomy for sustainable activities classification system.

(2) Based on data for the year ended December 31, 2023 for the Combined Group, and publicly reported data for the
years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023 for Competitor #1 and Competitor #2, respectively.

###### Diversified and low-risk revenue with high visibility from a strong order backlog and recurring services

We operate a business that is diversified amongst different end-markets, regions, specific customers and contract
size. We operate a diversified mix of end-market segments with 57 per cent. of our Combined Group Net
revenue generated from the services segment, 11 per cent. of our Combined Group Net revenue generated from
the industrial segment, 10 per cent. of our Combined Group Net revenue generated from the social infra segment
(consisting of health centers, hospitals and educational buildings), 7 per cent. of our Combined Group Net
revenue generated from the residential segment, 6 per cent. of our Combined Group Net revenue generated
from the offices segment, 4 per cent. of our Combined Group Net revenue generated from the public infra
segment (consisting of infrastructure, traffic, storage and transit halls), 3 per cent. of our Combined Group Net
revenue generated from retail and Hotels, Restaurants and Cafes (“HoReCa”) segments and 2 per cent. of our
Combined Group Net revenue generated from culture and sports for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our
customer base is also diversified, as, according to our management’s estimates, our top ten customers, on a

11


-----

Combined Group basis, accounted for approximately 10 per cent. of our Combined Group Net revenue for the
year ended December 31, 2023.

Our geographical footprint across Europe also ensures that we are not significantly exposed to the macroeconomic events in any single country. In the year ended December 31, 2023, in terms of our Combined Group
revenue, 37 per cent. was generated from Sweden, 24 per cent. was generated from Finland, 15 per cent. was
generated from Norway, 12 per cent. was generated from Germany, 7 per cent. was generated from Austria, 4
per cent. was generated from Denmark and 1 per cent. was generated from the Baltics.

Furthermore, we have limited exposure to large contracts that would expose us to material risk from any one
project. Management estimates that projects (which include both installation projects as well as certain services
projects subject to percentage of completion accounting) over EUR 15 million, between EUR 5-15 million,
between EUR 1-5 million, between EUR 0.5-1 million and less than EUR 0.5 million represented 7 per cent.,
8 per cent., 14 per cent., 5 per cent. and 9 per cent. of our Combined Group Net revenue, respectively, with the
remainder being derived from services.

We also benefit from a high level of visibility in our business model. Our order backlog enhances near-term
visibility and has consistently stayed above 70 per cent. of revenues on an annual basis since the year ended
December 31, 2021. We take a consistent approach to order booking and only include signed contracts in our
order backlog. Our order backlog is also conservatively stated as we are able to pass through inflationary effects
to our customers rather than adjusting backlog upwards.

The share of services, as a portion of our Net revenues has remained strong and stable over the years. During
the year ended December 31, 2021, service represented 42 per cent. of our Net revenues at Assemblin, whilst
services represented 41 per cent. of Assemblin’s Net revenue for the Aggregated Total over the twelve months
ended March 31, 2024. The Caverion Combination has significantly increased the share of services to 57 per
cent., as a percentage of our Combined Group Net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023.

###### A cash generative and robust financial profile supported by cost base flexibility, inflation resilience, structurally low capital expenditures and working capital intensity

The Combined Group has displayed a strong track record of growth and profitability over the historical period.
The Combined Group has delivered a CAGR in Combined Group Net revenues of 7 per cent. between January
1, 2021 and March 31, 2024. This has been supported by impressive organic growth, averaging 4 per cent.
across the period for the Combined Group. A low-risk M&A strategy has supplemented the organic growth
profile historically.

Similarly, the Combined Group has delivered impressive EBITA expansion over the historical period with
consistent margin improvement. The Adjusted EBITA margin for the Combined Group has increased from 5.0
per cent. between the period ending December 31, 2021 to 5.8 per cent. over the last twelve months ended
March 31, 2024.

Our high cash flow generation has been driven by capital-light operations together with efficient working capital
management. Our operations require very limited capital expenditure and lease expenses, which primarily
comprises of tools, vehicles refurbishment and IT costs. On a Combined Group basis, our Combined Group Net
Tangible Non-lease Capital Expenditure as a percentage of Combined Group Net revenue was 0.2 per cent. in
the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, as well as for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024.
On a Combined Group basis, our net working capital as a percentage of Combined Group Net revenue was
negative 6.6 per cent., negative 5.1 per cent. and negative 5.5 per cent. in the years ended December 31, 2021,
2022 and 2023, respectively, and negative 5.6 per cent. for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024.

We have a high focus on working capital management across the Group. Our ability to generate free cash flow
has contributed to our growth and has allowed us to undertake a successful acquisition strategy. Our successful

12


-----

and proven business model, combined with well-established long-term customer relationships, should promote
our goals to continue to achieve profitable growth and deleverage going forward.

Even in an inflationary environment, our contract structures drive our ability to achieve our desired level of
profitability. According to management estimates in 2022 for Sweden and Norway, approximately 65 per cent.
of Assemblin’s contracts as of December 31, 2022 were structured with cost-plus pricing, an approach giving
us the ability to pass through input price inflation onto our customers. We are also able to mitigate inflationary
pressures on the remaining approximately 35 per cent., consisting of fixed price contracts that typically have a
short-term contract length and an optimized central procurement system, which allows us to manage the delay
of impact and apply indexing. For any long-term fixed price contracts, those are predominantly managed using
double index dynamics where we index to customers, and suppliers index to us, ensuring further protection
against inflationary pressures.

The diagram below shows our management’s estimate of Assemblin’s revenues by contract type during the year
ended December 31, 2023, assumed to be consistent with the estimates in 2022.

Note:

(1) Estimates are indicative and based on management’s review with local managers in Sweden and Norway of contracts
that were expected to be delivered in 2022. For Service – Cost + contracts, management believes it is able to reflect
the impact of inflation in its pricing of service assignments (including driven by the small and short term-nature of
some of the service assignments). In management’s opinion, small and short-term service assignments are cost plus
in nature as they allow for a high conviction view on the impact of inflation on expected costs, and pricing is set
accordingly to secure a desired level of profitability.

The resilience of our margin profile is enhanced by the fact that, on a Combined Group basis, 91 per cent. of
our costs as of December 31, 2023 are either variable or semi-variable. These costs are largely related to labor
and materials, with minimal overhead and fixed assets. Furthermore, our cost base is largely safeguarded against
inflation due to the short duration of projects and wage pass-through clauses incorporated into both services
and longer-duration project contracts.

###### Excellent management team set up to capture the best of both Assemblin and Caverion, supported by a highly experienced financial sponsor in the sector

Our decentralized network is managed by a highly experienced management team, consisting of professionals
with strong backgrounds and operational expertise within technical installation and services solutions, and a
proven track record of acquiring and integrating new businesses, with strong leaderships centered around
technical disciplines. Under the Assemblin Group AB leadership, we have had a successful track record of
margin expansion and have positioned us as a leading installation company in the Nordic region. Caverion’s
leadership has equally shown a successful track record of margin expansion, specifically after Jacob Götzsche’s

13


-----

appointment as President and CEO in 2021 and has positioned Caverion as a leading digital and services player
in the Nordics. We believe that the harmonisation of highly experienced management teams following the
Caverion Combination, at the Group as well as at the unit level, provides us with a key advantage in continuing
to seek growth and development of each segment and for the Group. There is strong cultural alignment across
the teams, with a relentless focus on operational excellence.

###### Our Strategy

 Capitalize on an enhanced offering of the Group to continue to deliver market leading installation and services solutions

The Group combines the strengths and capabilities of both Assemblin and Caverion, offering a broader range
of services and providing sustainable technical solutions to an expanded customer base. Following the Caverion
Combination, we have completed a transformational step in creating scale, further diversification, strengthened
market leadership and density and an enhanced services offering as part of the Group’s product mix. This will
provide a platform to capture a larger share of opportunities in the highly resilient markets in which we operate.
Further, the synergies that we are able to benefit from following the Caverion Combination will provide
operating efficiencies going forward and will allow us to execute our backlog more efficiently with the
possibility of further enhanced profit margins. Some of the steps we have already taken in order to deliver the
synergies from the Caverion Combination include prioritizing the integration of operations and focusing on
profitability improvements, implementing our proven organizational roadmap to ensure a smooth transition and
securing business continuity from day one. We have also reduced selling, general, and administrative expenses
by emphasizing a lean organizational structure and eliminating overlaps. Furthermore, we are consolidating and
managing our unit network with a focus on leveraging complementary strengths to boost overall performance
and actively pursuing quick wins in procurement processes.

Within the first 100 days following the Caverion Combination we expect to secure SEK 180 million in synergies
comprising SG&A savings through overhead reductions such as reductions in managerial and administrative
overlap, both on a Group and divisional level. We have already actioned 57% of these as of April 30, 2024, with
the remainder expected to be fully executed in the first half of 2024.

Furthermore, we are analyzing certain under-performing operations in Sweden, Norway and Finland, with a
view to improving or discontinuing them in 2024, which is fundamental to the Group’s future margin
improvement. Additional savings resulting from IT optimizations and efficiencies as well as procurement
improvements are also expected between 2024 and 2025. Overall, we expect that the total savings resulting
from the above efforts, including further SG&A reductions will be achieved within the first 24 months following
the Caverion Combination and will exceed twice the amount of our currently quantified overhead savings.

Further, we expect the commercial possibilities within cross-selling, leveraging complementary strengths and
utilizing the Group’s strengthened geographical density to both drive more sales and enable better solutions for
the existing customer base as well as using other units instead of external subcontractors to improve margins.

###### Continue to focus on profitable growth by lifting performance across the Group's unit network

We are determined to grow our business profitably and sustainably, fulfilling our potential by increasing market
share and winning new projects and services contracts without compromising on profitability.

We are well positioned to grow our market shares in Sweden, Norway and Finland by continuing to provide
high-quality services and by focusing on strengthening local operations. We intend to continue to operate a
large, decentralized organization, with local units operating as individual profit centers, and to uplift margins in
average and underperforming units. Due to our decentralized organization, unit performance, and the ability to
improve unit profitability margins, are highly dependent on attracting, retaining and motivating key employees,
including unit managers. We evaluate unit performance issues through a comprehensive set of key performance

14


-----

indicators, such as employee competence, contract execution, order intake, procurement performance, services
portfolio management, overhead management and invoicing/cash collection procedures, and we address
performance issues through a tailored action plan. Specifically, we aim to improve margins at average and
underperforming units through: (i) a strong focus on active performance management of local operations; (ii)
employee education and skill enhancement initiatives (including training and monitoring courses for technicians
to drive upselling and better leverage our brand); (iii) unit governance improvements including, among other
things, improved tendering procedures and an efficient internal scorecard process; (iv) the accelerated
deployment of digital tools, including financial transparency tools, both on a unit as well as on a project level;
(v) accelerated project-to-services revenue conversion (by means of enhanced indicator-tracking and follow-up
procedures); and (vi) expanding to new untapped customers (based on a systematic customer base analysis to
identify high potential accounts, leveraging unit best practices for new customer conversion and tracking
customer conversion at the Group level). Assemblin’s Adjusted EBITDA margin for the Aggregated LTM Total
of 9.3 per cent., however, was a significant improvement from Assemblin’s Adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.7
per cent. for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our Combined Group Adjusted EBITDA margin for the twelve
months ended March 31, 2024 was 8.2 per cent. Our approach to continuing our stable and profitable growth
can be summarized below.

We have a strong record of historic margin improvements across our business, in part due to our efforts to
improve profitability and cut costs across the Group and maximizing margins remains one of our long term
growth strategies.

###### Grow the services business across the Group

We have transitioned from a mainly project-focused organization to establishing separate local services
organizations with dedicated services managers, increased the hiring of services technicians and also established
separate tracking measures and employee and manager margin-linked incentives.

The Caverion Combination has moved our product mix into an enhanced percentage of revenues related to
services, and we expect that growth in our services revenues will increase our bottom line, as our services
assignments tend to have higher margins than our contractor assignments. On a Combined Group basis, our
Combined Group services revenue accounted for 57 per cent. of our Combined Group Net revenue for the
twelve months ended March 31, 2024.

We aim to drive further growth in the services business by: (i) applying best practices developed by services
champions across our entire unit network; (ii) identifying, attracting, training, retaining and motivating a
sufficient number of highly skilled technical employees, which we consider to be a key factor to grow the
relatively personnel-dependent services business across the Group; (iii) strengthening the coordination of our
sales teams to increase project-to-services sales conversion; (iv) consolidating the services segments from

15


-----

Caverion and (v) enhancing key account management activities to increase the number of larger services
customers assignments.

###### Continue our proven and margin accretive acquisition strategy

We continuously evaluate new opportunities to acquire installation and technical services providers in Northern
Europe in order to strengthen our local competitive position, complement our offering and consolidate our
presence in attractive market segments. We have proven experience in identifying, executing and integrating
other companies, while remaining committed to our existing business model and values and while in 2024 the
pace of our acquisition activities might slow as a result of our integration efforts related to the Caverion
Combination, selective acquisitions remain a part of our medium term strategy. To complement our business
strategy, we focus on targets with high margins, typically paying a multiple of approximately 4-6 times the
target’s EBITA, with an average target EBITA margin of above Assemblin’s existing margin levels. In order to
grow through margin accretive acquisitions, we need to maintain operating agility and a strong ability to react
to changing market dynamics, including a potential increase in competition for the acquisition of attractive
targets (which could result in higher purchase price multiples). We have differentiated acquisition capabilities
which cover the full cycle of an acquisition process from the screening phase (by means of decentralized deal
sourcing by segment), to execution (through a Group acquisition team providing execution bandwidth) and
including post-closing integration (by means of tailored toolboxes and governance solutions). Whilst
management is looking forward to delivering the strong value creation potential possible through the
combination of Assemblin and Caverion, going forward we will focus on selectively acquiring small sized
targets in line with what has been done historically.

###### Accelerate growth in new expanding segments, building on strategic investments

Over a number of years, we have strengthened our position by complementing our traditional focus on technical
disciplines such as electrical, heating & sanitation, and ventilation, with growth in the smart buildings market
segment, GreenTech solutions, and other niche segments such as cooling and refrigeration (which typically
have higher growth and margins than the overall installation market). We expect to further expand our share in
these markets by combining our expertise with the capabilities of the companies acquired in recent years such
as Fidelix, Tom Allen Senera and Electrotec Energy. Electrotec Energy and Tom Allen Senera have strengthened
our offering of sustainable installation solutions, particularly in the areas of installation of solar panels and
energy storage (through the installation, maintenance and servicing of panels and energy storages) and heat
pumps (through a diversified product range including ground space, air to water and exhaust air implementing
installation with storage solutions), while the acquisition of Fidelix has enhanced our position in the BMS
market segment.

###### The Transactions

We collectively refer to the Caverion Combination, the Offering and the Financing as the “Transactions.”

###### The Caverion Combination

Crayfish BidCo Oy (“Crayfish BidCo”), a Finnish company controlled by Triton Fund V, announced on
January 10, 2023 an initial public cash tender offer for all the shares in Caverion (the “Triton Offer”) at a price
of EUR 8.00 per share. On February 24, 2023, Crayfish BidCo amended its previous offer price to EUR 8.95
per share (the “Amended Offer Price”) (later adjusted to EUR 8.75 (the “Adjusted Offer Price”) following
the payment of a dividend of EUR 0.20 per share, which settled prior to the consummation of the Triton Offer).
The Amended Offer Price of EUR 8.95 per share valued Caverion’s total equity at approximately EUR 1.2bn
(disregarding the 1,873,825 shares held in treasury by Caverion). On November 6, 2023, Crayfish BidCo
announced final results of the Triton Offer, where the shares validly tendered at the Adjusted Offer Price of
EUR 8.75 represented approximately 94.39 per cent. in aggregate of all the issued and outstanding shares and
votes in Caverion. On November 28, 2023, Crayfish BidCo announced that it will commence redemption

-----

proceedings in respect of the remaining minority shares (5.61%) in Caverion (the “Caverion Squeeze Out”).
The enterprise value for the purchase at the Amended Offer Price of EUR 8.95 per share was around EUR 1.5
billion at announcement, representing an enterprise value to Adjusted EBITDA multiple of 9.0x and an
enterprise value to Adjusted EBITA multiple of 13.8x (based on Caverion’s Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITA for the year ended December 31, 2022 of EUR 163.0m and EUR 105.8m, respectively).

On April 1, 2024, we announced the completion of a transaction pursuant to which our shareholder, Triton,
transferred 100% of the share capital held by it in Crayfish Holdco Oy (“Crayfish Holdco”), the indirect parent
of the Caverion Group, to the Issuer in a combination to create a leading northern European technical and
service installation company (the “Caverion Combination”). The aggregate equity consideration of EUR 918
million for Crayfish HoldCo was funded by (i) an unconditional shareholder contribution in an amount of EUR
418 million (the “Shareholder Contribution”) and (ii) a subordinated shareholder loan in the amount of SEK
5,726.5 (EUR 500 million equivalent) (the “Shareholder Bridge Loan”). The aggregate equity consideration
of EUR 918 million for Crayfish HoldCo is based on the approximately EUR 1.2 billion implied total equity
value of Caverion at the Adjusted Offer Price of EUR 8.75 per share, (i) less the value of the remaining minority
shareholders in Caverion, (ii) less gross bank debt incurred by Crayfish BidCo for the purpose of acquiring the
shares in Caverion and paying transaction costs as of March 31, 2024 and (iii) plus Triton’s transaction costs in
the tender offer. A portion of the Shareholder Bridge Loan will be repaid by the Issuer on the Issue Date, with
the unpaid portion being converted into equity in the Issuer.

###### The Financing

The proceeds of the offering of the Notes (the “Offering”) will be used to (i) repay the Existing Caverion Senior
Facilities plus any accrued and unpaid interest (on or about the Issue Date), (ii) repay a portion of the
Shareholder Bridge Loan the unpaid portion of which will be converted into equity in the Issuer) (on or about
the Issue Date), (iii) fund the Caverion Squeeze Out and (iv) any related fees, costs, taxes and expenses relating
to the Transactions.

In connection with the Caverion Combination, the lenders under the Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities
Agreement have agreed to upsize the commitments under the Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities
Agreement pursuant to an additional facility notice whereby the commitments will be increased with an
additional aggregate commitments of SEK 370 million and EUR 125 million under the revolving facility and
EUR 150 million under the guarantee facility, and to certain other amendments (the “RCF Upsize”). See
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—The Super Senior Facilities.” The foregoing financing
arrangements, together with the application of proceeds thereof as set out under “Use of Proceeds,” are referred
to herein as the “Financing.”

###### Recent Developments

 Bolt-on Acquisitions

Since April 1, 2024, excluding the Caverion Combination, no acquisitions have been completed.

###### Trading Update

Based on preliminary results from our unaudited management accounts for April 2024, and other information
currently available, we estimate our net revenue as well as Adjusted EBITDA (including margin) remain on the
same trajectory as the quarter ending March 31, 2024. The year-to-date performance on these metrics continues
to exceed the relevant period in the prior year.

The above information relating to our current performance is derived from our internal management accounts.
Our management accounts are produced by financial reporting systems that we use as the basis of preparation
for our annual results at the end of each fiscal year. This information has been prepared by management. It has
neither been audited, reviewed, verified or subject to any procedures by our auditors nor been approved by our

Board of Directors, and you should not place undue reliance on it. This information should not be considered
indicative of our future results. This preliminary indication is based on management’s initial review of our
results of operations and is subject to change. See “Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” “Risk
_Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—_
_Assemblin” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—_
_Caverion” for a discussion of certain of the factors that could affect our future performance and results of_
operation.

obligations of the Issuer under the Existing Notes and the Super Senior Facilities Agreements and will rank senior
to all of the Issuer’s future indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes.

The obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Notes will be guaranteed, jointly and severally on a senior basis, by
each subsidiary of the Issuer that is a guarantor under the Existing Notes and the Super Senior Facilities. The Notes
will be secured by a first-priority security interest in the same assets that secure the Issuer’s and Guarantors’
obligations under the Existing Notes and the Super Senior Facilities, subject to certain agreed security principles
and agreed exceptions. See footnote (8) below and “The Offering—Guarantees” and “The Offering—Security.”

(4) On June 13, 2023, the Issuer entered into the Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities Agreement, which provides
for an initial SEK 1,100 million Revolving Credit Facility which will be increased by SEK 370 million and EUR
125 million on the Issue Date and a SEK 300 million Guarantee Facility, which will be increased by EUR 150
million on the Issue Date.

The Issuer is the initial borrower of the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility will be guaranteed
on a senior basis by the same guarantors and will be secured on a first-priority basis over the same Collateral securing
the Notes and the Existing Notes and certain hedging obligations. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—The Super Senior Facilities.”_

(5) The Revolving Credit Facility is part of the Super Senior Facilities which also include the Guarantee Facility and a
SEK 410 million Pension Guarantee Facility. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—The Super
_Senior Facilities—Overview and structure.” The Holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from enforcement of_
the Collateral and certain distressed disposals only after any obligations under all obligations under the Super Senior
Facilities, including obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Guarantee Facility and the Pension
Guarantee Facility, as well as certain hedging obligations (if any), have been repaid in full. See “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—The Super Senior Facilities.”_

(6) We expect to use the gross proceeds of the Offering along with cash from balance sheet to (i) repay the Existing
Caverion Senior Facilities plus any accrued and unpaid interest (on or about the Issue Date), (ii) repay a portion of
the Shareholder Bridge Loan the unpaid portion of which will be converted into equity in the Issuer) (on or about
the Issue Date), (iii) fund the Caverion Squeeze Out and (iv) any related fees, costs, taxes and expenses relating to
the Transactions. See “Use of Proceeds.”

(7) On July 3, 2023, the Issuer issued €480 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes
due 2029.

(8) Within 90 days following the Issue Date, the obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Notes will, subject to the
agreed security principles, be guaranteed, jointly and severally on a senior basis, by Assemblin Financing AB
(formerly Assemblin Group AB), Assemblin Holding AB, Assemblin AB, Assemblin Sweden AB, Assemblin
Norge AS, Fidelix Holding Oy, Assemblin AS, Assemblin VS AB, Assemblin El AB, Assemblin Ventilation AB,
Fidelix Oy, Assemblin Oy, Crayfish BidCo Oy and Crayfish HoldCo Oy. Within the later of (a) 90 days following
the Issue Date and (b) 30 days following Crayfish BidCo Oy obtaining title to all the issued and outstanding shares
in Caverion by posting security referred to in Chapter 18, Section 6 of the Finnish Companies Act, the Notes will
be guaranteed, jointly and severally on a senior basis, by Caverion Industria Oy, Caverion Suomi Oy, Caverion
Sverige AB, Caverion Norge AS and Caverion. As of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, the
Guarantors represented 77.5 per cent. of our Combined Group EBITDA and over 100 per cent. of our Combined
Group Assets (other than goodwill and shares in subsidiaries), in each case, calculated on a stand-alone basis without
giving effect to intra-group eliminations (including intra-group receivables).

(9) After the Issue Date, there may be a merger, acquisition or other combination between all, or any assortment of,
Apollo Swedish Holdco AB, the Issuer, Assemblin Financing AB, Assemblin Holding AB, Assemblin AB, Crayfish

Assemblin AB, Assemblin Sweden AB, Assemblin Norge AS,
Fidelix Holding Oy, Assemblin AS, Assemblin VS AB,
Assemblin El AB, Assemblin Ventilation AB, Fidelix Oy,

(the “Initial Post-Closing Date Guarantors”). Within the

22


-----

and, together with the Initial Post-Closing Date Guarantors, the
“Guarantors”). Each of the Guarantors will also be a
guarantor under the Existing Notes, Super Senior Facilities
(which includes the Pension Guarantee Facility and the
Guarantee Facility). The validity and enforceability of the
Notes Guarantees will be subject to significant limitations as
described in “Certain Insolvency Considerations and
_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes_
_Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

As of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, the
Guarantors represented 77.5 per cent. of our Combined Group
EBITDA and over 100 per cent. of our Combined Group Assets
(other than goodwill and shares in subsidiaries), in each case,
calculated on a stand-alone basis without giving effect to intragroup eliminations (including intra-group receivables). On an
as adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions as of
March 31, 2024, the subsidiaries of the Issuer that will not
guarantee the Notes would have had SEK 769 million
outstanding external financial indebtedness (of which SEK 754
million was attributable to leases).

Existing Notes, Super Senior Facilities (which includes
the Pension Guarantee Facility and the Guarantee
Facility) and certain hedging obligations; however,
holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from the
enforcement of the Collateral and certain distressed
disposals only after any obligations secured on a superpriority basis, including obligations under the Super
Senior Facilities and certain hedging obligations, have
been repaid in full;

Guarantor’s existing and future senior indebtedness that

23


-----

######  be effectively senior to any existing and future
indebtedness of each Guarantor that is not secured by the
Collateral owned by such Guarantor, to the extent of the
value of such Collateral; and

######  be effectively subordinated to any existing and future
indebtedness of each Guarantor that is secured by
property or assets that do not secure the Notes Guarantees
on an equal basis, to the extent of the value of the property
or assets securing such indebtedness.

The Notes Guarantees will be subject to release under certain
circumstances. See “Description of the Notes—Guarantees.”

subject to certain agreed security principles and agreed
exceptions:

with any receivables financing (including discounting or

24


-----

factoring or similar), any guarantee or letter of credit
financing, or similar) (if any, and only to the extent that

of which an Initial Post-Closing Guarantor is a creditor),

**Intercreditor Agreement** Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the first-priority
security interests securing the Notes will be contractually
deemed to rank equally with the security interests that secure
(but only to the extent that such security is expressed to secure
those liabilities) (i) obligations under the Existing Notes, (ii)
obligations under the Super Senior Facilities (which includes
the Pension Guarantee Facility and the Guarantee Facility), (iii)
certain obligations under hedging arrangements and (iv) certain
other future indebtedness and obligations permitted to be
incurred under the Indenture. Such security interests are, or will
be, evidenced by security documents for the benefit of
(whether directly or through the Security Agent) the holders of
the Notes, the Existing Notes, the lenders under the Super
Senior Facilities and/or the holders of certain other future
indebtedness or obligations permitted to be incurred under the
Indenture. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement,
subject to certain conditions, in the event of acceleration of the
Existing Notes, the Super Senior Facilities or the Notes,
amounts recovered in respect of the Notes, including from the
enforcement of the Collateral, will be required to repay
indebtedness in respect of the Super Senior Facilities, certain
future indebtedness and obligations permitted under the terms
of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement to rank pari
_passu_ with the Super Senior Facilities and future hedging
obligations (if any) in priority to the Notes, following the
payment of fees and expenses of the agent under the Super
Senior Facilities, the Existing Notes Trustee, the Trustee and
the Security Agent (and any receiver or delegate) and any fees
and expenses of any other creditor representative of future
indebtedness permitted under the terms of the Indenture to
benefit from such security interests.

The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the relevant
security unless instructed by the relevant Instructing Group (as
defined in the Intercreditor Agreement). The relevant
Instructing Group or such other class of creditors as specified
by the Intercreditor Agreement may, under certain conditions,
be entitled to instruct the Security Agent to enforce the relevant
security subject to, and in accordance with, the provisions of
the Intercreditor Agreement. In the event of conflicting
instructions, the Intercreditor Agreement contains provisions
as to which set of instructions will prevail. See “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

**Additional Amounts** Any payments made by the Issuer or any Guarantor with
respect to the Notes or the Notes Guarantees will be made
without withholding or deduction for or on account of taxes
unless required by law. If the Issuer or the Guarantors are
required by law to withhold or deduct amounts for or on

26


-----

account of tax imposed by a relevant taxing jurisdiction with
respect to a payment to the holders of Notes, the Issuer or the
relevant Guarantor will, subject to certain exceptions, pay the
additional amounts necessary so that the net amount received
by the holders of the Notes after the withholding or deduction
is not less than the amount that they would have received in the
absence of the withholding or deduction. See “Description of
_the Notes— Withholding Taxes.”_

**Use of Proceeds** We expect to use the proceeds of the Offering to (i) repay the
Existing Caverion Senior Facilities plus any accrued and
unpaid interest (on or about the Issue Date), (ii) repay a portion
of the Shareholder Bridge Loan, the unpaid portion of which
will be converted into equity in the Issuer (on or about the Issue
Date), (iii) fund the Caverion Squeeze Out and (iv) any related
fees, costs, taxes and expenses relating to the Transactions. See
“Use of Proceeds.”

at a redemption price of 100 per cent. of the principal amount,
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and additional
amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. See
“Description of the Notes—Redemption for Taxation Reasons.”

**Change of Control** Upon the occurrence of certain events defined as constituting a
change of control, the Issuer may be required to offer to
repurchase all outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash
equal to 101 per cent. of the principal amount thereof plus
accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. A change
of control will not be deemed to have occurred if a certain
consolidated net leverage ratio is not exceeded as a result of
such event, see “Description of the Notes—Change of Control”
and “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions—Specified
_Change of Control Event.”_

transferability and resale. See “Transfer Restrictions.” We have
not agreed to, or otherwise undertaken to, register the Notes
(including by way of an exchange offer) with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.

no established trading market. Although the Initial Purchasers

###### SUMMARY CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION

Prior to May 3, 2023, the Group’s historical financial information was consolidated at the level of Assemblin
Financing AB. On May 3, 2023, the newly formed Assemblin Group AB (publ) (formerly known as Apollo
Swedish Bidco AB (publ)) acquired Assemblin Financing AB (the “Assemblin Financing Acquisition”) and
became the reporting entity for the Group for accounting purposes. The acquisition was a part of a larger transfer
of holdings from Triton IV to Triton IV Continuation Fund. In connection with the change of ownership,
Assemblin Group AB (publ) was deemed to be the acquiror from an accounting perspective, resulting in a new
group being formed for accounting purposes. Following the Caverion Combination (as defined in “Summary—
_The Transactions—Caverion Combination), on April 1, 2024 Assemblin Group AB (publ) was renamed_
Assemblin Caverion Group AB (publ) (the “Issuer”). Due to these perimeter changes and the change of control,
the historical financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum for the periods prior to May 3, 2023
is for the Assemblin Financing Group (as defined below) and cannot be considered comparable to financial
information presented for the periods between May 3, 2023 and April 1, 2024 for the Assemblin Group (as
defined below).

Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, as used in this offering memorandum, the
“Group,” “Assemblin,” “our,” “we” or “us,” means, (i) on or prior to May 2, 2023, in the context of the
historical financial information and other operational data, the group of entities comprising Assemblin
Financing AB and its consolidated subsidiaries, (ii) on or after May 3, 2023 and up to April 1, 2024, in the
context of the historical financial information and other operational data, the group of entities comprising the
Issuer (formerly known as Assemblin Group AB (publ)) and its consolidated subsidiaries (for the avoidance of
doubt, excluding the Caverion Group) and (iii) on or after April 1, 2024, the Issuer and its subsidiaries, including
the Caverion Group. These periods are not directly comparable as they represent levels of consolidation under
different entities that were not under common control across the periods. References to the “Assemblin
**Financing Group” are to Assemblin Financing AB and its consolidated subsidiaries and references to the**
“Assemblin Group” are to the Issuer (formerly known as Assemblin Group AB (publ)) and its consolidated
subsidiaries prior to April 1, 2024 (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding the Caverion Group). References to
the “Combined Group” are to Assemblin prior to April 1, 2024 together with the Caverion Group, as if the
Caverion Combination had already taken place.

###### Assemblin Financial Information

This offering memorandum includes:

  - the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of Assemblin Caverion Group AB
(publ) as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2024 (the “Assemblin Group Unaudited
**Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements”);**

  - the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of Assemblin Financing AB as of
and for the three months ended March 31, 2023 (the “Assemblin Financing Group Unaudited
**Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements”);**

  - the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial information of Assemblin Financing AB as of
and for the four-month period from January 1, 2023 to May 2, 2023 (the “Assemblin Financing
**Group Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Four-Month Financial Information”);**

  - the audited consolidated financial statements of Assemblin Caverion Group AB (publ) as of and for
the eight-month period from May 3, 2023 to December 31, 2023 (the “Assemblin Group Audited
**Consolidated Eight-Month Financial Statements”); and**

31


-----

  - the audited consolidated financial statements of the Assemblin Financing AB for the years ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021 (the “Assemblin Financing Group Audited Consolidated Financial
**Statements”).**

The historical consolidated financial information for the Assemblin Financing Group and the Assemblin Group
has been prepared in accordance with the IFRS Accounting Standards as adopted by the EU. The unaudited
condensed consolidated interim financial information for Assemblin Financing Group for the period 1 January
to 2 May 2023 has been prepared based on IAS 34 “Interim financial reporting,” but is not fully in compliance
with IAS 34 due to the fact that no comparative periods are presented. The historical consolidated financial
information for the Assemblin Financing Group and the Assemblin Group appear in the F-pages of this offering
memorandum and should be read in conjunction with the relevant reports of our independent auditor.

In addition, this offering memorandum includes certain non-IFRS financial information on an aggregated basis,
which is derived by adding together the relevant line item from the Assemblin Financing Group Unaudited
Condensed Consolidated Four-Month Financial Information with the corresponding line item from the
Assemblin Group Audited Consolidated Eight-Month Financial Statements (the “2023 Aggregated Total
**Financial Information”). The period covering the 2023 Aggregated Total Financial Information is the “2023**
**Aggregated Total.” The 2023 Aggregated Total Financial Information has not been prepared pursuant to IFRS**
since it is an aggregation of consolidated financial information from two different groups (the Assemblin
Financing Group and the Assemblin Group, which were not under common control during the periods
aggregated) and, consequently, the aggregated amounts may not represent, and are not intended to represent,
the results that would have been achieved if the companies were under common control during relevant periods.
The 2023 Aggregated Total Financial Information has not been audited or reviewed by our independent auditors
or any third party. The 2023 Aggregated Total Financial Information is presented for informational purposes
only. It does not represent a full annual period, or the results that would have been achieved if the entities were
under common control during the period of time, and is presented solely to assist prospective investors in
assessing the comparability of the results of operations for the financial year ended December 31, 2023, by
presenting such position as the 2023 Aggregated Total, with the periods prior to the change in scope of
consolidation.

###### Caverion Financial Information

This offering memorandum includes:

   - the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of Caverion and its consolidated
subsidiaries (the “Caverion Group”) as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023
(the “Caverion Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements”); and

   - the audited consolidated financial statements of the Caverion Group for years ended December 31,
2023, 2022 and 2021 (the “Caverion Audited Consolidated Financial Statements” and, together
with the Caverion Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements, the “Caverion
**Financial Statements”).**

The Caverion Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU.

###### Aggregated LTM Total or LTM Data

Historical financial information, unaudited income statement information and other financial information is
provided in this offering memorandum for Assemblin for the period derived by subtracting, from the 2023
Aggregated Total Financial Information, the parallel financial information of the Assemblin Financing Group
Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements and adding the financial information of the
Assemblin Group Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements (the “Aggregated LTM
**Total”).**

32


-----

In addition, historical financial information, unaudited income statement information and other financial
information is provided in this offering memorandum for the last twelve months ended March 31, 2024 (“the
**twelve months ended March 31, 2024” or “LTM”), which have been calculated by subtracting from the**
financial information for the year ended December 31, 2023 the equivalent financial information for the three
months ended March 31, 2023 and adding the equivalent financial information for the three months ended
March 31, 2024.

The information for the Aggregated LTM Total and the LTM period has not been prepared pursuant to IFRS
since it is an aggregation of consolidated financial information from different groups (the Assemblin Financing
Group, the Assemblin Group and/or the Caverion Group, as the case may be, which were not under common
control during the periods aggregated) and, consequently, the aggregated amounts may not represent, and are
not intended to represent, the results that would have been achieved if the companies were under common
control during relevant periods. The information for the Aggregated LTM Total and the LTM has not been
audited or reviewed by our independent auditors or any third party and has been prepared for illustrative
purposes only and are not necessarily representative of the results of operations for any future period or the
financial condition at any future date. This data has been prepared solely for the purpose of this offering
memorandum and is not prepared in the ordinary course of Assemblin’s or Caverion’s financial reporting.

None of the as adjusted and pro forma consolidated financial information and underlying assumptions has been
audited, reviewed or verified by an independent accounting firm or other third party, nor has it been prepared
in accordance with U.S. GAAP SEC Regulation S-X or any other generally accepted accounting principles. The
actual results may differ significantly from those reflected in the as adjusted and _pro forma_ consolidated
financial information for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, differences in assumptions used to
prepare the as adjusted and pro forma consolidated financial information.

The Group’s consolidated financial information and other data should be read in conjunction with the
information contained in “Use of Proceeds,” “Capitalization,” “Summary Consolidated Financial and Other
_Information,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—_
_Assemblin,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—_
_Caverion” and the Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum._

(4) The information in the 2023 Aggregated Total and the Aggregated LTM Total columns has not been prepared pursuant to IFRS as the figures therein are
aggregations of consolidated financial information from two different groups (the Assemblin Financing Group and the Assemblin Group, which were not under
common control during the periods aggregated) and, consequently, the aggregated amounts may not represent, and are not intended to represent, the results
that would have been achieved if the companies were under common control during relevant periods. In this table, for each line item we reconcile the relevant
IFRS measure for the Assemblin Financing Group and the Assemblin Group to the 2023 Aggregated Total and the Aggregated LTM Total columns, as
applicable. This information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only, is not necessarily representative of the results of operations, cash flows or financial
position for any future period at any future date, and is not prepared in the ordinary course of Assemblin’s financial reporting.

(5) Figures are from the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Assemblin Financing Group as of and for the three months ended

(6) Figures are from the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Assemblin Group as of and for the three months ended March 31,

(7) For the 2023 Aggregated Total, the relevant figures are not the aggregate of the information from the four-month period ended May 2, 2023, for the Assemblin
Financing Group and the eight-month period ended December 31, 2023, for the Assemblin Group. A cash and cash equivalents balance of SEK 407 million
existed at May 2, 2023, and there were effects of exchange rate fluctuations totaling SEK 4 million, which would not be factored into a simple aggregate.
Consequently, adjustments of SEK 411 million have been made for the initial balance and the effects of exchange rate fluctuations for accuracy, and these are
reflected in the 2023 Aggregated Total and the Aggregated LTM Total.

(4) The information in the 2023 Aggregated Total and the Aggregated LTM Total columns has not been prepared pursuant to IFRS as the figures therein
are aggregations of consolidated financial information from two different groups (the Assemblin Financing Group and the Assemblin Group, which were
not under common control during the periods aggregated) and, consequently, the aggregated amounts may not represent, and are not intended to represent,
the results that would have been achieved if the companies were under common control during relevant periods. In this table, for each line item we
reconcile the relevant IFRS measure for the Assemblin Financing Group and the Assemblin Group to the 2023 Aggregated Total and the Aggregated
LTM Total columns, as applicable. This information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only, is not necessarily representative of the results of
operations, cash flows or financial position for any future period at any future date, and is not prepared in the ordinary course of Assemblin’s financial
reporting.

(7) Assemblin EBITA, Assemblin Adjusted EBITA, Assemblin Adjusted EBITDA and other ratios derived therefrom are non-IFRS measures. We define
Assemblin EBITA as Assemblin’s profit/loss for the year/period before income taxes, net financial items and amortization of intangible assets. We define
Assemblin Adjusted EBITA as Assemblin EBITA before items affecting comparability, which are categorized as acquisition, integration and start-up
costs, restructuring costs, transformation costs and other items affecting comparability, as described under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Assemblin—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Items Affecting Comparability of_

_Results of Operations.” We define Assemblin Adjusted EBITDA as Assemblin Adjusted EBITA before depreciation of property, plant and equipment._
Investors should not consider Assemblin EBITA, Assemblin Adjusted EBITA or Assemblin Adjusted EBITDA (a) as an alternative to operating
profit/loss as a measure of our operating performance, (b) as an alternative to cashflow from operating and investment activities as a measure of our
ability to meet cash needs or (c) as an alternative to any other measure of performance under IFRS. Assemblin EBITA, Assemblin Adjusted EBITA and
Assemblin Adjusted EBITDA as presented in this offering memorandum may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies
due to differences in the way these measures are calculated. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Presentation of Financial and Other
_Data—Non-IFRS Measures.” Investors should also note that Assemblin EBITA, Assemblin Adjusted EBITA and Assemblin Adjusted EBITDA, as_
presented above are calculated differently from “Consolidated EBITDA” as defined and used in the Indenture. See “Description of Notes—Certain
_Definitions” for a definition of “Consolidated EBITDA” in the Indenture. The following is a reconciliation of profit/loss to Assemblin EBITA, Assemblin_
Adjusted EBITA and Assemblin Adjusted EBITDA.

Notes:

(1) Caverion EBITA, Caverion Adjusted EBITA, Caverion Adjusted EBITDA and other ratios derived therefrom are non-IFRS measures. We define
Caverion EBITA as Caverion’s results for the period before income taxes, financial income and expenses and amortization and impairment. We define
Caverion Adjusted EBITA as Caverion EBITA before items affecting comparability, which are categorized as capital gains and/or losses and transaction
costs related to divestments and acquisitions, write downs, expenses and/or income from separately identified major risk projects, restructuring expenses

and other items affecting comparability, as described under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—

_Caverion—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Items Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations.” We define Caverion Adjusted_
EBITDA as Caverion Adjusted EBITA before depreciation of property, plant and equipment. Caverion Adjusted EBITDA is affected by the same
adjustments as Caverion Adjusted EBITA, except for restructuring costs, which do not include depreciation and impairment relating to restructurings.
Investors should not consider Caverion EBITA, Caverion Adjusted EBITA or Caverion Adjusted EBITDA (a) as an alternative to operating profit/loss
as a measure of Caverion’s operating performance, (b) as an alternative to cashflow from operating and investment activities as a measure of Caverion’s
ability to meet cash needs or (c) as an alternative to any other measure of performance under IFRS. Caverion EBITA, Caverion Adjusted EBITA and
Caverion Adjusted EBITDA as presented in this offering memorandum may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies
due to differences in the way these measures are calculated. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Presentation of Financial and Other
_Data—Non-IFRS Measures.”_

###### Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information

In this offering memorandum, we include unaudited pro forma financial information for (i) the three months
ended March 31, 2024 and (ii) the year ended December 31, 2023, together with related explanatory notes
(collectively, the “Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information”), and (iii) the three months ended March
31, 2023 and (iv) the last twelve months ended March 31, 2024 (collectively, the “Unaudited Pro Forma
**Financial Other Information”). See “Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information” and “Unaudited Pro**
_Forma Financial Other Information.”_

The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information and the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Other Information has
been prepared to illustrate the hypothetical effects that the Assemblin Financing Acquisition and Caverion
Combination might have had on the Issuer’s:

i. unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of financial position as of March 31, 2024 as
if the Caverion Combination occurred on March 31, 2024;

ii. unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of profit or loss for the three-months ended
March 31, 2023, the unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of profit or loss for the financial year
ended December 31, 2023, unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of profit or loss for
the three-months ended March 31, 2024 and the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated
statement of profit or loss for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 as if the Assemblin Financing
Acquisition and the Caverion Combination occurred on January 1, 2023.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information and the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Other Information
included herein is not necessarily indicative of what the unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of financial
position or the unaudited pro forma consolidated or unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of
profit or loss of the Issuer would have been if the Assemblin Financing Acquisition and the Caverion
Combination had been completed as of the dates indicated, nor do they purport to project the future consolidated
financial position or consolidated profit of the Issuer. The actual consolidated financial position and
consolidated profit may differ significantly from the pro forma amounts reflected herein due to a variety of
factors. The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information and the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Other
Information is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect the costs of any integration activities
or cost savings or synergies that may be achieved as a result of the Assemblin Financing Acquisition and the
Caverion Combination (although our Pro Forma Adjusted Run-Rate EBITDA included in the Pro Forma
Adjusted and as adjusted Non-IFRS Information (as defined below) does reflect our estimates of such synergies
and cost savings).

The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information and the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Other Information
reflects transaction accounting adjustments management believes are necessary to demonstrate the potential
effects that the Assemblin Financing Acquisition and the Caverion Combination might have had on the
unaudited pro forma consolidated or unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of profit or loss
and unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of financial position of the Issuer following these
acquisitions as of and for the period indicated. The transaction-related adjustments are based on currently
available information and assumptions that management believes are, under the circumstances and given the
information available at this time, reasonable, and reflective of adjustments necessary to report the consolidated
statement of financial position and consolidated statement of profit and loss as if the Assemblin Financing
Acquisition and the Caverion Combination were completed on assumed dates.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information and the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Other Information has
been prepared to illustrate the hypothetical effects of the Assemblin Financing Acquisition and the Caverion
Combination and does not necessarily reflect other impacts like potential variations related to purchase price

allocation (“PPA”) following these acquisitions. Certain PPA adjustments or application of associated
accounting rules could result in different carrying values for existing assets and can influence amortization and
depreciation expenses and may lead to considerable variances in our future consolidated financial statements.

A PPA of the Caverion Combination has been prepared applying IFRS 3 “Business Combination.” In the
preliminary PPA, the allocation of identifiable assets and liabilities is measured at fair value. The difference
between the consideration and the Caverion Group’s identifiable assets and liabilities including acquisitionrelated intangible assets is recognised as goodwill in the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement
of financial position. Goodwill is not subject to amortization but will be tested yearly for impairment or when
there is an indication of impairment. Acquisition-related intangible assets have been identified in the
preliminary PPA relating to order back log, brand and other acquisition related intangible assets. The estimated
useful life for a large proportion of the order back log is two years and a minor proportion of the order back log
has an estimated longer useful life. Brand has an estimated indefinite useful life. The PPA is expected to be
finalized no later than December 31, 2024.

The Caverion Financial Statements are stated in Euros. For purposes of the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial
Information and the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Other Information, such financial statements have been
converted into SEK using (i) the Central Bank of Sweden closing rate as of March 31, 2024 (€1.00 to SEK
11.525) for balance sheet items, (ii) the Central Bank of Sweden average exchange rate for the period between
January 1, 2024 and March 31, 2024 (€1.00 to SEK 11.279) for the income statement for the three months ended
March 31, 2024, (iii) the Central Bank of Sweden average exchange rate for the period between January 1, 2023
and December 31, 2023 (€1.00 to SEK 11.477) for the income statement for the year ended December 31, 2023
and (iv) the Central Bank of Sweden average exchange rate for the period between January 1, 2023 and March
31, 2023 (€1.00 to SEK 11.097) for the income statement for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and (v)
the Central Bank of Sweden average exchange rate for the period between January 1, 2023 and March 31, 2024
(€1.00 to SEK 11.498) for the income statement for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information and the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Other Information has
not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the U.S. Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, the regulation of the European Union (EU) 2017/1129, U.S. GAAP or IFRS. Neither the
adjustments nor the resulting pro forma financial information have been audited or reviewed in accordance with
any generally accepted auditing standards. The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information and the Unaudited
Pro Forma Financial Other Information should be read in conjunction with the historical condensed
consolidated and consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of the Issuer, Assemblin Financing and
Caverion included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Assemblin,”_ _“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of_
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Caverion,” “Risk Factors—Anticipated pro forma adjustments_
_to our financial information may not materialize as anticipated” and “Risk Factors—The Unaudited Pro Forma_

Notes:

(1) The unaudited financial data for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 has been derived by subtracting the consolidated financial information for the
three months ended March 31, 2023 from the consolidated financial information for the year ended December 31, 2023 and adding the consolidated
financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The financial information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 has been
prepared for illustrative purposes only, is not necessarily representative of our results of operations, cash flows or financial position for any future period
at any future date, and is not prepared in the ordinary course of our financial reporting.

(2) Pro Forma EBITA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA and other ratios derived
therefrom are non-IFRS measures. We define Pro Forma profit/loss for the period as profit/loss for the year/period of the Assemblin Group and/or the
Assemblin Financing Group, as applicable, and the Caverion Group for the applicable period adjusted for the pro forma effect of the Assemblin Financing
Acquisition and the Caverion Combination as if they had occurred on January 1, 2023. We define Pro Forma EBITA as Pro Forma profit/loss for the
period before income taxes, net financial items and amortization of intangible assets. We define Pro Forma Adjusted EBITA as Pro Forma EBITA
adjusted for items affecting comparability, which are categorized as acquisition, integration and start-up costs, restructuring costs, transformation costs
and other items affecting comparability, as described under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—
_Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Assemblin—Items Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations” and “Management’s Discussion_
_and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Caverion—Items Affecting_
_Comparability of Results of Operations.” We define Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as Pro Forma EBITA before depreciation of property, plant and_
equipment. We define Pro Forma Adjusted Run-rate EBITA as Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, respectively further adjusted to reflect certain synergies
related to (i) certain synergies related to the Caverion Combination and (ii) the pro forma EBITDA contribution of certain acquisitions that were
completed after April 1, 2023, but prior to March 31, 2024, as if such acquisitions had completed on April 1, 2023. The adjustments in Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, and amortization of intangible assets in the table below, are presented on an aggregated, Combined
Group basis with no other eliminations or adjustments and are compiled on a similar basis as the other Combined Group Data. See “Presentation of
_Financial and Other Information—Combined Group Data.” Investors should not consider Pro Forma EBITA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITA, Pro Forma_
Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA (a) as an alternative to operating profit/loss as a measure of our operating performance,
(b) as an alternative to cashflow from operating and investment activities as a measure of our ability to meet cash needs or (c) as an alternative to any
other measure of performance under IFRS. Pro Forma EBITA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted
Run-rate EBITDA as presented in this offering memorandum may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to
differences in the way these measures are calculated. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Presentation of Financial and Other
_Data—Non-IFRS Measures.” Investors should also note that Pro Forma EBITA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro_
Forma Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA as presented above are calculated differently from “Consolidated EBITDA” as defined and used in the Indenture.
See “Description of Notes—Certain Definitions” for a definition of “Consolidated EBITDA” in the Indenture. The following is a reconciliation of Pro
Forma profit to Pro Forma EBITA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA for the
periods presented.

Notes:

(a) These represent aggregates of the relevant items affecting comparability under Assemblin Adjusted EBITDA and Caverion Adjusted EBITDA.
See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Assemblin—Items Affecting Comparability of
_Results of Operations” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Caverion—Items_
_Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations.”_

(b) These represent aggregates of the relevant other adjustments affecting comparability under Assemblin Adjusted EBITDA and Caverion Adjusted
EBITDA, except excluding any costs related to the Triton Offer for Caverion. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations—Assemblin—Items Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations” and “Management’s Discussion and_
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Caverion—Items Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations.”_

(c) Reflects management’s estimate of the pro forma full twelve-month impact of certain acquisitions by Assemblin and Caverion that were
completed prior to March 31, 2024, as if such acquisitions had completed on April 1, 2023. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Assemblin—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Acquisitions” and See_
_“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Caverion—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of_
_Operations—Acquisitions.” The adjustments are based on each acquired entity’s historical EBITA or EBITDA, as the case may be, derived from_
its management accounts, as adjusted for its actual contribution to our results of operations since the date of its acquisition and as further adjusted
in a manner consistent with our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITA or Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, as the case may be, to the extent applicable and
the application of our accounting policies and other items.

(d) Reflects management’s estimate of the pro forma full twelve-month impact of cost synergies expected to be realized in connection with the
Caverion Combination, comprising SG&A savings consisting of overhead reductions such as reductions in managerial overlap and administrative
overlap, both on a Group and divisional level, which are expected to be realized within the first 100 days of the Caverion Combination (with
57% of these initiatives actioned as of April 30, 2024 and the remainder expected to be fully executed in the first half of 2024), as if the
Combination were completed and such synergies implemented on April 1, 2023. The adjustments are based on Caverion’s historical EBITA or
EBITDA, as the case may be, derived from its management accounts, as adjusted for its actual contribution to our results of operations since the

61


-----

date of its acquisition and as further adjusted in a manner consistent with our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITA or Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, as
the case may be, to the extent applicable and the application of our accounting policies and other items. The above synergies do not reflect all of
the expected synergies that have been or will be achieved from the Caverion Combination nor those that may be included in covenant calculations
under relevant finance documents, including in respect of the Existing Notes or the Notes. In addition, there will be costs associated with realizing
these synergies, but we anticipate that the costs for realizing the presently quantified SEK 180 million SG&A savings will be lower than their
run-rate benefit.

The pro forma adjustments to Pro Forma Adjusted Run-Rate EBITDA presented above are for informational purposes only and do not purport
to present what our results of operations would have been, nor do they purport to project our results of operations for any future period. Moreover,
the assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments to Pro Forma Adjusted Run-Rate EBITDA presented above are based on our current
estimates, and they involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be
materially different from any anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such pro forma financial
information. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Anticipated pro forma adjustments to our financial information may not
_materialize as anticipated.”_

(3) The unaudited as adjusted financial information presented herein has been derived from or developed by applying adjustments to our historical results
as of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, to give effect to the Transactions, including the Offering and the use of proceeds therefrom, as if
they had occurred on March 31, 2024 with respect to our consolidated statement of financial position data and April 1, 2024 with respect to data derived
from our consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. The unaudited adjustments are based upon available information and
certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The unaudited as adjusted financial information is presented for
informational purposes only. The unaudited as adjusted financial information does not purport to represent what our results of operations or financial
position would have been had the Transactions, including the Offering and the use of proceeds therefrom, actually occurred at the beginning of the period
or on the date indicated, and such information does not purport to project the results of operations or financial position for any future period or as of any
future date. The unaudited as adjusted financial information should be read in conjunction with the information contained in “Selected Historical
_Financial Information,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Assemblin,” “Management’s_
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Caverion” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto_
appearing elsewhere in this offering memorandum. The unaudited as adjusted financial information is not intended to represent pro forma financial
information prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X promulgated under the U.S. Securities Act or other SEC requirements or
IFRS.

(4) As adjusted cash and cash equivalents represent total cash and cash equivalents of SEK 799 million for the Assemblin Group and SEK 326 million for
the Caverion Group as of March 31, 2024, adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, including the Caverion Combination and the Offering and the use
of proceeds therefrom, as if they had occurred on March 31, 2024. As adjusted cash and cash equivalents does not give effect to the expected cash
generation post March 31, 2024. See “Capitalization.”

(5) As adjusted total net debt as of March 31, 2024 gives effect to the Transactions, including the Caverion Combination and the Offering and the use of
proceeds therefrom, as if they had occurred on March 31, 2024. As adjusted total net debt includes the principal amount of the Notes, the Existing Notes,
lease liabilities and other long-term debt, less as adjusted cash and cash equivalents. In addition, we will, as per the contemplated upsize of the RCF
Upsize have SEK 1,470 million and EUR 125 million of commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalization.”

(6) As adjusted interest expense represents interest payable on total debt for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, adjusted to give effect to the
Transactions, including the Caverion Combination and the Offering and the use of proceeds therefrom, which comprises: (i) the principal amount of the
Notes and the Existing Notes, (ii) lease liabilities of SEK 2,792 million and (iii) expenses and commitment fees related to our Super Senior Facilities
(assuming no utilization thereunder). Any hedging we may undertake in respect of our obligations has not been reflected.

###### Risks Related to Our Business and Industry

 Our business may be adversely affected by difficult geopolitical and economic conditions and other factors beyond our control

Our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the Nordic, European and global economies.
The demand for some of our services tends to be cyclical and can be significantly lower in an economic
environment characterized by lower household income and corporate earnings, lower levels of government and
business spending and slowdowns in the construction industry. Demand for our services depends in particular
on spending in residential and commercial construction in the Nordic region, Central Europe and the Baltics as
well as renovation and maintenance in industrial and infrastructure markets in these regions, and a prolonged
period of slow growth or economic contraction may reduce demand for our services. The level of activity in
these end-markets depends on a variety of factors that we cannot control, including:

- local, regional and global economic conditions, slowdowns and recessions;

- the policies of the countries in which we operate, including the policies of the central banks of Sweden,
Norway, Finland, Denmark, Germany, Austria and the Baltic Countries;

- the policies of transnational institutions, such as the European Central Bank and other institutions of the
European Union, which influence the performance of national economies in countries in which we
operate;

- the impact of any future pandemic outbreaks which may lead to lockdowns that restrict mobility and
economic activity; and

63


-----

- the level of demand in construction and in manufacturing and process industries, demographic trends,
capital spending and consumer confidence.

Unfavorable developments with respect to any or all of these or other factors can have a materially adverse
impact on the demand for the services that we offer, both in terms of decreased volumes and price levels.

Certain of these economic fluctuations may also come about from the changing geopolitical landscape. For
example, the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine by Russia that commenced in 2022 led to significant volatility in
financial markets and an increase in the prices of commodities, especially of energy products, for which Russia
holds a considerable share of the global market, which contributed to rising inflation rates in many countries
and supply chain disruptions, resulting in higher costs of raw materials, labor, and other essential resources
required for the Group’s operations. While inflation rates and commodity prices have come down from their
recent peaks in 2022, both remain elevated and there is ongoing uncertainty in the region due to these
geopolitical tensions. As a result, we may face challenges in sourcing materials at affordable prices. See “—
_Fluctuating commodity prices, including as a result of geographical conflict or macroeconomic factors, may_
_adversely impact our results of operations”. This can lead to increased costs of our services. Even if we are_
ultimately able to pass on such increased costs for our clients, this could make projects more expensive and
potentially less attractive. Although the Group does not have business activities or interests in either Russia or
Ukraine, these events have negatively affected the stability of the region and the wider European continent and
could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
Additionally, the terrorist attacks by Hamas in Israel on October 7, 2023 and the armed conflict that followed
in Gaza have raised geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and globally. The conflict has continued to escalate
and the related instability may have a material adverse effect on the global economy.

Additionally, our results of operations are impacted by changes in monetary and fiscal policy. See “—Changes
_in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results of operations.” On a_
macroeconomic scale, global credit and financial markets have recently experienced extreme volatility and
disruptions, including diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence and
economic growth, high inflation in Europe and other foreign markets, increases in unemployment rates and
uncertainty about economic stability. In response, central banks in major economies started increasing
benchmark interest rates in 2022, a process which may continue throughout this year and beyond. This could
result in, among other effects, decreased demand for our products by making it more difficult for our customers
to secure financing for projects on favorable terms and can, along with high inflation, decrease consumers’
disposable income. Additionally, higher interest rates increase our debt burden and if the current equity and
credit markets deteriorate, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult to complete, more
expensive or more dilutive. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms
could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy and financial performance.

One of our market drivers is activity in the new construction market, which is sensitive to general business and
economic conditions both regionally and worldwide, including the availability of credit, interest rates, inflation,
fluctuations in capital, the credit and mortgage markets, changes in tax laws affecting the real estate industry,
unemployment levels, and business and consumer confidence. The demand for some of our services is cyclical
to the construction market and correlates with swings in construction demand. The installation market is latecyclical, meaning that it correlates to some extent with the construction market but with less volatility and with
a time lag, given that periods of less new construction at the same time benefit from increased demand for
renovation and service assignments. The economic slowdown which commenced in 2022 saw a decline in new
housing production towards the end of the year and postponement of a limited number of planned projects.
While there are countervailing factors that serve to stabilize the installation market, a prolonged recessionary
environment can negatively affect both new construction and the installation market.

64


-----

We provide the majority of our services to the renovation and maintenance and related services markets, which
have historically been more resilient to macroeconomic changes and can tend to be countercyclical. Private
residential spend, as well as other sectors of the installation market, can be affected by high mortgage
delinquency and foreclosure rates and limitations in the availability of home improvement financing, which
may limit consumers’ spending during economic downturns, particularly on discretionary items, and affect their
confidence level, leading to continued reduced spending on home improvement projects. The impact of these
economic factors specific to the renovation and maintenance market may be further exacerbated by
unemployment levels.

Furthermore, as a result of pandemics or adverse public health developments, such as the COVID-19 pandemic,
our operations and those of our customers, subcontractors and suppliers, may experience delays, disruptions
and other adverse effects, such as suspension or reduction of operations, declines in sales activities, difficulties
in travel and communications, and regulatory restrictions, any of which could have a material adverse impact
on us as a result of, for example, a further reduction in demand for our services, delays and uncertainties in
project timelines, deteriorations in the ability of our customers and subcontractors to serve their contractual
obligations due to liquidity constraints or other financial difficulties. See “—Our success depends on effective
_project and site management, which could be impaired by a certain number of factors.”_

As a result, adverse developments in global financial markets, geopolitical events and general business and
economic conditions, including economic recessions, downturns or negative developments, pandemic
outbreaks or general weakness in the economies of the Nordic, Central European and Baltic countries could
adversely affect demand for our products and services, which would have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

###### We may not be able to successfully manage future growth

Our ability to manage our growth and integrate operations, technologies, services and personnel depends on
our administrative, financial and operational controls and our ability to create the infrastructure necessary to
exploit market opportunities for our services, as well as our financial resources. In order to compete effectively
and to grow our business profitably, we will need, on a timely basis, to maintain and improve our financial and
management controls, reporting systems and procedures, implement new systems as necessary, attract and retain
adequate management personnel, and hire, retain and train a highly qualified workforce. Furthermore, we expect
that as we continue to introduce new services and enter new markets, we will be required to manage an
increasing number of relationships with various customers and other third parties. This would typically require
us to attract, train and retain increasing numbers of highly skilled technical personnel and branch managers.
The failure or delay of our management in responding to these challenges could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and result of operations.

###### We operate in highly competitive markets

The market for installation and services is highly competitive. There are currently a large number of small, local
companies and a smaller number of relatively large regional, national and multinational companies operating
in our markets. We also expect that new competitors may develop over time as smaller enterprises become more
established and reliable and refine their service capabilities. The local market is highly fragmented with low
barriers to entry and our local units (which are our physical branches) compete with a large number of relatively
small local installers and service providers, some of which benefit from better operating efficiencies or lower
overhead costs than us. As a result, some of our competitors are able to offer lower prices than us and we may
not be able to effectively utilize our larger size and broader capabilities as a competitive advantage when
competing for local assignments.

Competition varies depending on business area, customer classification and geographic area. The principal
competitive factors in our business include the following:

65


-----

- the availability and cost of materials and supplies;

- technical product knowledge and expertise as to application and usage;

- consulting and other service capabilities;

- the ability to build and maintain customer relationships and positive customer experiences;

- a focus on safety;

- the effective use of technology to identify net revenue and operational opportunities;

- same-day delivery capabilities for certain services

- a capacity to perform work according to a customer’s desired schedule; and

- the pricing of services and the provision of credit.

Some of our current or future competitors may have greater resources or lower price discipline than we do, and
may use this advantage to further increase their market share. Competitors may also engage in aggressive
pricing tactics, which may lead to us having to reduce our prices in order to compete with them. For example,
in instances where new construction has declined, we have been subject to increased competition on smaller
projects due to increased price competition from local companies. Furthermore, we may expend significant time
and resources in order to prepare a bid or participate in a bidding process, at the end of which we may not be
retained. Even if we are awarded a contract, it may not yield the expected results. As a result of high competition,
therefore, we may not be able to maintain our competitive position in the markets in which we operate and our
net revenue, profitability and market shares may decline, which would have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

In addition, the nature of the markets in which we compete may attract new entrants, particularly from countries
with low-cost employment. Although we consider this risk to be relatively limited, in part, due to significant
levels of unionization and professional qualification requirements for workforce engaged in the installation and
services industry, competition with service providers that benefit from lower cost structures may challenge our
competitive position. Furthermore, in recent years, new construction methods have led to the introduction of a
range of new low-cost installation solutions. For example, as low-cost prefabricated housing construction
becomes more common, the demand for prefabricated building and housing components with pre-built lowcost installations may increase, which may have an adverse impact on the demand for our services. If we are
unable to respond to these shifts in demand, our sales may decline, which could have an adverse effect on our
financial condition and results of operations.

Increased industry competition could result in increased price competition, lower profit margins, a decline in
our market share and greater competition for qualified personnel. If we were to face such competition, our net
revenue, profitability and market shares may decline, which would have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

###### Our competitors continue to consolidate, which could cause the markets in which we operate to become more competitive and could negatively impact our business

There has been an increase in consolidation activity among our competitors in the markets in which we operate
due to several factors, such as customer need, supplier capabilities and competitive recognition of the benefits
of acquisition fueled growth, such as the ability to compete for larger projects and demand more beneficial
terms from suppliers. Should this continue, it could cause our markets to become more competitive as greater
economies of scale are achieved by our competitors. Customers are increasingly aware of the total costs of not
having access to consistent sources of supply at multiple locations. While we believe these customer needs

66


-----

could result in fewer numbers of competitors in the market, as our remaining competitors become larger and
capable of supplying their services on a more consistent and comprehensive basis, these consolidated
competitors may increase competition along the value chain.

We may fail to effectively participate in the industry consolidation for a variety of reasons, including antitrust
restrictions, which may limit the degree to which a large market participant such as us can acquire additional
competitors, as well as our substantial indebtedness, and we may not have the resources to compete for such
acquisitions. In addition, industry consolidation could make it more difficult for us to maintain operating
margins and could also increase competition for our acquisition targets and result in higher purchase price
multiples. We may also face increased difficulty in growing and maintaining our market share and increasing
our growth prospects.

###### Our growth strategy involves acquisitions, and we may experience difficulties identifying acquisition targets, integrating acquired businesses and achieving anticipated synergies

Growth through acquisitions is one of our key growth strategies. We regularly identify and evaluate acquisition
opportunities. Since January 1, 2021, excluding the Caverion Combination, we have completed the acquisitions
of an additional 45 companies in across each of our business areas. In addition, in April 2024 we completed the
Caverion Combination, a transformative transaction that extends our global footprint across the Nordic, DACH
and Baltic regions. See “Summary—Recent Developments—Caverion Combination” and “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Caverion Combination.” We may enter into binding agreements to acquire additional businesses_
that we expect to complement or augment our existing operations, including ones that may be considered
material acquisitions (such as the acquisition of Fidelix). There can be no assurance, however, that suitable
acquisition targets, particularly those that have the cultural fit and profitability that we seek out, will be
identified in the future, or that we will be able to finance such acquisitions on favorable terms. Furthermore,
acquisitions we have already made or future acquisitions may not be integrated successfully into our operations
and may not achieve desired financial objectives.

Financial sponsors and strategic buyers active in the same field as us and operating a similar acquisition strategy,
such as Instalco, Bravida and Nimlas Group, may make it difficult to find suitable acquisition targets and/or to
acquire these targets at attractive prices. There is a risk that we could pay more than an acquired company, or
its assets, is worth. Occasionally, due to merger control laws and regulations, the applicability of which depend
on the turnover of the acquisition target and our relative market position, a contemplated acquisition may be
subject to approval by relevant competition authorities and/or certain conditions may need to be fulfilled prior
to completion of the acquisition. For example, our acquisition of Fidelix, which was completed in September
2021, was subject to approval by the Finnish Competition and Consumer Authority (Fi. Kilpailu-ja
_kuluttajavirasto). To receive final approval, we had to prepare a divestment plan to address an identified_
competitive situation. In receiving approval from the Finnish Competition and Consumer Authority for the
Caverion Combination, we had to make a small divestment of an operation with 11 FTEs. If we fail to find
attractive acquisition targets, or if such targets may only be acquired on terms that are not commercially viable,
it could have an adverse effect on our ability to implement our growth strategy, which may affect our
competitiveness and lead to an adverse effect on our results of operations.

Any acquisitions of businesses entail numerous operational and financial risks, including:

- higher than expected acquisition and integration costs;

- the possibility that we could pay more than the acquired company or its assets are worth;

- the possibility that we may not identify appropriate acquisition targets, complete future acquisitions on
satisfactory terms or realize expected synergies or cost savings within expected timelines;

67


-----

- unforeseen expenses, delays or conditions may be imposed upon the acquisition, including due to
required regulatory approvals or consents;

- exposure to unknown liabilities;

- difficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of acquired businesses with our existing
operations and personnel;

- diversion of management’s attention from our day-to-day business;

- impairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers of acquired businesses due to changes in
management and ownership and the restructuring of logistics and IT systems;

- the inability to retain key employees of acquired businesses;

- difficulty avoiding labor disruptions in connection with any integration, particularly in connection with
any headcount reduction; and

- the incurrence of substantial debt.

The occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
condition.

In addition, there can be no assurance that, following integration into our Group, an acquired operation will be
able to maintain its customer base consistent with expectations or generate the expected margins or cash flow.
Although we analyze each acquisition target, our assessments are subject to a number of assumptions
concerning profitability, growth, interest rates and company valuations. We may have difficulties in
implementing our business model within an acquired company due to various factors, including conflicting
corporate culture. There can be no assurance that our assessments of and assumptions regarding acquisition
targets will prove to be correct and actual developments may differ significantly from our expectations.

In agreeing to acquire entities, we generally make certain assumptions and determinations on, among other
things, future net revenue and earnings, based on our investigation of the respective businesses and other
information then available. We cannot assure you that our assumptions and determinations will prove to be
correct or that liabilities, contingencies or other risks previously not known to us will not arise. Further, to the
extent there are breaches of any purchase agreement governing an acquisition, we may not be able to fully
enforce such breach of representations and warranties or to fully recover for losses we sustain as a result. In
addition, we may be limited in our ability to acquire companies depending on the concentration of ownership
in specific markets and our relative market position. Any such unanticipated risks, liabilities, contingencies,
losses or issues, if realized, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

Furthermore, acquisitions of companies expose us to the risk of unforeseen obligations with respect to
employees, customers, suppliers and subcontractors of acquired businesses, public authorities and other parties.
We cannot ensure that there will not be unexpected risks or obligations. Such obligations, were they to
materialize, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

###### Our competitive position could be adversely affected by changes in technology and industry standards

Our business requires a high level of technical expertise for a wide variety of services. We need to constantly
adapt our expertise in response to technological innovations, as well as industry standards, product instructions
and customer requirements. New technology or changes in industry and customer requirements may render
some of our services obsolete, excessively costly or otherwise unmarketable. As a result, we must continuously

68


-----

enhance our expertise and the efficiency and reliability of our services in order to remain at the forefront of
industry standards and customer requirements. If we are unable to adapt to ever-changing technologies and
customer requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner, our competitive position will suffer and our
prospects for growth will be impaired, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Maintaining our competitiveness requires that we are able to meet our customers’ requirements related to
matters such as technology, quality, timeliness of deliveries and level of costs. The strong emergence of the
Internet of Things, the Industrial Internet and demand for automation in recent years had provided us with an
opportunity to gear our product and service offering increasingly towards automation, but we operate in a
competitive market and an inability to meet the changing requirements of customers faster than our competitors
or deliver services at a competitive price may lead to loss of customer accounts and loss of customers to
competitors, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, result of operations and financial
position. Maintaining competitiveness and the ability to meet customer requirements, especially in a tightening
market situation, may require for example significant investments in new technology, training personnel and
development of the offering. Such investments may also require external financing, the availability, terms and
conditions of which depend on the market situation prevailing at each time.

In recent years, technological development and increasing demands in the end-market for an efficient and
economic construction process have increased demands on suppliers, installation and service providers,
building contractors and other parties in the installation and service market value chain. These demands are also
related to the heavy carbon footprint of the construction industry. In parallel, new construction methods have
led to the introduction of a range of new low-cost installation solutions. For example, as low-cost prefabricated
housing construction becomes more common, the demand for prefabricated building and housing components
with pre-built low-cost installations may increase, which may have an adverse impact on the demand for our
services. If we are unable to respond to these shifts in demand, the requests for our services may decline, which
could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.

Additionally, we have adopted certain practices, policies and common standards to define our environmental,
social and governance (“ESG”) approach in order to deliver long-term social, environmental and economic
values across our business. However, investors may expect us to implement additional or different ESG
standards or goals, such as reducing our carbon footprint by cutting CO2 emissions faster than initially planned,
in order to maintain their investments or before making any further investments in us. These expectations may
be caused or accentuated by new disruptive business models in our industry, incorporating elements such as
new technologies, working procedures and price models. As a result, we may be required to implement more
stringent ESG targets or standards so that our existing and future investors and lenders remain invested and
make further investments in us. If we are not effective in addressing ESG matters or achieving relevant
sustainability goals, trust in us may suffer and our business and/or our access to capital could be harmed. In
addition, we may incur additional costs and require additional resources for monitoring and reporting in order
to comply with increasing ESG requirements. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and financial position.

###### Security threats, security breaches or any significant failure or interruption of our IT systems could adversely affect our business

We use and are dependent upon information systems and other technology to conduct and manage our business.
We rely on IT systems to monitor, administer and bill our services, communicate with our customers, manage
our employees and gather information upon which our management team bases their decisions on in relation to
our operations. The administration of our business is increasingly dependent on the use of these systems. Our
ability to efficiently run and monitor our decentralized organization is dependent on a well-functioning
information technology system integrated throughout the organization. In order to manage our growth and
improve our performance, we must maintain and continuously upgrade and improve these technology systems

69


-----

and processes. We may not be able to develop and implement, on a timely basis, necessary technology systems,
projects, systems, procedures and controls required to support the growth and development of our operations,
which may lead to a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Additionally, system failures or disruptions resulting from computer viruses, hackers or other causes could have
an adverse effect on our business. While we periodically undertake a review to improve our security levels, any
shortcomings or any other unresolved security deficiencies may be exploited by hackers or malicious actors
and lead to system disruptions in our IT system, loss of data or may affect our operations in other respects.

Data security breaches and other data security incidents may also result from internal threats, such as theft,
misuse, unauthorized access or error by employees, contractors and other third parties with otherwise legitimate
access to our systems. Given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of IT disruptions, there can be
no assurance that any security procedures and controls that we have implemented will be sufficient to prevent
cyberattacks from occurring. We may not be able to detect a breach of our systems in a timely manner, or at all,
and, even if we are able to detect such breach, we may be unable to remedy such incident in a timely manner,
or at all, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Any security breach or
incident that we experience could result in unauthorized access to, misuse of or unauthorized acquisition of our
users’ data, the loss, corruption or alteration of this data, interruptions in our operations or damage to our
computers or systems. We may have to expend significant capital and resources to mitigate the impact of such
an incident and to develop and implement protections to prevent future occurrences. Breaches of our systems
may also subject us to fines, penalties, litigation and government action, each of which may negatively impact
our business.

In addition, pursuant to contracts with third-party vendors, we outsource the operation and maintenance of
certain of our IT systems to effectively manage our IT resources and improve cost efficiencies. As a result, we
rely on our outsourcing partners to deliver these services. Their failure to perform satisfactorily could have a
material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

###### Anticipated pro forma adjustments to our financial information may not materialize as anticipated

We present certain information herein on the basis of certain estimates and assumptions to present for the twelve
months ended March 31, 2024 management’s estimate of, among other things, the pro forma full twelve-month
impact of certain acquisitions that were completed prior to and after March 31, 2024, in each case, as if such
acquisitions had completed on April 1, 2023 (based on each acquired entity’s historical EBITA or EBITDA, as
the case may be, derived from its management accounts, as adjusted for its actual contribution to our results of
operations since the date of its acquisition and as further adjusted in a manner consistent with our Presentation
of Financial and Other Data to the extent applicable and the application of our accounting policies and other
items).

Each of the adjustments is based on our current estimates, and involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions and
other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any
anticipated future results. None of the as adjusted and _pro forma_ consolidated financial information and
underlying assumptions has been audited, reviewed or verified by an independent accounting firm or other third
party. The adjustments and assumptions used in preparing these metrics may prove to be inaccurate or may be
affected by other factors that have not been accounted for, including if any of the risks set out in these “Risk
_Factors” are magnified. As such, they should not be considered in isolation or be used as a substitute for an_
analysis of the operating results of our Group and no undue reliance should be made in respect of such
information.

Any failure to realize the anticipated pro forma adjustments to financial information could materially and
adversely affect our business, result of operations and financial condition.

###### Our success depends on effective project and site management, which could be impaired by a certain number of factors

For many of our projects, we provide a broad range of services with high technical complexities. For example,
in our Assemblin Electrical business area, we install complex electrical infrastructure in hospitals and other
commercial buildings and in our service business area, we provide maintenance and periodic repair of these
installations, for which a high level of technical skill is required. In order to ensure that the projects we take on
are effectively conducted and profitable, we need to have a high degree of project and site management
expertise, especially in evaluating the costs of providing our services to the relevant customer and in
maximizing efficiency in providing the contracted services throughout the term of the contract. In general,
accurate project planning and calculation of cost estimates for installation projects depend on certain key
factors, including the type of contract (for example performance contracts, where we are responsible for
installation activities according to the customers’ design, or “turn-key” contracts, where we are responsible for
both design and installation activities) and the type of pricing (e.g. fixed price, unit prices or prime cost principle
(cost plus overhead and profit)). For example, the risks associated with the calculation of a fixed price under a
“turn-key” contract are generally more significant in comparison to a performance contract with payment in
accordance with the cost-plus principle. Our fixed-price contracts are based largely on estimates and
assumptions of projected costs. The actual amount of time and costs involved in carrying out a project may
differ from estimates as these estimates depend on a wide range of parameters, some of which are difficult to
forecast at the beginning of a project.

Specific factors that can affect our performance and profitability include our ability to accurately determine the
costs of providing the contracted services in the context of a particular project, our ability to measure the
personnel and other resources that we need to deploy in order to fulfil our contractual obligations on an ongoing
basis, our ability to control services provided by subcontractors or to influence the performance of such
subcontractors or other service providers, and unforeseen technical difficulties that could cause project delays
or unscheduled project downtime. The challenges related to project management could be magnified by the
growth of our business, as we may be unable to staff each project with suitably qualified personnel. See “—Our
_success is highly dependent on the ability to recruit and retain technical and other key personnel.” Moreover,_
our ability to effectively manage our projects or deliver our services may be affected by factors beyond our
control, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, where we experienced delays in several installation projects due to
the closing of construction sites.

If, due to ineffective contract planning or management or otherwise, we are unable to efficiently and profitably
render our services, we could experience increased contract execution costs, difficulty in obtaining timely
payment for our services or harm to our reputation, which could materially adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

###### We bear the risk of cost overruns in many of our projects and, as a result, we may experience reduced profits or, in some cases, losses under these projects if the cost increases are above our estimated amounts

We are exposed to various risks related to projects, for example, price calculation, contractual terms and
conditions, schedule, liquidated damages, and project management. Management of costs and productivity is
particularly important in larger projects. If we make mistakes in calculating and pricing projects, the expected
profitability levels of such projects may fall short or may never be reached.

We base our prices for our fixed-price contracts largely upon estimates and assumptions of projected costs. The
timetable of execution and/or cost structure of our projects can differ from bid estimates because both depend
on a wide range of parameters, some of which are difficult to forecast at the beginning of a project, such as the
accessibility of the work site, the availability of qualified personnel, adverse weather conditions, supply chain

71


-----

disruptions and increases in the prices of petroleum or raw materials used in the materials we purchase for
installation in our customers’ sites (for example, copper with respect to cables) which we may not be able to
pass on through re-invoicing to our customers. If our estimates or assumptions prove to be inaccurate,
circumstances change in a way that renders our assumptions and estimates inaccurate, or if unexpected
complexities in project execution arise, we may incur costs higher than those that we estimated, cost overruns
may occur and we could experience reduced profits or a loss for affected projects. Project risk assessment is
part of our standard project management processes, and it is possible that risks may be identified both in ongoing
projects and in new projects that may result in write-downs and unexpected costs. For example, in Finland, due
to poor project management and purchasing related problems, three units experienced significant losses in late
2022, impacting the business area’s profitability in the fourth quarter. In 2021, Caverion made write-downs
from separately identified major risk projects in the amount of EUR 4.0 million. However, it is possible that
further risks may emerge in regard to this project or other projects.

Project risks such as problems related to project management, project execution and profitability could lead to
project write-downs and provisions, and to disputes and litigations, which in turn could have a material adverse
effect on our business, result of operations and financial position. In the past, such risks have materialised and
despite all the actions and efforts taken by us, project-related risks are likely to materialise at least to a certain
extent also in the future.

We also are exposed to increases in energy prices and prices for raw materials, especially in light of recent
rising and unpredictable inflation and due to geo-political tensions between Russia and other nations, that we
may be unable to pass on to our customers. Additionally, in certain circumstances, we guarantee project
completion or the achievement of certain acceptance and performance testing levels by a scheduled date, as
well as provide warranties to our customers for a certain period (generally five years) after project completion.
Although we seek to procure performance guarantees for our projects from insurance companies and banks for
up to 10 per cent. of the project’s value, a failure to meet schedule or performance requirements typically results
in additional costs to us, and, in some cases, it may create liability for consequential and liquidated damages.
In certain circumstances, some providers of performance guarantees may determine we are no longer qualified
to receive such guarantees, in which case, we would need to find alternative providers. Performance problems
for existing and future projects could cause our actual results of operations to differ materially from those we
anticipate and could damage our reputation within our industry and our customer base.

###### Our success is highly dependent on the ability to recruit and retain technical and other key personnel

Our future success depends on our ability to continue to identify, attract, train, retain and motivate a sufficient
number of highly skilled technical personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense. We may be unable to
successfully attract, assimilate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel. Failure to do so could harm our
business and growth, and ultimately our profitability. In particular, it may be difficult to find qualified personnel
in regions that are experiencing a growth in demand for the services that we provide. In addition, our continued
success depends largely on our ability to retain our technical and key personnel. The departure of significant
numbers of our highly skilled personnel could impair our ability to execute our business plan and growth
strategy, cause a loss of customers, reduce revenues and adversely affect employee morale. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to retain or attract an adequately skilled labor force necessary to operate
efficiently and to support our business strategy or that labor expenses will not increase as a result of a shortage
in the supply of these skilled personnel.

In addition, our activities require a wide range of continually evolving skills in order to keep up with changes
in the sectors in which we operate. We may be unable to find qualified candidates, train staff in new methods,
and recruit and train managers.

72


-----

Our operations may be impacted by pandemics and other public health incidents and we may incur significant
costs in maintaining employee health and safety requirements. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic,
we faced decreased access to qualified labor due government mandated lockdowns which led to closure of
borders and decreased labor mobility, incurred costs with maintaining appropriate health and safety measures
and experienced increased sick leave, which particularly affected our services business for which we rely on
the technical skills and institutional knowledge of our existing employees that cannot be readily replaced with
subcontractors. Additionally, as our operations expand, we may face increased work accidents and illness (both
in frequency and severity).

In addition, during periods of rapid economic growth, we may encounter problems in recruiting and retaining
qualified employees, as well as experience increased staff costs during these periods, or a decrease in the quality
of the services we provide, all of which could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

###### A majority of our balance sheet assets consist of intangible assets, which are subject to impairment testing and may affect future results of operations

Our intangible assets are substantial and consist primarily of goodwill.

We capitalize goodwill relating to acquisitions, which is calculated as the difference between the historical cost
and fair value of an acquired business and the fair value of our share of the acquired business’s identifiable net
assets at the time of acquisition. Goodwill from the acquisition of operations is recognized as an intangible
asset. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment testing at least annually. The identification and
measurement of impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units. Accounting for
impairment contains uncertainty because management must use judgment in determining appropriate
assumptions to be used in the measurement of fair value. The estimates of fair value of reporting units are based
on the best information available as of the date of the assessment and incorporate management assumptions
about expected future cash flows and contemplate other valuation techniques. For more information see our
financial statements included in this offering memorandum. An adverse development in our business activities
may require us to recognize impairment charges to write off all or a part of the carrying amount of our goodwill
and other intangible assets. If an expense or impairment loss must be recognized, it could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

There is significant judgement required in the analysis of a potential impairment of goodwill and other
intangible assets. The future development of the macroeconomic environment, pandemics, unsuccessful
acquisitions or other factors could lead to possibly significant impairments to be recognized in the future, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any of these developments could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or on our ability to service or otherwise
make payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness.

###### Our business, strategy implementation and internal control functions could be adversely affected if we fail to effectively maintain our decentralized organization and to attract and retain skilled managers, personnel and key executive officers and directors

Our ability to continue to implement our strategy (See “Business—Our Strategy”) successfully depends upon
the services of a small number of key executive officers and directors, including the Group management team.
There can be no assurance that these individuals will continue to make their services available to us in the
future. The loss of or diminution in the services of one or more of our key executive officers or directors, or our
inability to attract, retain and maintain new key executive officers or directors, could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Implementing our business strategy and maintaining our competitive position also largely depends on our
decentralized organizational structure in which branch managers retain substantial autonomy regarding the
management of the operations and customer accounts, and project managers are primarily responsible for the
carrying out of individual projects. We rely heavily on our branch managers for the success of a branch. Each
branch manager has the responsibility for recruiting and retaining a quality workforce and cultivating customer
loyalty. Each branch manager manages the operations of the branch, which includes recruiting, dispatching and
paying of employees, meeting the needs of our customers, maintaining customer satisfaction, selling our
services to new customers, as well as controlling costs through accident prevention, and complying with
applicable laws and regulations. Our future growth and financial performance depends on our ability to hire,
train and retain qualified managers from a limited pool of qualified candidates. We are dependent upon the
services of our employees and their respective local customer relationships, as well as on the skills and expertise
of our employees in particular projects or particular markets. We may not be able to retain such employees in
the future, and such employees could leave us for competitors or form competing businesses themselves.
Despite our decentralized model, we also depend upon the services of our management. Any inability to attract
or retain an adequate number of qualified branch managers, project managers, key executive officers or other
skilled employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

###### Our decentralized operational structure exposes us to regulatory risks

Since our operations are decentralized, with approximately 369 local units across the Combined Group as of
March 31, 2024, our ability to efficiently run and monitor our decentralized organization is particularly
dependent on the skills and expertise of our employees, particularly our branch managers and project managers.
Furthermore, while we believe decentralization is a key element of our business model and an important element
for the implementation of our strategy, decentralization necessarily places significant control and decisionmaking powers in the hands of local project and branch managers. As a result, it may be more difficult to
determine the sufficiency of existing routines and procedures for internal governance and controls, including
guidelines and policies, such as those addressing anti-competition, anti-cartel, anti-bribery and money
laundering rules and regulations. Furthermore, there is a risk that local managers will not comply with our
internal policies or processes or that we will not successfully implement future compliance policies, update
existing control procedures and compliance policies and maintain efficient reliable IT systems required to
effectively monitor our operations. Any breaches of the foregoing risks and regulations, on a particular project
or local branch level, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

###### Based on economic and other conditions impacting the markets in which our facilities are located, as well as the overall performance of individual branch locations, we may be required to close or dispose of under-performing units

We may have to close under-performing units from time to time as warranted by general economic conditions
and/or weakness in the local markets in which we operate. Furthermore, we engage in periodic reviews of
branch performance and may decide to close or dispose of units based on under-performance, poor cash flow
and other considerations. Our under-performing units may not be successful in generating future profits. If we
fail to identify units that are under-performing in a timely manner or fail to take appropriate remedial measures
to support, close or dispose of an under-performing branch in a timely manner, such failure may have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

In addition, future branch closures could result in our reduced presence in certain of our local markets, which
could potentially have an adverse effect on our ability to provide our customers comprehensive services
throughout the Nordic region, which could adversely impact our reputation and results of operations. In
addition, branch closures may result in administrative and restructuring costs that could have a material adverse
impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

###### We may incur liabilities for the actions of our employees

Our employees deliver services within buildings and at locations owned or operated by our customers. As a
result, we may be subject to claims in connection with damage to property, business interruptions, unauthorized
use of the customer’s property or willful misconduct or other tortuous acts by our employees or people who
have gained unauthorized access to premises through our business operations. Such claims may be substantial
and may result in adverse publicity for our Group. Accordingly, these claims could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

###### Damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects

Our reputation is important to our ability to market our services and secure new customers. Our historical
success is attributable, in large part, to our reputation as a leading and reliable provider of a broad range of
services, particularly services requiring a certain level of technical expertise, and this reputation has
strengthened our business and helped to facilitate our expansion. Although we closely monitor the quality of
our services, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to protect our business against damage to our reputation
vis-à-vis our customers, potential customers and, more generally, in the geographic regions and business sectors
in which we operate. Any damage to our reputation or brand as a result of adverse litigation, breach of
procurement laws or regulations, third-party challenges to contracts won in public procurement procedures,
failure to meet contract deadlines or specialized performance requirements, or for any other reason, could have
a material adverse effect on our marketing and ability to obtain projects from customers, as well as our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

###### A part of our net revenues is attributable to contracts awarded through tender processes, which can result in substantial costs and loss of revenue if we fail to compete effectively

A part of our net revenue generated from contractor assignments is attributable to contracts that are awarded
through tender processes, where price is often an important factor in determining which contractor to select,
especially with regard to projects in the public sector (such as municipalities, regional and governmental
authorities). For that reason, it is important for us to ensure that a prudent and realistic price is set in any tender
process, so that we do not overprice or underprice our services compared to our competitors. Some of our
competitors may be willing to offer a lower price than us, reduce staff costs, accept lower profit margins or
expend more in capital to obtain or retain customers. As a result, we may not be successful in winning awards
on commercially attractive terms over our competitors. In addition, competitive bidding results in substantial
costs and presents a number of risks, including substantial investments in terms of cost and time required to
prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may or may not be awarded to us, and the need to accurately
estimate the resources and costs that will be required to service any contract we are awarded, often already in
advance of the final determination of the full scope of the project. Our competitors may challenge projects
awarded to us in a competitive bidding process, which could result in the requirement to resubmit bids, the
termination, reduction or modification of the contracts awarded to us and an opportunity cost for other contracts
we might otherwise have pursued and won, all of which could have an adverse effect on our profitability and
results of operations. See “—We are party to public sector contracts, which may be affected by political and
_administrative decisions, and we are subject to risks inherent in public contracts”._

###### We are party to public sector contracts, which may be affected by political and administrative decisions, and we are subject to risks inherent in public contracts

Public sector customers account for a significant portion of our net revenue. The success and profitability of
our public sector business may be influenced by political considerations. It may also be affected by political
and administrative decisions concerning levels of public spending. In certain cases, due to applicable
regulations, such as European Union tender rules, certain terms of public sector contracts, such as pricing terms,

75


-----

contract period, the use of subcontractors and the ability to transfer receivables under contract, could result in
less flexibility than comparable private sector contracts. Public sector contracts can, if entered into or prolonged
in violation of applicable tender rules, be declared invalid by a court of law, or if questioned by a third party
competitor, risk being terminated by the public sector customer. Certain of our public sector contracts may be
subject to challenge on these grounds and could be declared invalid if they are found to be in violation of
applicable public procurement law.

Moreover, decisions to decrease public spending may result in the termination, delay or downscaling of public
sector contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition. Historically, our performance has been linked, in part, to the ability and willingness of local, regional
and national governments to allocate public funds to infrastructure and other publicly funded projects, as well
as our ability to bid successfully for these contracts. Public sector spending, in turn, generally has been
dependent on long-term general macroeconomic conditions. A decrease in public sector spending as a result of
a deterioration in Nordic, European or global economic conditions, changes in governmental policy or other
reasons, including future pandemic outbreaks, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and
results of operations. There is a risk that a fall in public sector spending in the countries in which we operate
will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation.

Contracts in the public sector are also subject to review, audit and monitoring by local authorities to ensure
compliance with laws and regulations, which could result in adjustments to reimbursable contract costs or, if
we are charged with wrongdoing, possible temporary or permanent suspension or sanctions from participating
in government programs. In addition, for public sector clients, a failure by our subcontractors to comply with
applicable laws, regulations or client requirements may result in fines or suspension being imposed on us.
Although we believe that we comply with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will
not be found in violation of any such laws or regulations, and we could be subject to fines, penalties and other
sanctions, including exclusion from participation in tenders for public contracts. Any such event would have a
material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.

###### Changes in the laws and regulations governing public procurement could have a material impact on our business

As a government contractor, we are subject to a number of procurement regulations, requirements and
limitations relating to the conduct of business relationships and the formation of purchasing contracts, including
prohibitions on certain business practices that could be construed as bribery, public corruption or unfair
competitive practices. Although we maintain policies regarding compliance with these regulations, there can be
no assurance that our employees, subcontractors, agents and partners, or the public sector entities with whom
they contract, will not act in violation of such policies and/or applicable laws and regulations. See “—Our
_decentralized operational structure exposes us to regulatory risks”. Furthermore, if a public sector entity were_
to violate applicable procurement laws or regulations in connection with contracts entered into with us or our
marketing activities, the relevant authorities or a competitor could seek enforcement action against us. Any such
violation, even if prohibited by our policies, could result in civil or criminal penalties, the loss of business or
harm to our reputation and, accordingly, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or
financial condition.

In addition, awards under public procurement processes may be subject to challenge or rescission based on
actual or alleged procedural deficiencies in the tender process, even after we have made significant expenditures
associated with winning such an award. We (or a public sector customer) may face actions seeking to challenge
prior awards and we may not be successful in securing a contract in any re-tendering process, which could have
a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

###### We are exposed to risks related to business ethics and compliance

There is a risk that our group-wide policies addressing topics such as bribery, corruption and anticompetitive
practices, and related training activities, are not sufficient in order to ensure that our employees and suppliers
will comply with external statutory legal requirements, contractual obligations or our internal guidelines and
policies. As a consequence and through no direct action on our part, we may inadvertently become involved in
or associated with illegal or unethical activities such as cartelization, division of markets, price collusion or
bribery. If we are unable to identify and address such problems in a timely manner, or prevent legal, regulatory,
compliance or other violations by our employees, suppliers or agents, we could incur significant fines, civil and
criminal liability penalties and damage of reputation, which could have an adverse effect on our business and
results of operations.

###### We face risks relating to legal, employment, civil, tax, administrative and competition proceedings that may have an adverse effect on our business, result of operations and financial position

We are subject to numerous risks relating to legal, employment, civil, tax, administrative, regulatory and
competition proceedings to which we are, or in the future might be, a party or in which we are otherwise
involved or which could develop in the future. Given the nature of our business, our companies are involved in
various disputes and legal proceedings relating to their day-to-day activities. These disputes and legal
proceedings concern claims made against us for allegedly defective or delayed delivery. In some cases, the
collection of receivables by us may result in disputes and legal proceedings. There is a risk that the client
presents counter claims in these proceedings. The outcome of claims, disputes and legal proceedings is difficult
to predict. Write-downs and provisions are booked following the applicable accounting rules. Any lawsuits or
the threat thereof, regardless of their outcome, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources.

Most legal proceedings typically include claims by customers or other third parties, related to work conducted
by us or our subcontractors, disputes related to delays or payment or employment disputes. In particular, we
may encounter difficulties in meeting contractual performance obligations, which may result in the incurrence
of penalties for non-performance or due to a delay by us in the performance of our contractual obligations. In
addition, we rely on third-party partners, equipment manufacturers and subcontractors to complete some of our
contracts. As such, claims involving customers, suppliers and subcontractors may be brought against us, and by
us, in connection with our contracts. Claims brought against us could include back charges for alleged defective
or incomplete work, breaches of warranty and/or late completion of a project and claims for cancelled projects.
The claims and back charges can involve actual damages, as well as contractually agreed-upon liquidated sums.
These claims, as well as claims that we bring against customers or other third parties, if not resolved through
negotiation, could result in lengthy and expensive litigation or arbitration proceedings.

We occasionally bring claims against project owners for additional costs that exceed the contract price or for
amounts not included in the original contract price. These types of claims occur due to matters such as ownercaused delays, increased unit prices or changes from the initial project scope that result, both directly and
indirectly, in additional costs. Occasionally, these claims can be the subject of lengthy arbitration, litigation or
third-party expert proceedings, and it can be difficult to accurately predict when these claims will be fully
resolved. When these types of events occur and unresolved claims are pending, we may invest significant
working capital in projects to cover cost overruns pending the resolution of the relevant claims.

Additionally, in June 2018, Caverion reached a settlement for its part with the German Federal Office (“FCO”)
in a cartel case that had been investigated by the authority since 2014. The investigation concerned several
companies providing technical building services in Germany. Caverion Deutschland GmbH (and its
predecessors) was found to have participated in anti competitive practices between 2005 and 2013. According
to the FCO’s final decision issued on July 3, 2018, Caverion Deutschland GmbH was imposed a fine of EUR
40.8 million. At the end of March 2020, the FCO issued its final decision on the cartel case against the other
building technology companies involved in the matter. There is a risk that civil claims may be presented against

77


-----

the involved companies, including Caverion Deutschland GmbH. Some civil claims presented against Caverion
Deutschland GmbH have been settled in the years between 2021 and 2024 in the aggregate amount of
approximately EUR 20 million. While some civil claim cases are still possible, Caverion does not expect further
settlements of comparable magnitudes to those that have been settled so far.

As part of Caverion’s co-operation with the authorities in the cartel matter, Caverion identified activities
between 2009 and 2011 that were likely to fulfil the criteria of corruption or other criminal commitment in some
of its client projects executed in that time. Caverion brought its findings to the attention of the authorities and
supported them in investigating the case. At the end of June 2020, the public prosecutor’s office in Munich
informed Caverion that no further investigative measures are intended and that no formal fine proceedings
against Caverion will be initiated related to those cases.

Caverion also faces potential risks from a new breach of contract claim concerning a construction project that
was initiated in 2015 and completed in 2021. As of April 2024, it is alleged that a claim amounting to
approximately EUR 27 million has been filed against Caverion Deutschland GmbH. However, Caverion has
not yet been officially served with this claim, preventing a full assessment of its implication and, as of March
31, 2024, no additional provisions have been recognized in conjunction with the alleged court filing pending
further information and analysis.

Throughout the years, the matter has been subject to various settlement discussions, but remains unresolved.
Should the claim be formally served, Caverion intends to defend its position and intends to file a counterclaim
for damages due to unpaid amounts and related claims. The initiation of formal proceedings, expected to
commence with an initial oral hearing in late 2024, will allow the court to provide a preliminary evaluation.
This may open further avenues for settlement negotiations.

When we determine that a significant risk of a future claim exists against it, we record provisions in an amount
equal to its estimated liability. Our insurance or provisions may not cover all claims that may be asserted against
us, and any claims asserted against us, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm our reputation. There
is a risk that we will not be successful in defending ourselves in pending or future litigation claims or similar
matters, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

###### Changes in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results of operations

The demand for our services is impacted by monetary and other government policies in each of the countries
in which we operate, including policies that have the effect of encouraging or discouraging construction, such
as long-term interest rates, tax policies, policies encouraging or discouraging labor mobility and migration, the
availability of financing or subsidies, the allocation of government funding for public infrastructure programs
and safety regulations that encourage or discourage the use of certain materials and products. Interest rate
changes, for example, affect demand for residential and non-residential structures, which in turn affects sales
of our services that serve these activities. Interest rate changes also affect our customers’ ability to finance
purchases and can impact the ability of our suppliers to finance the production of parts and components
necessary to deliver the services we sell. In addition to changing interest rates, central banks and other policy
arms of many countries take actions to vary the amount of liquidity and credit available to such country. For
example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, governments globally stepped up monetary and fiscal policies to
fight the economic effects of lockdowns and containment measures, lowering interest rates and undertaking
monetary stimulus on a large scale. Due to various factors, including rising inflation, such measures are now
being unwound and major central banks started raising interest rates in 2022. See “—Our business may be
_adversely affected by difficult economic conditions and other factors beyond our control.” Changes in liquidity_
and credit policies, including the reduction or elimination of favorable tax or other stimulus programs and
reversing of monetary policy measures, could adversely impact our customers, markets and suppliers, any of
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

###### Fluctuating commodity prices, including as a result of geographical conflict or macroeconomic factors, may adversely impact our results of operations

The prices of petroleum, copper, steel, aluminum and other commodities used in the products we install can be
volatile and our cost base is affected by energy costs. The global economy, and Europe in particular, recently
witnessed a period of historical volatility in commodity prices, especially energy, due to a combination of
different factors, including high energy demand in the context of the economic recovery following the COVID19 pandemic and the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. While commodity prices have
come down form their peak in 2022, prices generally remain elevated. Significant fluctuations in the cost of the
commodities used in products we use as a part of the services that we deliver may adversely affect our results
of operations and financial condition.

We are not always able to quickly or effectively react to price increases by our suppliers or pass-through
increased costs to our customers. Many of our contracts allow us to pass through cost increases to our customers.
However, short-term changes in the costs of raw materials, some of which are subject to significant fluctuations,
are not always passed on to our customers, and we do not currently enter into forward sales, commodity,
derivative or hedging arrangements to establish a price in advance for the purchase of future raw materials.
Therefore, rapid fluctuations in the cost of specific equipment or tools, or components included in the products
used by us may adversely affect our production costs. In addition, if prices decrease for commodities, we may
have inventories purchased at prices higher than prevailing market prices. Any delay in our ability to, or inability
to, pass on material price increases to our customers could adversely impact our business, results of operations,
financial condition and cash flows.

Prices and the availability of energy and fuel, which affect our business in part due to our car fleet of
approximately 10,294 vehicles on a Combined Group basis as of December 31, 2023, are subject to political,
economic and market factors that are outside our control. For example, we are currently operating in a period
of geopolitical instability resulting from the ongoing military conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the
Middle East, which have significantly contributed to increased energy costs. While the length and impact of
these conflicts are unpredictable, they have led and may continue to lead to significant volatility in commodity
and energy prices. As a consequence of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, electricity and natural gas prices rose to
unprecedented levels in 2022 and have remained elevated, increasing our production costs. The outbreak of
hostilities in the Middle East following the terrorist attacks by Hamas on Israel on October 7, 2023 has further
increased price volatility. Any further significant increases in fuel or energy prices, as a result of any of the
aforementioned factors, or any increased costs relating to emissions control requirements that have been or may
be imposed in the future, including due to climate change-related legislation, could have an adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Additionally, for a small part of our services business we give service performance guarantees, for example
guarantees for a certain maximum energy usage level. Any failures or delays in reaching the guaranteed levels
and high energy prices could increase our costs and decrease customer satisfaction. In addition, we offer energy
management solutions, and although high energy prices may increase the demand for our energy efficiency
solutions in the future, high and/or volatile energy prices may in the short to medium term decrease or postpone
customer’s investments into such services or shift demand towards other providers, thereby decreasing demand
for our services and reducing profitability.

###### Any failure of our third-party subcontractors or strategic partners to satisfactorily perform their obligations may hurt our reputation, business and results of operations.

We offer certain of our services to our customers through various third-party service providers engaged to
perform these services on our behalf. However, we retain responsibility for the work performed by these
subcontractors. Accordingly, we are exposed to risks relating to managing subcontractors and the risk that these

79


-----

subcontractors may fail to perform the agreed-upon services satisfactorily and on a timely basis, which could
affect our ability to perform our obligations (which could lead to contractual monetary penalties) or meet our
customers’ expectations and comply with applicable regulatory requirements. In extreme cases, performance or
other deficiencies on the part of our subcontractors could result in a customer terminating our contract. A
termination could expose us to financial liabilities, damage our reputation and impair our ability to compete for
future contracts. In addition, in the event a subcontractor provides unsatisfactory services on our behalf, we
could be required to make additional investments or provide additional services to ensure the adequate
performance and delivery of the contracted services. In addition, we are exposed to the operational controls of
our subcontractors, including with respect to the qualifications of their personnel and their compliance with
labor and immigration laws. Our subcontractors may maintain inadequate insurance coverage or inadequate
financial resources to honor claims resulting from damages or losses inflicted by such subcontractors on our
customers.

We constantly manage and monitor the performance of our subcontractors. However, the failure of
subcontractors to meet their contractual obligations or comply with applicable laws or regulations could harm
our reputation, as well as result in customer losses and financial liabilities, any of which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Similarly, much of our business, particularly with respect to installation in new construction projects, derives
from our strategic partnerships with leading construction companies that hire us as subcontractors.

In our contracts with these construction companies, we often agree, along with all other subcontractors on the
project, to have joint and several liability for the performance of the construction company’s obligations under
the supply contract. To the extent one of our strategic partners encounters financial difficulties or otherwise
becomes unable to perform its obligations under the construction contract, we may incur substantial liabilities,
which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

###### We rely on third-party suppliers, and if we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers, or if there is a significant interruption in our supply chains or significant fluctuation in the prices of our product supply, our results of operations could be adversely affected

Our ability to offer a wide variety of services to our customers is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate
product supply from manufacturers or other suppliers at attractive prices. For the year ended December 31,
2023, we estimate that Assemblin’s top ten suppliers accounted for 36 per cent. of its total supply costs. The
Caverion Group’s top ten suppliers for the year ended December 31, 2023 represented 26 per cent. of its total
supply costs. We may not be able to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers that can satisfy
our standards for quality and price and our need to access products and supplies in a timely and efficient manner.
We may be required to replace a supplier if its products do not meet our quality, price or safety standards. Our
results of operations and inventory levels could suffer if we are unable to promptly replace a supplier that is
unwilling or unable to satisfy our requirements with a supplier providing similar products. The loss of, or
substantial decrease in the availability of, products from our suppliers, or the loss of a key supplier, could
adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

In addition, supply interruptions could arise from shortages of raw materials, labor disputes or weather
conditions affecting products or shipments, transportation disruptions, geopolitical disturbances, including the
ongoing Russo-Ukrainian conflict, the conflict between Israel and the surrounding region, or other factors
beyond our control, including closures related to any future pandemics. Short-term and long-term disruptions
in our supply chain would result in a need to maintain higher inventory levels as we replace similar products, a
higher cost of goods and ultimately a decrease in our net revenue and profitability. A disruption in the timely
availability of our goods by our key suppliers and the failure by our suppliers to continue to supply us with

80


-----

products on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, may result in a decline of our operating margins and have
a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.

The cost of our services historically have been volatile and subject to fluctuations arising from changes in supply
and demand, economic conditions, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulation and
trade policies, as well as from periodic delays in the delivery of our products. We have a limited ability to
control the timing and amount of changes to prices that we will pay for our products. In addition, the supply of
our products fluctuates based on available manufacturing capacity. A shortage of capacity, or excess capacity,
in the industry can result in significant increases or decreases in market prices for those products, often within
a short period of time. Even where we are able to increase our prices to our customers, we may be unable to
increase our prices in sufficient time to absorb price increases by our suppliers. Such price fluctuations can
adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

###### We are dependent on our relationships with strategic partners in the building and services industry. The failure to maintain these relationships could result in the loss of business and, as a result, materially adverse effects on our operating performance

Our business, particularly with respect to installation in new construction projects, is dependent in large part on
our long-standing relationships with leading construction companies across Europe, such as NCC, Skanska,
PEAB, YIT, Q-gruppen and Granit. For example, we were part of an installation group that was hired by
building contractor Skanska to conduct the planning and design of the installation work for the new health care
building in the Malmö hospital area in 2015. In September 2019, Skanska entrusted the same installation group
with the implementation phase of that project, an assignment that was, at the time, worth approximately SEK
1,669 million in total and of which we were to be responsible for SEK 1,067 million. The project is still in
progress and completion is expected sometime in 2024.

Our opportunities to partner with these types of construction companies could be adversely affected if: we are
unable to achieve the objectives under our arrangements in a timely manner, or at all; our partners become
unable, unwilling or less willing to invest in new property development due to poor general market conditions,
their financial condition or other circumstances, many of which are beyond our control; we disagree with a key
partner regarding strategic direction, the economics of our relationship or other matters; we are unable to
successfully manage multiple simultaneous projects with such partners; our strategic partners breach or
terminate their contract with us; our partners become competitors of ours or enter into agreements with our
competitors; applicable laws and regulations, domestic or foreign, impede our ability to enter into strategic
arrangements; or as we enter into additional or consolidation in the construction markets limits the number of
potential industry partners. If any of these events occur, or if we fail to maintain our agreements with our
strategic partners and collaborators, we may not be able to further develop our business or generate sufficient
revenues to support our operations. Additionally, our business could be negatively impacted if any of our
industry partners undergo a change of control, assign the rights or obligations under any of our agreements or
cease to be a going concern. We may be exposed to the credit risk of certain of our customers and, in addition,
our liability to customers under guarantee provisions may materially and adversely affect our earnings.

We sell installation and services solutions to our customers through contracts that are not secured by collateral
or other security and therefore bear the risk that our customers will be unable to pay amounts due to us. Our
products are sold to customers in industries that may experience fluctuations in demand based on economic
conditions, energy prices, seasonality, consumer demand and other factors beyond our control. These industries
include the construction industry. We may not be able to limit our potential loss of revenues if a significant
number of customers are unable to pay amounts due to us on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

81


-----

At the same time, we generally provide guarantees for completed projects as to the proper operation and
conformance to specifications of our installations and services. The failure of our installations to operate
properly or to meet specifications may increase our costs by requiring additional engineering resources and
services, the replacement of parts and equipment or monetary reimbursement to a customer. We have in the past
received guarantee claims, are subject to guarantee claims and we expect to continue to receive them in the
future. To the extent that we incur substantial guarantee claims in any period, our reputation, our ability to
obtain future business and our earnings could be adversely affected.

###### We may be exposed to higher liability for our deliveries than expected

In certain of the countries in which we operate, it is typically a precondition to participate in the tendering
process and be awarded a contract to accept established industry specific agreements that often do not contain
customary limitations of liability which we would otherwise seek to include in our agreements. Even if
limitations of liability had been agreed, their effectiveness may be uncertain and depend among other factors
on the applicable law in the relevant jurisdiction. For example, delays in agreed contracts and other contractual
breaches may result in liabilities for us, which may be independent of the diligence of our operations. It is not
possible to quantify such liabilities, and hence the materialisation of liability may have a material adverse effect
on our reputation, business, result of operations and financial position.

###### A change in supplier rebates due to the loss of our leading market position or other market conditions or a deterioration in our commercial relationship with one or more key suppliers could adversely affect our income and gross margins

The terms on which we purchase products from many of our suppliers enable us to receive a rebate based on
the volume of our purchases. These rebates effectively reduce our costs. Our ability to earn and negotiate rebates
is critical to the success of our business. If market conditions change or if we lose our leading market position,
suppliers may respond by changing the terms of some or all of these purchasing programs to our detriment. Any
such changes could lower our gross margins or revenues. Furthermore, a loss of market share could result in a
decreased demand for our services, which could cause our volume requirements for certain products to decline.
If we are unable to meet specified volume thresholds for certain suppliers, we may not receive favorable rebates,
which could increase our costs and decrease our gross margins.

In addition, some of our suppliers are not obligated under long-term supply agreements to continue to sell to
us. We have relatively few sources of supply for some of the products that we purchase, and in some cases we
rely on a small group of suppliers for certain key products. In addition, the lead time involved in the
manufacturing of some of these components can be lengthy. If certain of our key suppliers become unwilling
or unable to supply us with components meeting our requirements, we may not be able to organize additional
or replacement suppliers in a timely manner, or at all. Moreover, we maintain low levels of inventory and our
suppliers deliver directly to our work sites, which prevents us from being able to provide replacement supplies
on our own should one or more or our suppliers fail to meet our supply requirements. The inability or
unwillingness of our suppliers to provide timely delivery of products necessary for our installations and services
projects could cause our services to be disrupted and our results of operations to decline.

###### Our business model could be negatively affected by changing industry standards regarding the treatment of annual volume rebates in cost-plus contracts

We benefit from annual volume rebates in our contractual arrangements for raw materials with our suppliers
due to our size within the Swedish construction industry, which provides us with the ability to source materials
at a cost-effective price. Furthermore, in contracts that we enter into with our customers, which are priced on a
cost-plus basis, annual volume rebates are excluded for the purposes of said cost-plus pricing. This exclusion
allows us to maintain a competitive edge by leveraging our overall purchasing power, which results in reduced

82


-----

costs, except for the purpose of pricing cost-plus contracts, resulting in favorable margins in our cost-plus
contracts.

If there are changes in industry practices, regulatory requirements, or customer demands that mandate the
inclusion of annual volume rebates in cost-plus contracts, our current advantage may be eroded as our margins
would be reduced, impairing our pricing competitiveness and profitability. Additionally, the inclusion of annual
volume rebates in the future could require us to revisit our pricing models, renegotiate contracts or develop
alternative strategies to maintain our market position. Failure to adapt to such changes effectively could result
in us being unable to price our cost-plus contracts competitively and profitably, loss of market share and adverse
effects on financial performance. Such changes in industry standards may adversely affect our business, results
of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

###### Our operations could be adversely affected if a significant number of our customers terminate their services contracts prior to the end of the contractual term or select another provider following the expiration of their contracts

We perform some of our service work for customers under contracts with a stated term and, in some cases, with
termination clauses permitting the customer to cancel the contract at the customer’s discretion following the
expiration of an agreed notice period. There can be no assurance that our customers will not exercise their rights
to terminate their contracts prior to expiration or that we will be successful in negotiating new contracts with
customers as such contracts expire. We generally execute our business through numerous small contracts
(including multiple contracts for the same customers) and, therefore, any cancellation of a contract or a number
of contracts would not ordinarily have an adverse effect on our results of operations. However, contract
cancellations or dissatisfaction with our services may damage our reputation and make it more difficult for us
to obtain similar contracts with other customers, in which case our business and results of operations would be
adversely affected.

###### Amounts included in our estimated order backlog may not result in actual revenue or translate into profits, and our estimated order backlog is subject to delays, customer bankruptcy, accounting errors and unexpected adjustments and is therefore an uncertain indicator of future results of operations

As of March 31, 2024, our Combined Group Order backlog was SEK 32,713 million, which represented 80 per
cent. of our Combined Group Net revenue for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. Although our backlog
only includes expected sales under committed contracts with customers, there can be no assurance that these
contractual terms would not change, and that the backlog will result in an actual recognition of revenue within
the period initially anticipated, if at all. In addition, certain contracts included in our estimated order backlog
may not be profitable. We may experience variances in the realization of our estimated order backlog because
of project delays or cancellations resulting from weather conditions, project deferrals or delays, scope
adjustments, external market factors and economic factors beyond our control. If our estimated order backlog
fails to materialize as we anticipated, our business, financial condition or results of operations would be
materially and adversely affected. Accordingly, our estimated order backlog as of any particular date is an
uncertain indicator of future revenue or earnings.

Our order backlog does not provide a precise indication of the time period over which we are contractually
entitled to receive such revenue and there is no assurance that such revenues will be actually received by us in
the time frames anticipated, or at all. Our order backlog is computed based on facts known and assumptions
deemed appropriate at the computation date. Although under our unilateral termination rights relating to defined
termination events, our order backlog is based on the full contractual period, as we estimate that, based on our
operating history and course of dealing with our customers, these contracts are more likely than not to reach
their full term and be continued for the duration of their option periods.

83


-----

Unforeseen events or circumstances, including, for example, the termination or scaling down of service
contracts, may affect the backlog and could negatively impact our earnings and financial position. There can be
no assurance that the revenue projected in our order backlog will be realized or, if realized, that it will result in
profits. Because of contract terminations or suspensions and changes in contract scope and schedule, we cannot
predict with certainty when, or if, our order backlog will be achieved. We can provide no assurance that we will
not receive additional terminations, and, even where a contract proceeds as scheduled, it is possible that the
customer may default and fail to pay amounts owed by it. To the extent we are unable to realize the pipeline of
revenue associated with contracts in our backlog due to material delays, terminations or payment defaults, our
business, financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected. See “—Our business may be
_adversely affected by difficult economic conditions and other factors beyond our control” and “Management’s_
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Assemblin—Key Factors Affecting_
_Our Results of Operations—Seasonality.” Finally, our definition of backlog may not necessarily be the same as_
that used by other companies engaged in activities similar to us. As a result, the amount of backlog reported by
us may not be comparable to the backlog reported by such other companies.

###### We may incur liabilities that are not covered by insurance

We maintain insurance policies to protect our core businesses against loss or potential liability arising from
contracting parties and third party claims. Risks that generally are insured include claims that naturally may
occur in our business operations, for example, damage on our property, business interruption, damage on third
parties’ property or public and production liability. Additionally, we obtain insurance coverage for certain
specific larger projects. Nevertheless, not all claims are insurable and there can be no assurance that we will not
experience major incidents that are not covered by our insurance. Furthermore, the occurrence of several events
resulting in substantial claims for damages within a calendar year may have a material adverse effect on our
business. In addition, our insurance costs may increase over time in response to any negative development in
our claims history or due to material price increases in the insurance market in general. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to maintain our current insurance coverage or do so at a reasonable cost.

###### We are exposed to warranty claims following project completion during warranty periods

We are exposed to warranty claims that may arise following project completion during warranty periods. Under
the standard general conditions used in the industry (in Sweden, AB 04, ABT 06 and AB-U/ABT-U 07, in
Norway, NS 8405/8407/8415/8417, in Finland, YSE 1998, in Denmark, AB 18 and ABT 18, in Austria, local
laws and ÖNORM and in Germany, VOB/B,), warranty liability subsists for a period of between two and ten
years from approval of the total works. Our warranties will be covered under the Guarantee Facility, which
typically covers between 2 and 15 per cent. of the value of each project. The liability period begins with a
warranty period, which can continue for up to ten years. In certain cases, if we receive a longer warranty period
for materials or goods, this longer warranty period also applies between us and the customer. Under the standard
general conditions, we are liable for defects which appear during the warranty period. In case of defects
appearing after the warranty period, but before the end of the period of liability, we will have continued liability
if the defect is substantial and was caused by negligence. The liability for defects primarily includes an
obligation to rectify the defect without delay and at our cost. Under the standard forms of contracts, we are
liable to indemnify the customer for damage caused by a defect. Our liability for damages also comprises
measures taken or omitted by our employees as well as by our contractors, suppliers and other persons engaged
by us. Claims against us during the warranty period occur in the ordinary course of our business and as of March
31, 2024, warranty provisions amounted to SEK 114.0 million for the Assemblin Group and EUR 21.2 million
for Caverion. See “—We are involved in disputes from time to time, the outcome of which may be uncertain,
_and insurances or provisions made may be insufficient to cover our losses and other liabilities resulting from_
_such disputes.”_

84


-----

###### We are party to public sector contracts and is thus subject to risks inherent in public contracts

A portion of our local customers are public institutions and these accounted for a significant portion of our net
revenue for the financial year ended December 31, 2023. Public institutions contract with us through public
procurement processes with strict specifications. Our work for public institutions includes both project and
service assignments. Examples of customers within this customer group include pension funds, county councils.
The future prospects and profitability of our public sector business may be affected by political and
administrative decisions concerning levels of public spending, which may be impacted by monetary and fiscal
policy, as well as general economic conditions. See “—Our business may be adversely affected by difficult
_economic conditions and other factors beyond our control” and “—Changes in government monetary or fiscal_
_policies may negatively impact our results of operations.” In certain cases, due to applicable regulations, such_
as public tendering rules in the EU, certain terms of public sector contracts, such as pricing terms, contract
period, the use of subcontractors and the ability to transfer receivables under a contract, could result in less
flexibility than comparable private sector contracts. Public sector contracts can, if entered into or prolonged in
violation of applicable tender rules, also be declared invalid by a court of law, or if challenged by a third-party
competitor, be terminated by the public sector customer. Certain of our public sector contracts may be subject
to challenge on these grounds and could be declared invalid if they are found to be in violation of applicable
public procurement law. In addition, awards under public procurement processes may be subject to challenge
or rescission based on actual or alleged procedural deficiencies in the tender process, even after we have made
significant expenditures associated with winning such an award. We (or a public sector customer) may face
actions seeking to challenge prior awards and we may not be successful in securing a contract in any retendering process, which could have an adverse effect on our business and net revenue.

Contracts in the public sector are also subject to review and monitoring by local authorities to ensure compliance
with laws and regulations prohibiting anti-competitive practices. If we are found to be in violation of any such
laws or regulations, we could be subject to fines, penalties and other sanctions, including exclusion from
participation in tenders for public contracts. Any such event would have an adverse effect on our reputation,
business and results of operations.

###### If we fail to ensure safe work environments for our employees, we could be exposed to significant financial losses, as well as civil and criminal liabilities

Our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to the maintenance of safe conditions in
the workplace. The industry in which we operate involves a certain degree of operational risk, such as working
with high voltages, heat and at heights, which cannot be fully eliminated by procedures implemented to address
them. These hazards can cause personal injury or death, severe damage to or destruction of property and
equipment and other consequential damages and could lead to the suspension of operations and large damage
claims and, in extreme cases, criminal liability.

If we were to fail to implement any safety or other procedures with respect to our sites, or if the procedures we
implement were deemed to be ineffective, our employees or others may suffer injury and we could incur
significant financial losses. In addition, we could be found liable for failing to comply with government
regulation dealing with occupational health and safety. Occurrence of any of these events could cause a
materially adverse effect on our operations and profitability. Our failure, or the failure of one of our
subcontractors, to comply with applicable regulations or to maintain a safe work environment could result in
substantial fines, claims relating to violations of social and working environment legislation or the revocation
of licenses. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to claims relating to employees’ working
conditions. Any such claims, or increased costs resulting from such claims or regulatory changes, could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

85


-----

Additionally, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, our worksites and offices had to implement and maintain
measures designed to stop the spread of the virus, including sanitation, social distancing and mask wearing. If
there is another pandemic outbreak in the future, we may need to implement similar policies again.

New technology and the implementation of new work processes, services, tools and machinery may also have
unforeseen effects on the working conditions of our employees. In addition, our employees may be exposed to
materials that, although not currently considered harmful, could in the future be deemed health hazards, as was
the case with asbestos. Unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase project costs for our customers and
raise our operating costs. Any of the foregoing could result in financial losses, which could have a material
adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

###### Failure to comply with transfer pricing regulations may result in the payment of additional tax or penalties by us

The markets in which we operate have transfer pricing regulations that require transactions involving associated
companies to be at arm’s length. Arrangements between members of our Group, such as intra-Group
transactions involving management services, royalties, IT service fees, cash-pool arrangements, intra- Group
loans and consultancy fees, are typically carried out on an arm’s-length basis. However, if the tax authorities in
any relevant jurisdiction do not regard such arrangements as being made on an arm’s-length basis and
successfully challenge those arrangements, the amount of tax payable by the relevant member or members of
our Group, in respect of both current and previous years, may increase materially and penalties or interest may
be payable. Furthermore, any failure to file transfer pricing documentation evidencing the outcome of applied
pricing principles, should they be requested by the relevant tax authorities, may result in penalties.

###### We are exposed to risks in connection with derivative instruments and hedging transactions.

We use derivative financial instruments (primarily currency and interest rate swaps and interest rate ceilings)
to help limit and control foreign exchange and interest rate risks. Such transactions involve risks, particularly,
if the interest or exchange rate development differs from expectations. The projections and assumptions made
by our risk management team at the time when such transactions were entered into could prove to be incorrect
and the transactions could fail to limit the risks as intended or increase our costs. This could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we intend to hedge
some or all of our interest rate and currency risk under the Notes since the majority of our revenues are paid in
currency other than euros, which is the currency of the Notes. Such hedges are senior obligations of the Issuer
and rank pari passu in right of payment with the Notes and obligations under the Super Senior Facilities, and
together with the Notes, the Super Senior Facilities are secured by first-priority security interests over the
Collateral; provided, however, that, under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, certain hedges are “super
senior” in terms of the receipt of the proceeds of enforcement of Collateral until such super senior hedges and
obligations under the Super Senior Facilities have been repaid in full. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” If we were to default in making payments under the Notes, or if_
certain other credit events were to occur in relation to us and a credit-linked hedge of interest rate or currency
risk in respect of such Notes were to terminate or be closed out as a result, then, in relation to the mark-tomarket (“MTM”) value which would normally be payable by one party to the other on a termination or closeout of an equivalent hedge that was not credit-linked, either (a) we will be limited, where such MTM value
would otherwise be payable to us, in claiming against our hedge counterparty in respect of such termination or
close-out to an amount equal to the product of (i) such MTM value and (ii) the credit recovery rate for holders
of the Notes, such credit recovery rate being determined within a reasonable period after such termination or
close-out by reference to a market auction process or market quotations for such notes, or (b) no MTM payment
in respect of such termination or close-out will be due from either party, depending on the particular type of
credit-linked hedge into which we enter.

###### We are exposed to translation risk of currency fluctuations

Our business operations are characterized by a relatively low level of transactional currency risk since its
purchases and sales are made in the same local currency with minimal exposure to imported components. From
an accounting perspective, our biggest foreign exchange risk is relating to translation into Swedish kronor of
income statements and balance sheets of our subsidiaries with local reporting denominated in euro, Danish
kroner and Norwegian kroner. For Caverion, risk arises mainly from the recognized assets and liabilities and
net investments in foreign operations. We are working towards establishing the appropriate treasury policy to
manage the exchange rate risk of the Combined Group. In order to prepare our consolidated financial
statements, we must translate foreign currency assets, liabilities, net revenue and expenses into Swedish kronor.
For balance sheet items, foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates
applicable on the transaction date. For income statement items, foreign currencies are translated into the
functional currency at the average exchange rate applicable to the period. Consequently, increases and decreases
in the value of the Swedish krona against other currencies affect the amount of these items in our consolidated
financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. For Assemblin, a 5 per cent.
strengthening of the euro as of December 31, 2023 would have had a negative translation effect on equity of
SEK 3 million and the same increase in value of the Norwegian krone would have had a positive translation
effect on equity of SEK 3 million.

###### The residential, non-residential and infrastructure construction markets are seasonal and our business operations may be affected by adverse weather conditions

We experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for certain of our services, due primarily to weather and
holiday seasons. Although weather patterns affect our results of operations throughout the year, cold and wet
weather during the winter months has historically reduced construction activity primarily in the first quarter in
our markets. In contrast, our highest volume of net revenue historically has occurred in September through
December. Generally, during the winter months, new construction activity declines due to inclement weather
and to the holiday season. Public holidays and vacation, particularly in the months of June and July, also have
seasonality effects, because building projects or industrial production processes may slow or temporarily cease.
As a result, our results of operations may vary significantly from period to period. We anticipate that fluctuations
from period to period will continue in the future.

In addition, cold weather is less favorable for construction projects and delays installation work because it
hinders site accessibility. Adverse weather conditions, particularly during the winter season, could affect the
ability of our employees to perform efficient work outdoors in certain regions in which we operate. We may
experience reduced cash flow if unseasonal weather conditions persist, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

###### Changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax position could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

We are subject to complex tax laws in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes in tax laws could
adversely affect our tax position, including our effective tax rate or tax payments. In addition, tax laws in the
jurisdictions in which we operate, Europe and other international tax laws and regulations are extremely
complex and are subject to varying interpretations. We often rely on generally available interpretations of tax
laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We cannot be certain that the relevant tax
authorities are in agreement with our interpretation of these laws. If our tax positions are challenged by relevant
tax authorities, the imposition of additional taxes could require us to pay taxes that we currently do not collect
or pay or increase the costs of our services to track and collect such taxes, which could increase our costs of
operations and have a negative effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

87


-----

###### We occupy most of our facilities under short- and medium-term leases. We may be unable to renew leases at the end of their terms. If we close a facility, we remain obligated under the applicable lease

Most of our facilities are located in leased premises. Most of our leases are non-cancellable and short- or
medium-term. We believe that leases we enter into in the future will likely be on similar terms as our current
leases. We may be unable to renew our leases at the end of their terms, or the terms of such renewal may be less
favorable to us than those under the current leases. If we close a facility, we generally remain committed to
perform our obligations under the applicable lease, which includes the payment of the base rent for the balance
of the lease term. Over the course of the last few years, we closed a number of facilities for which we remain
liable on the lease obligations. Our obligation to continue making rent payments in respect of leases for closed
facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

###### We may be required to make further contributions to our pension schemes if the value of pension fund assets is not sufficient to cover potential obligations

Some of Assemblin’s white-collar employees in Sweden are covered by a defined benefit pension plan, which
is accounted for in accordance with IAS 19 under which we are required to provide agreed benefits to current
and former employees. Other employees have pensions that are recognized as defined-contribution. Caverion
also has defined benefit pension plans in Norway, Germany, Austria and Finland. In all of these plans the
pension liability has been calculated based on the number of years employed and the salary level. Most of the
pension plans are managed in insurance companies, which follow the local pension legislation in their
management. In Sweden, Caverion participates in a multi-employer defined benefit plan through Alecta.

A number of our Combined Group employees had defined benefit pensions. Of these, Assemblin’s Swedish
plan for electricity white-collar employees is unfunded and based on final salary, which provides employees
with benefits in the form of a guaranteed level of pension disbursements over their lifetimes and is recognized
as defined benefit for purposes of our financial statements. For the remaining white-collar Assemblin employees
in Sweden and all of Caverion’s employees in Sweden the defined-benefit pension obligations are secured
through insurance with Alecta and are accounted for as a defined contribution plan.

Pension scheme liabilities vary with changes to long-term interest rates, inflation, pensionable salaries and the
longevity of scheme members. Assemblin’s liabilities in respect of provisions for pensions decreased from SEK
788 million as of December 31, 2021 for the Assemblin Financing Group to SEK 548 million as of December
31, 2022 for the Assemblin Financing Group and rebounded slightly to SEK 644 million as of December 31,
2023 and SEK 678 million as of March 31, 2024 for the Assemblin Group, driven primarily by an increase in
market interest rates, which resulted in the assumed discount rate for defined-benefit obligations increasing
from 1.80 per cent. as of December 31, 2021 to 4.00 per cent. on December 31, 2022 and 3.30 per cent. for
December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024. The increase in liabilities in respect of provisions for pensions also
reflects the relatively greater proportion of plan participants that are not eligible for retirement, as compared to
the number of former plan participants that have retired. Changes to local legislation and regulations relating to
defined benefit plan funding requirements may also result in significant deviations in the timing and size of the
expected cash contributions under such plans. For example, actuarial loss and financial commitments related to
pensions liability amounted to SEK 68 million as of December 31, 2023, on a non-IFRS basis (comprised of
SEK 0 million for the Assemblin Financing Group as of May 2, 2023 and SEK 68 million for the Assemblin
Group for the eight-month period ended December 31, 2023). Increases in our pensions liabilities could
adversely affect our financial condition.

In accordance with the requirements of the pension administrator, we are required to provide bank guarantees
in respect of a portion of the Assemblin Group’s defined-benefit pensions obligations. In January 2024, we were
required to increase the amount of our SEK 375 million bank guarantee to SEK 410 million, of which SEK 320
million is incurred under the Pension Guarantee Facility and SEK 90 million is incurred under the Guarantee

88


-----

Facility. Our obligations with respect to (i) the Pension Guarantee Facility are secured on the Collateral on a
super super senior basis to the Notes and (ii) the Guarantee Facility are secured on the Collateral on a super
senior basis to the Notes. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—The Super Senior Facilities.”
Availability of the additional guarantee amounts under the Pension Guarantee Facility or the Guarantee Facility,
however, is subject to certain conditions, including compliance with certain financial covenants. Moreover,
lenders under the Pension Guarantee Facility may not be able to increase the size of their commitments
thereunder in time to satisfy the deadline set by the pension administrator or at all. If the Swedish pensions
regulatory authority requires us to provide bank guarantees of our pensions liabilities or increase the size of our
pre-existing bank guarantees in excess of the amounts that are available to us, this may result in additional
financial obligations being imposed on us by the regulator, which could have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition.

###### Work stoppages or strikes could adversely affect our business

We are required to comply with local labor law requirements (including in respect of minimum salary levels as
well as employee conditions) in the jurisdictions where our employees perform their work. Changes with regard
to labor laws in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could restrict our ability to utilize employees away
from their home jurisdiction, result in increased labor costs, including increases due to healthcare reforms or
minimum wage increase, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation
and financial condition.

Many of Assemblin’s employees are members of unions, and most of the employees who work in its warehouses
are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Caverion is party to collective labour agreements and similar
arrangements that cover the majority of Caverion’s own employees and subcontractors. We may encounter
strikes or other disturbances, or threats of strikes or disturbances occasioned by our unionized labor force and,
upon the expiration of existing collective bargaining agreements, we may be unable to reach new collective
bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or without work stoppages, strikes or similar industrial actions.
Our inability to negotiate satisfactory terms for new agreements would likely cause our labor costs to increase,
which would negatively affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass the additional costs on to our
customers.

When we acquire companies and integrate them into our existing operations, we occasionally enter into
negotiations to restructure or reduce the workforce at the acquired company. We may experience lengthier
consultations or even strikes, work stoppages or other industrial actions in the future, particularly when we are
engaged in restructuring and reducing our workforce. Any industrial action or threat thereof could disrupt our
operations, possibly for a significant period of time, and result in increased wages and benefits or otherwise
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

###### We are subject to numerous and complex environmental laws, regulations and other requirements which may result in material liabilities, costs and obligations.

Our business is subject to a broad range of environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we
operate. These laws govern, among other things, the generation, storage, handling and management of
dangerous goods and hazardous substances; waste classification and transportation; emissions and discharges
to air, water and land; the management of adverse amenity impacts on neighbouring properties; land
development and use; environmental impact assessments; the management of land and groundwater
contamination; permissions and approvals required in relation to activities; and land use and environmental
impacts. Many of these requirements have become more stringent over time, and new restrictions could be
imposed on our existing operations, making compliance costly, uneconomic or potentially impracticable in
some rare scenarios, noting that the likelihood of adverse scenarios arising will increase if environmental laws

89


-----

and regulations continue the current trend towards more stringent management of environmental impacts and
issues.

A key environmental issue for the business is the management of land, air and groundwater contamination. We
may handle, among others, refrigerants, pickling acids, heat transfer fluids, oils, solvents and asbestos in our
daily operations. We ensure the appropriate processing of hazardous waste and proactively identify each
project’s risks related to personnel safety, use of chemical substances and wellbeing at work, but nonetheless
environmental damage may occur in our operations, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations and future prospects.

Most jurisdictions in which we operate will generally adopt and apply a polluter pays approach to contamination
issues, although legal liability can extend beyond the person considered responsible for causing or contributing
to the contamination to the owners, occupiers and persons in management or control of a contaminated site. In
addition to the penalties that may be imposed for causing or contributing to contamination, environment
protection laws in many jurisdictions provide environmental authorities with the power to require contamination
to be investigated and (if necessary) cleaned-up by a range of persons, particularly the polluter, owner or
occupier of a contaminated site. The costs of implementing such measures can be significant.

Environmental legislation also typically includes the power to recover the costs associated with assessing and
managing contamination from persons who have caused or contributed to contamination by the authority, or a
person issued with a notice to undertake investigations and clean-ups (to the extent they are not responsible for
contributing to the contamination). There is also a trend towards providing a broader suite of enforcement tools
and notices to ensure compliance or undertaking of improvements or changes, and complementing this with the
ability to impose higher and more serious penalties (including the potential for criminal sanctions) on those
who fail to comply.

Any failure on our part to meet our legislative obligations and duties could incur penalties, become subject to
obligations to remediate conditions at current and former facilities and waste treatment or disposal locations,
result in approvals or licenses being revoked, incur capital expenditures to install or upgrade pollution control
facilities, become subject to prosecution (including the directors of the subject business), become subject to
third-party claims for property damage and personal injury, and/or attract other civil and criminal sanctions, as
a result of violations of or liabilities under such laws and regulations. Such enforcement could have an adverse
impact on our operations and financial condition and may restrict our ability to conduct its business
economically or prohibit some activities altogether.

###### Our reported receivables are based on estimates that may differ materially from the factual situation and may result in increased impairment losses.

We follow a policy in valuing trade receivables and the bookings include estimates and critical judgements.
According to the our policy, write-offs or provisions are booked on receivables when it is probable that no
payment can be expected. The estimates are based on experience in respect of write-offs realised in previous
years, empirical knowledge of debt collection, customer-specific collaterals and analyses as well as the general
economic situation of the review period. The majority of these receivables relate to disputes of change orders
and contracts. A receivable is impaired when payment is seen unlikely. If any of the counterparties fail to fulfil
their obligations towards us, this may result in increased impairment losses, which in turn could have a material
adverse effect on our result of operations and financial position and thereby. The revenue and result from longterm service agreements and project contracts is recognised on the basis of the percentage-of-completion
(“POC”) method and is therefore subject to a significant amount of estimates and only rarely corresponds with
the even allocation of the final overall result over the agreement. Due to the application of the POC method,
part of reliably estimated impairment losses are included in the cost estimate of the project and considered as
weakened margin forecast. We may at any given date have recognised a larger percentage of revenue compared

90


-----

to the actual technical completion rate of the project and therefore we may not in a timely manner be able to
identify profitability issues in projects. It cannot be excluded that the final recognised risk in relation to the
receivables differs from current estimates or that there is also risk associated with other receivables not currently
identified.

###### Risks Related to the Caverion Combination

 The Combined Group could encounter difficulties during the integration process that jeopardize the realization of the expected benefits.

Achieving the synergies and benefits anticipated in connection with the Caverion Combination will depend on
the timely and efficient integration of the Caverion Group’s operations, business culture and personnel into the
Group, among other factors, including those described in “—Our strategic objectives and financial and
_operational targets for the Caverion Combination are based on certain assumptions and estimates by_
_management that may prove inaccurate.” In particular, the integration may hold special challenges and expose_
the Combined Group to risks that could, among others, arise from the circumstances described below. The
following discussion is not meant to be exhaustive and, in addition, other risks and unexpected issues may arise
that we are not currently unaware of or unable to assess.

- _Commitment of management capacity: The integration of the Caverion Group into our operations has_
required and can be expected to continue to require significant resources in terms of time and attention
by management. If integration issues divert management from other responsibilities, the Combined
Group’s business could be adversely affected.

- _Possible loss of key employees: We depend on the experience of certain of our executives and talent in_
carrying our operations, and the Combined Group will depend on such efforts to undertake integration
activities and implementation our strategy. Should we be unsuccessful in retaining these employees, for
example due to potential uncertainty among employees regarding jobs, company locations or corporate
culture, this could impede efficient integration and leveraging the companies’ respective strengths. In
particular, know-how of managerial staff and talented employees could be lost, which could lead to
business disruptions. Uncertainty arising from the restructuring activities and the ongoing integration
activities may lead to higher turnover levels. As competition in the industry for qualified employees is
intense, the Combined Group may incur significant costs to replace departing key employees in a timely
manner.

- _Integration of ongoing operations and oversight: Our ability to compete effectively and integrate the_
Caverion Group depends on our being able to successfully adapt operating, management and oversight
practices to reflect the new composition of the management team and broader personnel. If the Caverion
Group’s senior management or key employees leave, the Combined Group’s ability to integrate the
Caverion Group could be impaired, which could have a significant negative impact on the know-how,
culture and operations forming part of the Caverion Combination.

- _Transaction and integration costs: Integration costs arise from advisory, legal, accounting, consulting_
and other advisory fees and expenses, investments in IT, business continuity and the adaptation of
quality, health, safety & environment systems, reorganization and restructuring costs,
severance/employee benefit-related expenses, public company filing fees and other regulatory expenses
and related charges. Certain of these costs are expected to be incurred prior to realization of
corresponding targeted benefits (if realized at all). If further unforeseen factors arise or known
integration steps or activities take longer or are more expensive than currently anticipated, the overall
costs of integration may rise above this level.

91


-----

- _Integration of key processes and procedures: We may suffer from unexpected challenges in the_
integration of the two businesses’ information, management, financial (including accounting), operating
and other internal systems and policies, internal controls and compliance procedures and the
coordination of a geographically dispersed business with differing business backgrounds, corporate
cultures and management philosophies, with the result that unexpected additional direct or indirect costs
may be incurred by the Combined Group.

- _Compliance Requirements: The combination of two businesses, with operations in a number of different_
countries within Europe entails risks related to navigating compliance and regulatory regimes that are
new to us, which will need to be identified and addressed in the course of the integration process.

Any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial
condition and prospects.

###### Our strategic objectives and financial and operational targets for the Caverion Combination are based on certain assumptions and estimates by management that may prove inaccurate.

With the Caverion Combination, we have expanded our footprint and leadership positions in Europe and we
expect the Caverion Combination to create significant value for the Group by achieving cost synergies of SEK
180 million, comprising SG&A savings consisting of overhead reductions such as reductions in managerial
overlap and administrative overlap, both on a Group and divisional level, which are expected to be realized
within the first 100 days of the Caverion Combination (with 57% of these initiatives already actioned as of
April 30, 2024 and the remainder expected to be fully executed in the first half of 2024).

The integration of two companies domiciled in different countries entails considerable challenges. Therefore,
the contemplated synergy effects may prove impossible to realize, in whole or in part, or on any targeted
timetable. Our strategic objectives, synergy and other operational targets and earnings impact expectations
related to the Caverion Combination are based on certain assumptions and estimates by management that may
prove to be inaccurate. Should any of our assumptions and estimates underlying expected targets prove
inaccurate, this could lead to the Caverion Combination falling short of these synergy forecasts and other
forecasts as well as market expectations.

The benefits of Caverion Combination may fail to fully offset the costs, including transaction and integration
costs, or any such benefits may not be the size or realized on the timing expected. Furthermore, our strategic
and targeted cost-reduction objectives are subject to change for a variety of reasons. For example, changes in
market conditions or other geopolitical factors may lead us to reassess target growth areas.

If our strategic objectives, operational targets and earnings impact expectations with respect to the Caverion
Combination are not met, or not met in full, or they take longer to realize than expected, and the Caverion
Combination turns out not to be accretive to our core earnings to the expected extent or within the expected
timeframe or at all, this could negatively affect our financial performance.

###### We may be forced to recognize impairment losses as a result of the Caverion Combination.

The Caverion Combination will require us to undertake an evaluation of the value of the Caverion assets and
determine accounting treatment for Caverion Combination. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business
_and Industry—A majority of our balance sheet assets consist of intangible assets, which are subject to_
_impairment testing and may affect future results of operations.” We expect to recognize a substantial portion of_
the difference between the amount paid for the Caverion Combination and the book value of Caverion’s equity
as goodwill and other intangible assets. During the year, these items must be tested for impairment whenever
there are indicators of impairment, and at least annually. If the business were to fail to develop as expected or
if any other business development affecting the historic Caverion Group’s operations were to occur that is not
anticipated, we may, in accordance with IFRS, be forced to recognize an impairment loss on such intangible

92


-----

assets and on any goodwill arising as a result of the Caverion Combination. In addition, we will need to evaluate
the accounting treatment of combined business, including potential deconsolidation of relevant businesses
where appropriate. These factors could result in the final purchase price allocation materially differing from the
amount assumed for purposes of the pro forma financial information included in this offering memorandum.

Significant impairment losses and asset write-downs could have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition and results of operations.

###### The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information and the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Other Information included in the offering memorandum is subject to significant limitations and may differ significantly from the actual performance of the Combined Group.

We have prepared pro forma consolidated financial information and pro forma consolidated other financial
information as of and/or for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, the financial year
ended December 31, 2023, the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 and as of and for to illustrate the effect of
the Assemblin Financing Acquisition and the Caverion Combination on the Issuer’s net assets, financial position
and results of operations. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Data—Pro Forma Financial Information.”
The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information and the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Other Information
was not prepared in accordance with the requirements of Article 11 of Regulation S-X issued by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information and the Unaudited Pro
Forma Financial Other Information has been prepared to illustrate the hypothetical effects that the Assemblin
Financing Acquisition and Caverion Combination might have had on the Issuer’s unaudited pro forma
consolidated statement of financial position as if the Caverion Combination occurred on March 31, 2024 or the
unaudited pro forma consolidated or unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of profit or loss
as if the Assemblin Financing Acquisition and the Caverion Combination occurred on January 1, 2023.In
connection with these adjustments, certain assumptions were made, all of which are reflected in the notes to the
Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information. The pro forma adjustments made are preliminary and subject to
change.

Only limited information is available at the date of the preparation of the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial
Information and the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Other Information and only a preliminary purchase price
allocation has been performed. This purchase price allocation includes certain estimates and assumptions in
order to assess the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The final purchase price allocation
will be carried out based on the actual total consideration transferred and the fair values of the acquired net
assets at the closing date Therefore, the final purchase price allocation may differ significantly from the
preliminary purchase price allocation performed for purposes of the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial
Information and the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Other Information. The fair value amounts assigned to the
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are preliminary and subject to change.

In addition, the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information and the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Other
Information does not reflect the cost of any integration activities or the expected synergies from the Assemblin
Financing Acquisition and the Caverion Combination. Due to its nature, the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial
Information and the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Other Information describes only a hypothetical situation
and neither reflects the actual net assets, financial position and results of operations of the Combined Group
after completion of the Assemblin Financing Acquisition and the Caverion Combination nor does it indicate the
future development of the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the Combined Group.

Furthermore, the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information and the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Other
Information does not reflect future exceptional charges resulting from the Assemblin Financing Acquisition and
the Caverion Combination or future events that may occur, including restructuring activities or other costs

93


-----

related to the integration process, and does not consider potential impacts of current market conditions on the
results of operations.

As a result of the factors described above, investors should not place undue reliance on the Unaudited Pro
Forma Financial Information and the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Other Information. In particular, the
Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information and the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Other Information may
not reflect what the Combined Group’s financial position and results of operations would have been had the
Assemblin Financing Acquisition and the Caverion Combination already been effective during the relevant
periods and may not be indicative of the financial position and results of operations that the Combined Group
will achieve in the future.

###### The Combined Group Data included in the offering memorandum is subject to significant limitations and may differ significantly from the actual performance of the Combined Group.

We have prepared financial information of the Combined Group to illustrate the effect of the Caverion
Combination on our results of operations, certain operating data and non-IFRS financial information. The
Combined Group Data is not prepared pursuant to IFRS since it is an aggregation of consolidated financial
information from different groups (the Assemblin Financing Group, the Assemblin Group and the Caverion
Group, which were not under common control during the periods aggregated) and, consequently, the aggregated
amounts may not represent, and are not intended to represent, the results that would have been achieved if the
companies were under common control during relevant periods. The Combined Group Data included herein
has not been audited, reviewed or verified by any independent auditors and does not adjust for differences in
how line items are calculated or accounted for by the Assemblin Financing Group or the Assemblin Group
compared to the Caverion Group. The Combined Group Data presents certain financial and operational
information by segments which do not yet exist for the Group in order to illustrate how results may be broken
down on a Combined Group basis. The Assemblin Group currently reports its financial and operational results
broken down by the following business areas: Assemblin Electrical, Assemblin H&S, Assemblin Ventilation,
Assemblin Finland and Assemblin Norway. The Caverion Group reports its financial and operational results
broken down by the following divisions: Sweden, Finland, Germany, Norway, Industry, Austria, Denmark and
Other countries (comprised of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania).

In addition, the Combined Group Data does not reflect the cost of any integration activities, the expected
synergies from the Caverion Combination or any intra-group eliminations. The Combined Group Data assumes
that the Caverion Combination occurred on April 1, 2023 for purposes of the results of operations, certain
operating data and non-IFRS financial information presented for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. Due
to its nature, the Combined Group Data describes only a hypothetical situation and neither reflects the actual
results of operations, certain operating data and non-IFRS financial information of the Combined Group after
completion of the Caverion Combination, nor does it indicate the future development of the results of
operations, certain operating data and non-IFRS financial information of the Combined Group.

Furthermore, the Combined Group Data does not reflect future exceptional charges resulting from the Caverion
Combination or future events that may occur, including restructuring activities or other costs related to the
integration process, and does not consider potential impacts of current market conditions on the results of
operations.

As a result of the factors described above, investors should not place undue reliance on the Combined Group
Data. In particular, the Combined Group Data may not reflect what the Combined Group’s results of operations,
certain operating data and non-IFRS financial information would have been had the Caverion Combination
already been effective during the relevant periods and may not be indicative of the financial position and results
of operations that the Combined Group will achieve in the future.

###### Certain operational data that is presented on a combined basis have historically been calculated differently by Assemblin and Caverion

In this offering memorandum, we present Combined Group Order intake and Combined Group Order backlog,
which has been calculated by simply aggregating the relevant figures for Assemblin and Caverion. Assemblin
and Caverion have historically employed different methodologies in the calculation of Order intake and Order
backlog, in part due to their differing business mixes. These differences in calculation may affect the
comparability and consistency of the aggregated data and, as a result, these figures may not accurately reflect
the Combined Group's Order intake or Order backlog, or the financial health or operational efficiency of the
Combined Group.

Investors are advised to consider the relevant definitions of Assemblin Order intake, Assemblin Order backlog,
Caverion Order intake and Caverion Order backlog, and the impact of these different calculation methods on
the aggregated figures.

###### Ownership of 100% of Caverion’s shares is dependent on the completion of the Caverion Squeeze Out.

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, Crayfish BidCo owns 94.39% of Caverion’s shares (excluding
treasury shares). Crayfish BidCo has filed an application to initiate the squeeze-out proceedings as provided in
the Finnish Companies Act in order to gain 100% of Caverion’s shares. Until such time as the Caverion Squeeze
Out has completed or Crayfish BidCo has obtained advance title to the remaining minority Caverion shares
against the placing of a security under the squeeze-out proceedings, third-party minority shareholders will
continue to hold the outstanding Caverion shares. The Caverion Squeeze Out is an arbitral proceeding regulated
by the Finnish Companies Act and the Finnish Arbitration Act (967/1992, as amended, FI: _Laki_
_välimiesmenettelystä), which could potentially be time consuming, and is subject to appeal by one or more_
minority shareholders. These proceedings typically take approximately eight to twelve months to complete but
advance title to the minority shares may, subject to the discretion of the arbitral tribunal, under the proceedings
often be obtained in approximately four to six months against the placing of a security. These proceedings may
also be longer due to events outside Crayfish BidCo’s control. Further, in the event that the placing of security
by Crayfish BidCo for obtaining advance title is refused by the arbitral tribunal, Crayfish BidCo could decide
not to place such security or appeal the arbitral award and, if Crayfish BidCo decides not to pay the redemption
price in accordance with such award, the minority shareholders would potentially continue to hold some or all
of the outstanding Caverion shares until Crayfish BidCo’s redemption right and the redemption price have been
finally determined by a non-appealable arbitral award or court decision and such redemption price has been
paid by Crayfish BidCo.

###### Risks Related to Our Structure

 The Note Guarantees and security interests on the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability 

The Indenture will provide that certain Note Guarantees will be limited to the maximum amount that can be
guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor without rendering the relevant Note Guarantee voidable or otherwise
ineffective under applicable law and enforcement of each Note Guarantee would be subject to certain generally
available defenses. These laws and defenses include those that relate to corporate benefit, fraudulent transfer or
conveyance, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws,
regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. Additionally, in accordance with local laws,
the Security Agent and/or the Trustee may not be able to represent the holders of the Notes in a court process

95


-----

without a specific power of attorney. See “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance and other laws, a
court could subordinate or void the Note Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral granted by the
relevant Security Documents and, if payment had already been made under a Note Guarantee or upon
enforcement of the Collateral, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant Guarantor, if the court
found that:

- the relevant Note Guarantee or security interest under the Security Documents was incurred with actual
intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or security provider or, in
certain jurisdictions, even when the recipient was simply aware that the Guarantor or security provider
was insolvent when it granted the relevant Note Guarantee or security;

- the Guarantor or security provider did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for
the relevant Note Guarantee or security interest under a Security Document and the Guarantor or security
provider was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Note Guarantee or security
interest; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Note Guarantee or
security interest; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability
to pay at maturity;

- the relevant Note Guarantees or Security Documents were held to exceed the corporate objective of the
Guarantor or security provider or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the
Guarantor or security provider; or

- the amount paid or payable under the relevant Note Guarantee or the enforcement proceeds under the
relevant Security Documents was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law.

- The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon applicable
governing law. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness:

- the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, is greater than the fair value of all its assets;

- the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay the probable liability
on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become due; or

- it cannot pay its debts as they become due.

If a court were to find that the issuance of the Notes or a Note Guarantee was a fraudulent conveyance or held
it unenforceable for any other reason, the court could hold that the payment obligations under the Notes or such
Guarantee are ineffective, or require the holders of the Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the
Notes or such Note Guarantee. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent conveyance occurred, you may cease
to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if
applicable, of the other Guarantors under any Note Guarantees that have not been declared void.

Additionally, any future pledge of Collateral in favor of the Security Agent, including pursuant to Security
Documents delivered after the date of the Indenture, might be avoidable by the security provider (as debtor-inpossession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy (or similar officer) if certain events or circumstances exist or occur,
including, among others, if the security provider is insolvent at the time of the pledge, the pledge permits the
holders of the Notes to receive a greater recovery than if the pledge had not been given and a bankruptcy
proceeding in respect of the security provider is commenced within three months following the pledge, or in
certain circumstances, a longer period.

96


-----

In order to receive the benefit of a security interest, the secured creditors must hold secured claims (i.e., the
secured party and the creditor have to be the same person).

In addition, under the terms of the Indenture, we will be permitted in the future to incur additional indebtedness
and other obligations that may share in the liens on the Collateral securing the Notes and the liens on the
collateral securing our other secured debt. The granting of new security interests may require the releasing and
retaking of security or otherwise create new hardening periods in certain jurisdictions. The applicable hardening
period for these new security interests will run from the moment each new security interest has been granted or
perfected. At each time, if the security interest granted or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the
respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective and it may
not be possible to enforce it.

###### The insolvency laws of Sweden, Norway and Finland may not be as favorable to you as U.S. bankruptcy laws and may preclude holders of the Notes from recovering payments due on the Notes

The Issuer is established under the laws of Sweden, and certain of the Guarantors are established under the laws
of Sweden, Norway and Finland. Consequently, in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency of the Issuer or any
of the Guarantors, insolvency proceedings with respect to the Issuer or the Guarantors would most likely be
based on and governed by the insolvency laws of the jurisdiction under which the relevant entity is established.
The insolvency laws of Sweden, Norway and Finland may be less favorable to your interests as creditors than
the bankruptcy laws of the United States or another jurisdiction with which you may be familiar, particularly
with respect to the priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the
insolvency proceedings. The application of these laws, and any conflict between them, may limit your ability
to recover payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency
laws. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests.”

###### Enforcing your rights as a holder of Notes or under the Note Guarantees or security across multiple jurisdictions may prove difficult

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Sweden and the Guarantors are incorporated or organized under
the laws of Sweden, Norway and Finland. The Collateral includes the shares of certain of our subsidiaries
incorporated under the laws of these jurisdictions. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event,
proceedings could be initiated in Sweden, Norway and Finland. Such multijurisdictional proceedings are likely
to be complex and costly for creditors and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the
enforcement of your rights. Your rights under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject
to the insolvency and administrative laws of several jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that you will
be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
proceedings. The multijurisdictional nature of enforcement over the Collateral may limit the realizable value of
the Collateral.

Moreover, in certain jurisdictions, it is unclear whether all security interests in the Collateral give the Security
Agent a right to prevent other creditors from foreclosing on and realizing the Collateral or whether certain
security interests only give the Security Agent priority in the distribution of any proceeds of such realization.
Accordingly, the Security Agent and holders of the Notes may not be able to avoid foreclosure by other creditors
(including unsecured creditors) on the Collateral.

###### You may be unable to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities laws violations

The Issuer is organized under the laws of Sweden and the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Sweden,
Norway and Finland. Neither the Issuer nor the Guarantors have any material assets in the United States. Some
or all of the directors and executive officers of the Issuer may be non-residents of the United States and many
of their assets will be located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect
service of process within the United States upon the Issuer or its directors and executive officers, or to enforce

97


-----

any judgments obtained in U.S. courts predicated upon civil liability provisions of U.S. securities laws. In
addition, the Issuer cannot assure investors that civil liabilities predicated upon federal securities laws of the
United States will be enforceable in Sweden. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note
_Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

###### Risks Related to Our Financial Profile

 Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations may make it difficult for us to fulfil our obligations under the Notes and operate our business

We have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness with significant debt service requirements. On a pro
forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, the Issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries’ total financial
indebtedness (including the Notes) would have been SEK 17,563 million (approximately €1,524 million) as of
March 31, 2024.

Our significant leverage could have important consequences for holders of the Notes, including, but not limited
to:

- making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our other debt and
liabilities;

- requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our debt instead of
operations, thus reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund internal growth through working
capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures, product research and development, and other
general corporate purposes;

- increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, a downturn in our business, or
generally adverse economic or industry conditions;

- placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged
as us;

- limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive
environment and industry;

- restricting us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or exploiting certain business opportunities;

- limiting, among other things, our and our subsidiaries’ ability to borrow additional funds, including with
respect to financial leases on which we rely for replacement and expansion of our vehicle fleet, or raise
equity capital in the future and increasing the costs of such additional financings;

- exposing us to risks that are inherent in interest rate fluctuations because certain of our indebtedness
(including the Existing Notes and the Floating Rate Notes) bears variable rates of interest; and

- subjecting us to restrictive covenants, including, in the case of our Super Senior Facilities, financial
covenants, the non-compliance with which could result in an event of default under, or acceleration of,
our indebtedness.

We primarily expect to use cash flow from operations and borrowings under our Super Senior Facilities to
finance our operations, service our indebtedness and fund capital expenditures. Our ability to make these
payments depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic,
regulatory and other factors, many of which we cannot control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash
flow from operations in the future, which could result in us being unable to service or repay indebtedness or
fund other liquidity needs. If we cannot service our indebtedness and meet our other obligations and

98


-----

commitments, we might be required to refinance our debt or dispose of assets to obtain funds for such purpose.
We cannot assure you that such refinancings or asset disposals could be effected on a timely basis or on
satisfactory terms, if at all, or would be permitted by the terms of our debt instruments.

###### Despite our high level of indebtedness and restrictive covenants, we and our subsidiaries will still be able to incur significant additional amounts of debt or make certain restricted payments, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage

We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including additional secured
indebtedness, in the future. Although the Existing Notes Indenture, the Indenture and the Super Senior Facilities
Agreements will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a
number of significant qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances, the amount of
indebtedness (including secured indebtedness) that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could
be substantial. Following this Offering, we expect to have commitments of SEK 1,470 million and EUR 125
million under our Revolving Credit Facility, and SEK 300 million and EUR 150 million under our Guarantee
Facility, which may be increased in accordance with the terms described in “Description of the Notes” and
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—The Super Senior Facilities”. See “—The Collateral may
_not be sufficient to secure the obligations under the Notes.” Under the Existing Notes Indenture and the_
Indenture, in addition to specified permitted debt, we will be able to incur additional indebtedness so long as,
on a pro forma basis, our fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Existing Notes Indenture and the
Indenture) is at least 2.0 to 1.0 and such indebtedness may be secured by a first-priority lien on the Collateral
securing the Notes so long as on a pro forma basis our consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio (as
calculated in accordance with the “Description of the Notes”) is no greater than 4.5 to 1.0. In addition, neither
the Existing Notes Indenture and the Indenture nor the agreement governing our Super Senior Facilities will
prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements. Moreover,
the Existing Notes Indenture and the Indenture will permit us to incur additional debt that is pari passu with
the Notes and, in certain circumstances, receive proceeds from enforcement of Collateral prior to the Notes.
See “—Risks Related to the Notes and the Collateral Risks Related to the Notes and the Collateral Creditors
_under the Super Senior Facilities, any credit facility that refinances or replaces the Super Senior Facilities,_
_certain hedging obligations and certain other indebtedness and obligations permitted to be incurred on a_
_priority basis under the Indenture are entitled to be repaid in priority to the Notes.” In addition, some of the_
debt we may incur in the future could be effectively and structurally senior to the Notes and may be secured by
collateral that does not secure the Notes. The incurrence of additional debt would increase the leverage-related
risks described in this offering memorandum. If we are able to designate some of our restricted subsidiaries
under the Existing Notes Indenture and the Indenture as unrestricted subsidiaries, those unrestricted subsidiaries
would be permitted to borrow beyond the limitations specified in the Existing Notes Indenture and the Indenture
and engage in other activities in which restricted subsidiaries may not engage. We are also permitted to invest
in joint ventures and acquisitions, which may increase our indebtedness. Moreover, although the Existing Notes
Indenture, the Indenture and the agreements governing our Super Senior Facilities will contain restrictions on
our ability to make restricted payments, including the declaration and payment of dividends, we will be able to
make substantial restricted payments under certain circumstances. Under the Existing Notes Indenture and
Indenture, for example, we will be able to make dividends, distributions, loans or other payments to any Parent
(as defined therein) so long as on a pro forma basis our specified consolidated total net leverage ratio (as
calculated in accordance with the “Description of the Notes”) does not exceed 3.25 to 1.0 on a net basis (or 3.5
to 1.0 with respect to certain investments). Adding new debt to our and our subsidiaries’ existing debt levels or
making restricted payments could exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage described above,
including our possible inability to service our debt.

99


-----

###### We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, including due to factors outside our control, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful

Our ability to service our indebtedness will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by
prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors. Some of these factors are
beyond our control. In addition, our ability to borrow funds in the future to make payments on our debt will
depend on the satisfaction of the covenants in our debt agreements, including the Existing Notes Indenture, the
Indenture and other agreements we may enter into in the future. We cannot assure you that our business will
generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount
sufficient to enable us to make interest and principal payments on our debt, including the Notes, or to fund our
other liquidity needs.

If our cash flows from operations and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt obligations, we may be
forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital, forego opportunities, or seek
to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes. These alternative measures may not be
successful and may not be sufficient to enable us to meet our scheduled debt obligations. In the absence of such
cash flows and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be required to sell material
assets to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those asset
sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices and on terms that we believe are fair, and any proceeds that we
receive may not be adequate to meet any debt obligations then due. If we cannot meet our debt obligations, the
holders of our debt may accelerate our debt and, to the extent such debt is secured, foreclose on our assets
securing such debt. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay all of our debt.

In addition, any failure to make payments of interest or principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely
basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional
indebtedness. For a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Assemblin—Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital_
_Resources.”_

###### We are subject to restrictive debt covenants limit our flexibility in operating our business and our ability to raise additional funds

The Existing Notes Indenture, the Indenture and the agreements governing our Super Senior Facilities will
contain covenants that significantly restrict our ability to:

- incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;

- incur or permit to exist certain liens;

- make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions, with respect to Capital Stock;

- prepay or redeem subordinated debt or Capital Stock;

- make certain loans or other investments;

- create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or advances
to, and on the transfer of assets to the Issuer or any of its restricted subsidiaries;

- sell, lease or transfer certain assets, including Capital Stock of restricted subsidiaries;

- engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

- issue or sell the share capital of certain subsidiaries;

100


-----

- consummate a change of control;

- consolidate or merge with other entities or sell substantially all of our assets; and

- impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes.

Each of the covenants is subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Super Senior Facilities”,_ “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—the Existing Notes and the Existing Notes Indenture” and “Description of the Senior Secured_
_Notes—Certain Covenants.” Despite these exceptions and qualifications, the covenants that are contained in_
the Existing Notes Indenture, and that will be contained in the Indenture and the agreements governing our
Super Senior Facilities, could materially affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to
react to market conditions, raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or
business downturns, take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise or grow in accordance with
our strategy. For example, such restrictions could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, make
strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances, restructure our organization or finance our capital needs.

Additionally, our Super Senior Facilities Agreements will require us to maintain a senior secured net leverage
ratio and our ability to meet that financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control, including
prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. A breach of any of those covenants or restrictions could
result in an event of default under the agreements governing the Super Senior Facilities, and the relevant lenders,
subject to applicable cure periods and other limitations on acceleration or enforcement, could cancel the
availability of the Super Senior Facilities and elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder, together with
accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, a default under the agreements governing the Super
Senior Facilities could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain
cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, including the Existing Notes Indenture and the Indenture. If our
creditors, including the lenders under the Super Senior Facilities, accelerate the payment of those amounts, we
cannot assure you that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those
amounts, and to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries which would be due and payable and to make
payments to enable us to repay the Notes, in full or in part. In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts,
our creditors could proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts.

###### The Existing Notes and drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear, and the Floating Rate Notes will bear, interest at floating rates that could rise significantly, increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow

The Existing Notes bear, and the Floating Rate Notes will bear, interest at floating rates of interest per annum
equal to EURIBOR and drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at floating rates of interest
per annum equal to STIBOR in relation to cash advances in Swedish krona (or, in relation to cash advances in
euro, EURIBOR, in relation to cash advances in Norwegian kroner, NIBOR, and, in relation to cash advances
in Danish krona, CIBOR, as adjusted periodically, plus a spread. In addition, the Existing Notes Indenture
permits us and the Indenture will permit us to incur additional indebtedness, which may bear a floating rate of
interest. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future. To the extent that interest rates or any drawings
were to increase significantly our interest expense would correspondingly increase, reducing our cash flow.
Although we may enter into certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be
no assurance that hedging will be available or continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms.
Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to
terminate any hedging arrangements. Further, there may be a mismatch between the successor rates applied in
respect of the Group’s floating rate debt and the successor rates applied in respect of hedging arrangements
thereon, which may render such hedging arrangements ineffective in managing the Group’s interest rate risks.

###### Uncertainty relating to the calculation of EURIBOR or a discontinuance of similar rates or any regulatory reform affecting EURIBOR or similar rates may materially adversely affect the value of and return on our floating rate debt, including the Floating Rate Notes

EURIBOR, other interest rates, equity, foreign exchange rates and other types of rates and indices that are
deemed to be “benchmarks” are the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory discussions and
proposals for reform. Some of these reforms are already effective whilst others are still to be implemented.

Regulation (EU) No. 2016/1011 (the “Benchmarks Regulation”) and Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 as it forms
part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK Benchmarks Regulation”) apply to the provision
of benchmarks, the contribution of input data to a benchmark and the use of benchmarks within the European
Union or the UK (as applicable). The Benchmarks Regulation and the UK Benchmarks Regulation could have
a material impact on the Notes offered hereby linked to EURIBOR or another benchmark rate of index, in
particular if the methodology or other terms of the benchmark are changed in order to comply with either of
their terms, and such changes could (amongst other things) have the effect of reducing or increasing the rate or
level, or affecting the volatility of the published rate or level, of the benchmark. More broadly, any of the
international, national or other proposals for reform, or the general increased regulatory scrutiny of benchmarks,
could increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of a benchmark and
complying with any such regulations or requirements. Such factors may have the effect of discouraging market
participants from continuing to administer or contribute to certain “benchmarks,” trigger changes in the rules
or methodologies used in certain “benchmarks” or lead to the discontinuance or unavailability of quotes of
certain “benchmarks.”

As an example of such benchmark reforms, on March 5, 2021, the FCA confirmed that all LIBOR settings will
either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative: (i) immediately after December
31, 2021, in the case of all sterling, euro, Swiss franc and Japanese yen settings, and the 1-week and 2-month
U.S. dollar settings; and (ii) immediately after June 30, 2023, in the case of the remaining U.S. dollar settings.
In addition, on November 29, 2017, the Bank of England and the FCA announced that, from January 2018, its
working group on Sterling risk free rates has been mandated with implementing a broad based transition to the
90 Sterling Overnight Index Average (“SONIA”) over the next four years across sterling bond, loan and
derivative markets so that SONIA is established as the primary sterling interest rate benchmark by the end of
2021.

On September 21, 2017, the European Central Bank announced that it would be part of a new working group
tasked with the identification and adoption of a “risk free overnight rate” which can serve as a basis for an
alternative to current benchmarks used in a variety of financial instruments and contracts in the euro area. On
September 13, 2018, the working group on Euro risk-free rates recommended the new Euro short-term rate
(“€STR”) as the new risk-free rate for the euro area. The €STR was published for the first time on October 2,
2019. Although EURIBOR has been reformed in order to comply with the terms of the Benchmark Regulation,
it remains uncertain as to how long it will continue in its current form, or whether it will be further reformed or
replaced with €STR or an alternative benchmark.

Any elimination of the EURIBOR benchmark, or changes in the manner of administration of EURIBOR, or
actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions of
our floating rate debt (including but not limited to the Super Senior Facilities, the Existing Notes and the
Floating Rate Notes whose interest rates are linked to EURIBOR). Any such consequence could have a material
adverse effect on the value of and return on any such floating rate debt. If EURIBOR were discontinued or
otherwise unavailable, the rate of interest on our floating rate debt will be determined for the relevant period by
the fallback provisions applicable to such debt. Additionally, manipulative practices with respect EURIBOR
may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR which could have an adverse impact on
our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest.

102

The Existing Indenture provides and the Indenture will provide a mechanism whereby, if EURIBOR is no longer
being calculated or administered, the Issuer could cause an independent financial advisor to determine an
appropriate successor rate, and make certain adjustments to such rate, including applying a spread thereon to
make such successor rate substantially comparable to EURIBOR, which upon certification by the Issuer to each
of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and the Paying Agent will be used to calculate the interest rate in relation
to the Existing Notes and the Notes without any further action or consent by the Holders or the Trustee. This
would mean that interest on the Existing Notes and the Notes would be determined on the basis of a benchmark
rate, together with adjustments, that was not contemplated at the time you purchased the Notes issued on the
Issue Date. In addition, due to the uncertainty concerning the availability of an appropriate successor rate and
the involvement of an independent financial advisor, the Existing Indenture and the Indenture’s successor rate
mechanism may not operate as intended at the relevant time.

###### Risks Related to the Notes and the Collateral

 Creditors under the Super Senior Facilities, any credit facility that refinances or replaces the Super Senior Facilities, certain hedging obligations and certain other indebtedness and obligations (including any future guarantee facilities) permitted to be incurred on a priority basis under the Indenture are entitled to be repaid in priority to the Notes

Following the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed by the same entities that also guarantee the Super Senior
Facilities and the Existing Notes Indenture. Furthermore, the Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be secured
initially on a first-priority basis by the same Collateral securing the obligations under the Existing Notes and
the Super Senior Facilities. In addition, under the terms of the Indenture, we will be permitted to incur
significant additional indebtedness and other obligations that may be secured by the same Collateral on a pari
passu basis with the Notes and, in certain circumstances, receive proceeds from enforcement of Collateral prior
to the Notes. The Indenture will permit and the Intercreditor Agreement permits hedging and certain other
indebtedness and obligations (including any future guarantee facilities) incurred in accordance with the
Indenture to be secured on a priority basis in respect of proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral.

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the first priority security interests securing the Notes are contractually
deemed to rank equally with the security interests that secure (but only to the extent that such security is
expressed to secure those liabilities) (i) the Existing Notes, (ii) obligations under the Super Senior Facilities,
including obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Guarantee Facility and the Pension Guarantee
Facility, (iii) certain obligations under hedging arrangements and (iv) certain other future indebtedness and
obligations (including any future guarantee facilities) permitted to be incurred under the Indenture. Such
security interests are, or will be, evidenced by security documents for the benefit of (whether directly or through
the Security Agent) the holders of the Notes, the holders of the Existing Notes, the lenders under the Super
Senior Facilities and/or the holders of certain other future indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the
Indenture. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, subject to certain conditions, in the event of
acceleration of the Super Senior Facilities, the Existing Notes or the Notes or other secured obligations, amounts
recovered in respect of the Collateral, will be required to repay indebtedness in respect of the Super Senior
Facilities, including obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Guarantee Facility and the Pension
Guarantee Facility, as well as certain Hedging Obligations, certain future indebtedness and obligations
(including any future guarantee facilities) and hedging obligations (if any) in priority to the Notes, following
the payment of fees and expenses of the agent under the Super Senior Facilities, the Trustee and the Security
Agent (and any receiver or delegate) and any fees and expenses of any other creditor representative of future
indebtedness permitted under the terms of the Indenture to benefit from such security interests. As a result,
proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may be insufficient to pay claims under the Notes. In addition,

103


-----

claims of our secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also secure the Notes will have priority
with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Notes.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that a common security agent, who will serve as the Security Agent for
the secured parties with respect to the Collateral, will act only as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement.
The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Collateral unless otherwise instructed by the Instructing
Group (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) for the purpose of enforcement. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—Security.”_

Creditors under Super Senior Facilities or under other indebtedness or obligations that are secured on a priority
basis with respect to proceeds from the enforcement of Collateral may have interests that are different from the
interests of holders of the Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to
pursue their remedies under the security documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders
of the Notes to do so.

In addition, if the Security Agent sells the Collateral as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees and the liens over any other assets
of such entities securing such Notes and Notes Guarantees may be released. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—Security.”_

###### Holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral

To the extent permitted under applicable law, and subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Notes will be
secured on a first-ranking basis by substantially the same rights, property and assets securing the obligations
under the Existing Notes, the Super Senior Facilities, including obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility,
the Guarantee Facility and the Pension Guarantee Facility. In addition, under the terms of the Indenture, we will
be permitted to incur significant additional indebtedness and other obligations that may be secured by the same
Collateral.

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, a common security agent will serve as the Security Agent for the
secured parties under the Super Senior Facilities, the Existing Notes, the Notes and the hedging arrangements
(if any), respectively, with regard to the shared Collateral (as applicable). The Intercreditor Agreement will
provide that the Security Agent will, subject to certain limited exceptions, act to enforce the security interests
in the Collateral and take instructions from the relevant secured creditors in respect of the Collateral only at the
direction of an “instructing group.”

Generally, if there are conflicting enforcement instructions received by the Security Agent from the different
classes of creditors which are secured by the Collateral and who can constitute either “majority super super
senior creditors” (generally lenders under the Pension Guarantee Facility and any additional Pension Guarantee
Facility whose credit participations represent more than 66[2]/3 per cent. of the aggregate credit participations of
all Pension Guarantee Facility lenders), “majority super senior creditors” (generally, creditors representing more
than 50 per cent. of the aggregate of all unpaid and undrawn commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility
and the Guarantee Facility (or any replacement thereof) and the termination value or assumed termination value
of certain future “super priority” hedging obligations, if any) or “majority senior secured creditors” (generally,
creditors representing the majority of the outstanding principal amount under the Existing Notes, the Notes, any
pari passu secured indebtedness and the termination value or assumed termination value of certain future
hedging obligations which are not given “super priority” status, if any), as the case may be, the representatives
of the creditors sharing in the Collateral are required to first consult in good faith with each other (in each case,
including the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Existing Notes and the Notes, the agent on behalf of lenders
under the Pension Guarantee Facility (or any replacement thereof) and the agent on behalf of the lenders under
the Revolving Credit Facility (or any replacement thereof) and the Security Agent, for a period of 15 days (or
such shorter period as may be agreed) with a view to coordinating the instructions to be given by an instructing

104


-----

group and agreeing an enforcement strategy (a “joint enforcement strategy”). Upon conclusion of this
“consultation period”, if the relevant creditor representatives are unable to agree on a joint enforcement strategy
or if conflicting enforcement instructions are received by the Security Agent from the different classes of
creditors which are secured by the Collateral and who can constitute an instructing group, and provided that the
“security enforcement principles” set out in the Intercreditor Agreement have been complied with, then the
majority senior secured creditors shall constitute an instructing group and shall have the right to instruct the
Security Agent as to the enforcement of the Collateral.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no consultation period shall be required if either (i) any of the Collateral
becomes enforceable because of an insolvency event in respect of the Issuer or certain members of the Group,
(ii) the majority super super senior creditors, majority super senior creditors or the majority senior secured
creditors determine in good faith that entering into consultation could reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any of the Collateral or to reduce the amount likely to
be realized upon enforcement of the Collateral to a level such that the obligations to the “super senior creditors”
would not be discharged in full, or (iii) the relevant creditor representatives are in agreement as to any proposed
enforcement action, in which case, the Security Agent shall act in accordance with the instructions provided by
the majority senior secured creditors (provided that such instructions are consistent with the security
enforcement principles set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement).

Generally, if the Security Agent is obliged to follow the enforcement instructions of the majority senior secured
creditors as discussed above and either (i) the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility (or any replacement
thereof) (together with any “super priority” hedging obligations) have not been repaid in full within six months
of the end of the consultation period, (ii) the Security Agent has not commenced any enforcement action (or
any transaction in lieu) in respect of the relevant Collateral within three months of the end of the consultation
period or (iii) an insolvency event has occurred in respect of the Issuer or certain members of the Group and
the Security Agent has not commenced enforcement (or any transaction in lieu) of the relevant Collateral or
taken any other enforcement action at that time, then, the Security Agent shall, provided that the security
enforcement principles set out in the Intercreditor Agreement have been complied with, instead follow the
instructions that are given by the majority super senior creditors (and the terms of the relevant previous
enforcement instructions of the majority senior secured creditors which conflict with the instructions of the
majority super senior creditors shall be deemed revoked).

Further, generally, if the Security Agent is obliged to follow the enforcement instructions of the majority super
senior creditors or the majority senior secured creditors as discussed above and either (i) the lenders under the
Pension Guarantee Facility (or any replacement thereof) have not been repaid in full within twelve months of
the end of the consultation period, (ii) the Security Agent has not commenced any enforcement action (or any
transaction in lieu) in respect of the relevant Collateral within nine months of the end of the consultation period
or (iii) an insolvency event has occurred in respect of the Issuer or certain members of the Group and the
Security Agent has not commenced enforcement (or any transaction in lieu) of the relevant Collateral or taken
any other enforcement action at that time, then, the Security Agent shall, provided that the security enforcement
principles set out in the Intercreditor Agreement have been complied with, instead follow the instructions that
are given by the majority super super senior creditors (and the terms of the relevant previous enforcement
instructions of the majority senior secured creditors or majority super senior secured creditors which conflict
with the instructions of the majority super senior creditors shall be deemed revoked).

The foregoing security enforcement arrangements could be disadvantageous to the holders of the Notes in a
number of respects.

Disputes may occur between the holders of the Notes and holders of the Existing Notes or creditors under our
Super Senior Facilities (under any of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Guarantee Facility and the Pension
Guarantee Facility), counterparties to certain hedging arrangements, if any, and/or holders of any permitted pari

105


-----

passu secured indebtedness as to the appropriate manner of pursuing enforcement remedies and strategies with
respect to the Collateral securing such obligations. In such an event, the holders of the Notes will be bound by
any decisions of the relevant instructing group, which may result in enforcement action in respect of the relevant
Collateral, whether or not such action is approved by the holders of the Notes or may be adverse to such holders
of Notes. The creditors under the Super Senior Facilities (under any of the Revolving Credit Facility, the
Guarantee Facility and the Pension Guarantee Facility), counterparties to certain hedging arrangements, if any,
or the holders of any permitted pari passu secured indebtedness may have interests that are different from the
interest of holders of the Notes and they may elect to pursue their remedies under the relevant Security
Documents at a time when it would otherwise be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so.

Other creditors not party to the Intercreditor Agreement could commence enforcement action against the Issuer
or one or more of the Issuer’s subsidiaries during the consultation period or the Issuer or one or more of the
Issuer’s subsidiaries could seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws, or the value of certain Collateral
could otherwise be impaired or reduced in value. In addition, if we incur substantial additional indebtedness
which may be secured on the Collateral, the holders of the Notes may not comprise the requisite majority senior
secured creditors for the purposes of instructing the Security Agent. Further, if the super senior creditors have
not been repaid in full within six months of the end of the consultation period or in the event of the occurrence
of certain other circumstances described above, then control of the enforcement proceedings will shift to the
majority super senior creditors and if the super super senior creditors have not been repaid in full within twelve
months of the end of the consultation period or in the event of the occurrence of certain other circumstances
described above, then control of the enforcement proceedings will shift to the majority super super senior
creditors.

The holders of the Notes will also have no separate right to enforce the Collateral securing the Notes. In addition,
the holders of the Notes will not be able to instruct the Security Agent, force a sale of Collateral or otherwise
independently pursue the remedies of a secured creditor under the relevant Security Documents, unless they
comprise an instructing group which is entitled to give such instructions, which, in turn, will depend on certain
conditions and circumstances including those described above.

In addition, if the Security Agent sells any of the Collateral as a result of an enforcement action in accordance
with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Notes and over any other assets securing the Notes may be
released. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description
_of the Notes—Security—Release of Liens.”_

###### The Collateral may not be sufficient to secure the obligations under the Notes

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be secured by first-priority security interests in the Collateral described
in this offering memorandum, which Collateral also secures the obligations under the Super Senior Facilities,
the Existing Notes, certain hedging obligations and may secure certain future obligations. The Revolving Credit
Facility is part of the Super Senior Facilities which also include an initial SEK 300 million Guarantee Facility
(to be increased by EUR 150 million on the Issue Date) and an initial SEK 375 million Pension Guarantee
Facility which was increased to SEK 410m. We may increase the amounts available under Super Senior
Facilities or incur additional super senior liabilities (including under any future guarantee facilities) as a result
of which the amount of indebtedness and obligations that will benefit from “super priority” first-priority security
interests in the Collateral may be increased up to the amount permitted under the Indenture. The Indenture will
not prohibit any increases to the amount of the Pension Guarantee Facility or the Guarantee Facility and will
not prohibit entry into any future guarantee facilities secured on the Collateral nor will it provide any cap in
respect of such amounts. Thus the amount of any obligations under the Pension Guarantee Facility or the
Guarantee Facility (or other facilities utilized for the same purposes) will be secured in priority to the Notes.
The Collateral may also secure additional debt ranking pari passu with the Notes to the extent permitted by the
terms of the Existing Notes Indenture, the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The rights of the holders

106


-----

of the Notes to the Collateral may therefore be diluted by any increase in the debt secured by first-priority liens
on the Collateral.

If there is an event of default on the Notes, the holders of the Notes will be secured only by the Collateral. There
is no guarantee that the value of the Collateral will be sufficient to enable the Issuer to satisfy its obligations
under each series of the Notes. The proceeds of any sale of the Collateral following an event of default with
respect to the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy, and may be substantially less than, amounts due on the
Notes.

The value of the Collateral is based on certain assumptions. The fair market value of the Collateral at any point
in time may be subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, general economic conditions,
industry conditions and similar factors. The amount to be received upon an enforcement of such Collateral will
depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, the
condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers, whether or not our
business is sold as a going concern, the ability to readily liquidate the Collateral and the fair market value and
condition of the Collateral. Furthermore, there may not be any buyer willing and able to purchase our business
as a going concern, or willing to buy a significant portion of our assets in the event of an enforcement action.
As a result, the book value of the Collateral should not be conclusively relied on as a measure of realizable
value for such assets following the occurrence of an event of default or enforcement event under the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Existing Notes Indenture, the Indenture or the Super Senior Facilities. All or a
portion of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, we
cannot assure you that there will be a market for the sale of the Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there
will not be a substantial delay in our liquidation. In addition, the security granted over the shares of an entity
may be of no value if that entity is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding.

To the extent that liens, security interests and other rights granted to other parties encumber assets owned by
the Issuer or the Guarantors, those parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property
subject to their liens, security interests or other rights that could adversely affect the value of that Collateral and
the ability of the Security Agent, the Trustee or investors as holders of the Notes to realize or enforce that
Collateral. If the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes and
the Notes Guarantees, investors (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would
have only an unsecured claim (if the relevant guarantee has not been released) against the Issuer’s and the
Guarantors’ remaining assets. Each of these factors or any challenge to the validity of the Collateral or the
intercreditor arrangement governing our creditors’ rights could reduce the proceeds realized upon enforcement
of the Collateral.

In addition, the Collateral may not be liquid, and its value to other parties may be less than its value to us.
Likewise, we cannot assure you that there will be a market for the pledged shares or other Collateral or, if such
market does exist, that there will not be substantial delays in their liquidation. In addition, the value of this
Collateral may fluctuate over time.

###### The Collateral secures amounts under certain guarantee facilities and future guarantee facilities which are more likely to become due in circumstances when an enforcement action may be taken

The Super Senior Facilities comprise the Revolving Credit Facility, the Guarantee Facility and the Pension
Guarantee Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized by the drawing of cash advances, the issue
of bank guarantees and documentary credits (including letters of credit and performance bonds) and by way of
ancillary facilities. The Guarantee Facility may be utilized by the issue of letters of credits, bank guarantees and
by way of ancillary facilities by way of guarantee facilities and the Pension Guarantee Facility may be utilized
by the issue of bank guarantees and by way of ancillary facilities by way of pension guarantee facilities. The

107


-----

Pension Guarantee Facility is intended to provide a guarantee required by the Swedish pension regulatory
authorities in respect of the Group’s defined benefit pensions obligations.

In the ordinary course of business, amounts under the Guarantee Facility (including under any future guarantee
facilities) and the Pension Guarantee Facility are likely to operate in a contingent manner rather than requiring
immediate repayment. However, in the types of circumstances where the Collateral may become enforceable,
including upon a payment default or insolvency related default under the Notes, the Existing Notes, the
Revolving Credit Facility, the Guarantee Facility (including under any future guarantee facilities) or the Pension
Guarantee Facility, these contingent claims are more likely to crystallize. This may occur, for instance, if
contractual parties that have been provided guarantees under project contracts will call on their guarantees. This
will mean that amounts under such facilities will become due and payable, and as discussed above, will recover
the proceeds of Collateral in priority to the Notes.

As described above, if the Super Senior Facilities are not repaid in full in prescribed amounts of time as set
forth in the Intercreditor Agreement, creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and Guarantee Facility
(including under any future guarantee facilities) as super senior creditors and / or creditors under the Pension
Guarantee Facility as super super senior creditors will become the instructing group for enforcement of the
security.

###### The Notes will not be initially secured by all of the Collateral and the Guarantors will not initially guarantee the Notes

On the Issue Date, the Notes will not be secured by all of the Collateral, as further described under “Description
_of the Notes—Security.” On the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured by the Issue Date Collateral. Within 90_
days of the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured by the Initial Post-Closing Collateral and within the later of
(a) 90 days following the Issue Date and (b) 30 days following Crayfish BidCo Oy obtaining title to all the
issued and outstanding shares in Caverion by posting security in the form required by Chapter 18, Section 6 of
the Finnish Companies Act, the Notes will be secured by the Subsequent Post-Closing Collateral. The security
interests will be limited to the same extent as those under the Super Senior Facilities and otherwise as set forth
under “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes
_Guarantees and the Security Interests,” which limitations could be significant. It should be noted that if a_
guarantee or a security interest granted by a Guarantor in certain jurisdictions is granted or perfected after the
secured obligation arose, such guarantee or security interest may be subject to claw-back provisions under
applicable local insolvency laws.

The Notes will not be guaranteed on the Issue Date. Within 90 days following the Issue Date, the obligations
of the Issuer pursuant to the Notes will, subject to the agreed security principles, be guaranteed, jointly and
severally on a senior basis, by the Initial Post-Closing Date Guarantors and within the later of (a) 90 days
following the Issue Date and (b) 30 days following Crayfish BidCo Oy obtaining title to all the issued and
outstanding shares in Caverion by posting security in the form required by Chapter 18, Section 6 of the Finnish
Companies Act, the obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Notes will, subject to the agreed security principles,
be guaranteed, jointly and severally on a senior basis, by the Subsequent Post-Closing Date Guarantors. Each
of the Guarantors will also be a guarantor under the Super Senior Facilities (which includes the Pension
Guarantee Facility and the Guarantee Facility). The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees will be
subject to significant limitations as described in “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the
_Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests.” As of and for the twelve months_
ended March 31, 2024, the Guarantors represented 77.5 per cent. of our Combined Group EBITDA and over
100 per cent. of our Combined Group Assets (other than goodwill and shares in subsidiaries), in each case,
calculated on a stand-alone basis without giving effect to intra-group eliminations (including intra-group
receivables). On an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions as of March 31, 2024, the

108


-----

subsidiaries of the Issuer that will not guarantee the Notes would have had SEK 769 million outstanding external
financial indebtedness (of which SEK 754 million was attributable to leases).

###### It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes

The Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and
other imperfections permitted under the Existing Notes Indenture, the Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement and accepted by other creditors that have the benefit of security interests in the Collateral from time
to time. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could
adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the Notes, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to
realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the first priority ranking of security interests with respect
to the Notes can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection
requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions.

The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the
realization of security interests in the Collateral. For example, the enforcement of share pledges, whether by
means of a public auction or a private sale, may be subject to certain specific requirements and the Security
Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third-party to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that
the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any
third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security
Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly
decrease. See “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the
_Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests” for further information._

###### The granting of the security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the incurrence of permitted debt or other obligations in the future, may create or restart hardening periods

The granting of security interests to secure the Notes and the Notes Guarantees may create hardening periods
for such security interests. The granting of shared security interests to secure future indebtedness or other
obligations permitted to be secured on the Collateral may restart or reopen such hardening periods in particular,
because the Indenture will permit the release and retaking of security granted in favor of the Notes in certain
circumstances, including in connection with the incurrence of future indebtedness. The applicable hardening
period for these new security interests can run from the moment each new security interest has been granted,
perfected or recreated. Each time, if the security interest granted, perfected or recreated were to be enforced
before the end of the respective hardening period, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be
possible to enforce it. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the Notes would
lose the benefit of the security interest. In the up to twelve month period prior to a Post-Closing Merger
involving the Issuer being finalized, and for the three month period after such Post-Closing Merger or after the
twelve month period, the security interest in the shares of the Issuer or the MergerCo (as defined in “Description
_of the Notes”) in favor of the Notes may be unperfected (i.e. voidable against third parties) and subject to_
hardening periods. There are additional share pledges over certain Guarantors, which collectively are holding
companies for the whole group.

The same rights and risks also will apply with respect to future security interests granted in connection with the
accession of further subsidiaries as additional Guarantors and the granting of security interests over their
relevant assets and equity interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes. See “Certain Insolvency
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security_
_Interests.”_

###### Your rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected, and its priority retained,
through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor, as applicable, of the security. The
liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we fail
or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens. Certain of the Collateral may not be
perfected under Swedish, Norwegian or Finnish or other laws, including certain share pledges pending a
potential intra-group merger, intra-group loan pledges and certain bank account pledges.

Absent perfection, the holder of the security interest may have difficulty enforcing such holder’s rights in the
Collateral with regard to third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security
interest in the same Collateral and some security interests do not actually create the purported security interest
if not properly perfected. In addition, a debtor may discharge its obligation by paying the security provider until,
but not after, the debtor receives a notification of the existence of the security interest granted by the security
provider in favor of the security taken over the claims the security taker (as creditor) has against the debtor.
Finally, since the ranking of pledges is sometimes determined by the date on which they became enforceable
against third parties, a security interest created on a later date over the same Collateral, but which came into
force for third parties earlier (by way of registration in the appropriate register or by notification) may have
priority. Neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent has any obligation or responsibility to monitor the
acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute collateral or the perfection of, or to take steps or
actions to perfect or ensure the perfection of, any security interest in the Notes against third parties. See “Certain
_Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the_
_Security Interests” for further information._

###### The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent (on behalf of the holders of the Notes) rather than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted by local law

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the
obligations of the Guarantors under the Notes Guarantees will not be granted directly to the holders of the
relevant Notes but will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent, which will hold the Collateral on behalf
of the lenders under the Super Senior Facilities and our hedging obligations, the holders of the Existing Notes,
the holders of the Notes and the holders of any additional debt secured by Collateral permitted to be incurred
under the Indenture. The Indenture will provide (along with the Intercreditor Agreement) that only the Security
Agent has the right to enforce the Security Documents. As a consequence, holders of the Notes will not have
direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing
the Notes, except through the Trustee, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture) provide instructions
to the Security Agent in respect of the Collateral. See “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on
_the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests” for further information._

It is generally possible under Swedish law to grant security interests in favor of an agent acting on behalf of
secured parties. However, to enable the Security Agent to enforce the security interests in the Collateral on
behalf of the holders of the Notes in a Swedish court, the Security Agent may need a specific power of attorney
from each holder of the Notes. It has not been established by judicial precedent or otherwise by law that a power
of attorney or mandate of agency, including the appointment of an agent can be made irrevocable. Therefore,
any powers of attorney or mandates of agency can be revoked and will terminate by operation of law and
without notice at the bankruptcy or temporal demise of the party giving such powers. In addition, the failure of
all holders of the Notes to submit such a power of attorney could negatively affect the enforcement of the
security interests in the Collateral. It should further be noted that certain security interests may be unperfected
and subject to a hardening period, please refer to the Offering for further description of the security to be

110


-----

granted. The applicable hardening period for these new security interests will run from the moment each new
security interest has been granted and perfected. If the security interest granted or recreated were to be enforced
before the end of the hardening period, it may be declared void or ineffective and it may not be possible to
enforce it.

###### The Issuer and the Guarantors will have control over the Collateral securing the Notes, and the sale of particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes

The Security Documents will allow the Issuer and the Guarantors to remain in possession of, retain exclusive
control over, freely operate and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the Collateral securing the Notes.
So long as no default or event of default under the Indenture would result therefrom, the Issuer and the
Guarantors may, among other things, without any release or consent by the Security Agent, conduct ordinary
course activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of
the Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of indebtedness.

There are circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of Notes under which the Collateral securing
the Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be released automatically and under which the Notes Guarantees will
be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Trustee.

Under various circumstances, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Notes will be released
automatically. See “Description of the Notes—Notes Guarantees” and “Description of the Notes—Security—
_Release of Liens.” In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral comprising the shares of any of our_
subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, then claims
under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees may be released or transferred. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes— Security—Release of_
_Liens.” Your ability to recover on the Notes could be materially impaired in such circumstances._

The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that the Collateral securing the Notes may be released and retaken
in connection with the refinancing of certain indebtedness, including the Notes. Such a release and retaking of
Collateral may give rise to the start of a new “hardening period” in respect of such Collateral. Under certain
circumstances, other creditors, insolvency administrators or representatives or courts could challenge the
validity and enforceability of the grant of such Collateral. Any such challenge, if successful, could potentially
limit your recovery in respect of such Collateral and thus reduce your recovery under the Notes. See also “—
_The granting of the security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the incurrence of permitted_
_debt or other obligations in the future, may create or restart hardening periods.”_

###### The Notes will mature after a substantial portion of our other indebtedness, including the Existing Notes and the Super Senior Facilities.

The Existing Notes will mature on July 5, 2029 and the Super Senior Facilities will mature on the date that is
three months prior to the maturity date of the Existing Notes. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—The Existing Notes and the Existing Notes Indenture” and “Description of Certain Financing_
_Arrangements—The Super Senior Facilities.” We may not have sufficient cash to repay all amounts due at_
maturity. If we do not have sufficient cash to repay such amounts when due, we will need to refinance such
indebtedness. There can be no assurance that we will have the ability to borrow or otherwise raise the amounts
necessary to repay such amounts. We may not be able to refinance such indebtedness on satisfactory terms, if
at all, and would be required to do so prior to the maturity of the Notes. Accordingly, either via a refinancing or
at their scheduled maturity dates, we will be required to repay substantially all of our other creditors, including
holders of the Existing Notes and lenders under the Super Senior Facilities, before we are required to repay the
principal of the Notes, and, as a result, may not have sufficient cash to repay all amounts due on the Notes at
maturity.

111


-----

###### The Issuer does not have revenue generating operations of its own and will depend on cash flows from operating companies to make payments on the Notes

The Issuer does not have any revenue-generating activities of its own and does not have any business operations
or material assets (other than certain management activities recharged to other group companies). Repayment
of the Issuer’s indebtedness, including under the Notes, is dependent on the profitability and cash flow of its
subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to the Issuer, by dividend distributions, or otherwise.
The subsidiaries of the Issuer may not be able to, or may be restricted by the terms of their existing or future
indebtedness, or by law, in their ability to make distributions or advance upstream loans to enable us to make
payments in respect of our indebtedness, including the Notes. Each of the subsidiaries of the Issuer is a distinct
legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain
cash from the subsidiaries of the Issuer.

While the Indenture and the Super Senior Facilities, respectively, will limit the ability of the Group’s
subsidiaries to incur contractual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany
payments to us, such limitations are subject to certain significant qualifications and exceptions. In the event that
we do not receive distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required
principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, including the Notes. We do not expect to have any other
sources of funds that would allow us to make payments to holders of the Notes.

###### The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-Guarantor members of our Group

Some, but not all, of the members of the Group will guarantee the Notes. As of and for the twelve months ended
March 31, 2024, the Guarantors represented 77.5 per cent. of our Combined Group EBITDA and over 100 per
cent. of our Combined Group Assets (other than goodwill and shares in subsidiaries), in each case, calculated
on a stand-alone basis without giving effect to intra-group eliminations (including intra-group receivables). On
an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions as of March 31, 2024, the subsidiaries of the Issuer
that will not guarantee the Notes would have had SEK 769 million outstanding external financial indebtedness
(of which SEK 754 million was attributable to leases).

Unless a member of our Group is a Guarantor, such member will not have any obligations to pay amounts due
under the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose. The Indenture will, subject to some limitations,
permit our non-Guarantor restricted subsidiaries to incur substantial amounts of additional indebtedness and
will not restrict the amount of other liabilities that may be incurred by these subsidiaries. Generally, holders of
indebtedness of, and trade creditors of, non-guarantor companies, including lenders under bank financing
agreements, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such non-Guarantor companies before
these assets are made available for distribution to the Issuer or any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder.

Accordingly, in the event that any non-Guarantor company becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or
dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction:

- the creditors of the Issuer (including the holders of the Notes) and the Guarantors will have no right to
proceed against the assets of such company; and

- the creditors of such non-guarantor company, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to
payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such company before the Issuer or any
Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions from such
subsidiary.

As such, the Notes and each Notes Guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade
creditors) and any preferred stockholders of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries.

112


-----

###### The Notes Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability

The Notes will be guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries which are incorporated under the laws of Sweden,
Norway and Finland and will be secured by security interests over the Collateral, which will be governed by
the laws of these jurisdictions. The Indenture will provide that the Notes Guarantees, and the Indenture and the
relevant Security Documents will provide that the security interests, will be limited to the maximum amount
that can be guaranteed, or otherwise, or in respect of which security interests may be granted, by the relevant
Guarantor or grantor, as applicable, without rendering the relevant Notes Guarantee or security interest, as it
relates to that Guarantor or grantor, voidable or otherwise ineffective or limited under applicable law. See
“Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees
_and the Security Interests.”_

In addition, enforcement of any of the Notes Guarantees against any Guarantor or security interests against any
security provider will be subject to certain defenses available to Guarantors or security providers, as applicable,
in the relevant jurisdiction. Although laws differ among these jurisdictions, these laws and defenses generally
include those that relate to corporate purpose or benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference,
insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, financial assistance, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization,
capital maintenance, set-off, counter-claim and prescription (time bar) or similar laws, regulations or defenses
affecting the rights of creditors generally. If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, a Guarantor
or grantor of security interests may have no liability or decreased liability under its Notes Guarantee or security
interest, as applicable, depending on the amount of its other obligations and applicable law.

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other
laws, a court could (i) subordinate or void any Notes Guarantee or any security interest (ii) direct that the holders
of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Notes Guarantee or security interest to the relevant Guarantor or
security provider, or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors or (iii) take other action that is
detrimental to you, typically if the court found that:

- the Notes Guarantee or security interest was granted with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud
creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or the security provider or, in certain jurisdictions, even when
the recipient was merely aware that the Guarantor or the security provider was insolvent when it granted
the relevant Notes Guarantee or security;

- the Guarantor or security provider did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for
the granting of the Notes Guarantee and/or security interest and the Guarantor or security provider: (i)
was insolvent or was rendered insolvent as a result of having granted the relevant Notes Guarantee or
security interest; (ii) was under-capitalized or became under-capitalized because of the relevant Notes
Guarantee or security interest; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness
beyond its ability to pay at maturity;

- the granting of the relevant Notes Guarantee and/or security interest was held to constitute prohibited
financial assistance;

- the granting of the relevant Notes Guarantee and/or security interest was held not to be in the best
interests or not to be for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor or security provider or was held to exceed
the corporate objects of the Guarantor or security provider; or

- the aggregate amounts paid or payable under the relevant Notes Guarantee or enforcement proceeds
under the relevant security were in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law.

113


-----

These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee granted by any of our subsidiaries pursuant to the
Indenture.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon applicable governing
law. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if:

- the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all its assets;

- the present fair value of its assets was less than the amount required to pay its existing debts and
liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they became due; or

- it could not pay its debts as they became due.

We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was “insolvent”
at the relevant time or that, regardless of the method of the valuation, a court would not determine that a
Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a
Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Notes Guarantee was issued, that payments to holders of the Notes
constituted preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds.

The liability of each Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee, or security provider under the relevant Security
Document, will be limited to the amount that will result in such Notes Guarantee or security interest not
constituting a fraudulent preference or conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set
aside. However, there can be no assurances as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of
the maximum liability of each Guarantor or security provider. There is a possibility that the entire Notes
Guarantee or security interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished.

If a court were to find that the issuance of the Notes or a Notes Guarantee, or the granting of the security, was
a fraudulent preference or conveyance or unenforceable for any other reason, the court could hold that the
payment obligations under the Notes or such Notes Guarantee or Security Document are ineffective, could void
the security over the Collateral, or could require the holders of the relevant Notes to repay any amounts received
with respect to the Notes or such Notes Guarantee or any enforcement proceeds received from enforcement of
the security. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent preference or conveyance occurred, you may cease to
have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor or security provider and would be a creditor solely of the
Issuer, any other Guarantor or security provider, if applicable, under any Notes Guarantees or Security
Documents that have not been declared void.

Additionally, any future pledge or charge of Collateral in favor of the Security Agent, including pursuant to
Security Documents delivered after the date of the Indenture, might be avoidable by the security provider (as
debtor-in-possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy (or similar officer) if certain events or circumstances exist
or occur, including, among others, if the security provider is insolvent at the time of the pledge or charge, the
pledge or charge permits the holders of the Notes to receive a greater recovery than if the pledge or charge had
not been given and a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the security provider is commenced within a certain
time period following the pledge or charge.

###### Enforcement of the rights of the holders of the Notes under the Indenture across multiple jurisdictions may be difficult and the applicable insolvency laws may preclude holders of the Notes from recovering payments due on the Notes

The Indenture, the Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be governed by the laws of the State of New York, the
Intercreditor Agreement will be governed by the laws of England and Wales, and the Security Documents
granting security interests in the Collateral will be governed by the laws of a number of different jurisdictions.
Moreover, the Issuer and the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Sweden, Norway and Finland.
Therefore, in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in these and

114


-----

other applicable jurisdictions. The rights of the holders of the Notes under the Indenture will thus be subject to
the laws of a number of jurisdictions, and it may be difficult to effectively enforce such rights in multiple
bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar proceedings. Moreover, such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are
typically complex and costly for creditors and often result in substantial uncertainty and delay in the
enforcement of creditors’ rights. In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administration and other laws of the
jurisdiction of incorporation of the Issuer and the Guarantors may be materially different from, or in conflict
with, one another, including creditors’ rights, priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and
the duration of the insolvency proceeding. The application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could
trigger disputes over which jurisdictions’ law should apply and could adversely affect the ability to realize any
recovery under the Notes.

###### Our hedging agreements may expose us to credit default risks and potential losses if our hedging counterparties fall into bankruptcy

We are party to certain interest rate swaps and we may enter into additional interest hedging agreements to
hedge our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, primarily under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing
Notes and the Floating Rate Notes. Under any such agreements, we are exposed to credit risks of our
counterparties. If one or more of our counterparties falls into bankruptcy, claims we have under the swap
agreements or other hedging arrangements may become worthless. Also, such hedging activities may be
ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from interest rate or
foreign currency fluctuations. In addition, in the event that we refinance our debt or otherwise terminate hedging
agreements, we may be required to make termination payments, which may result in a loss.

###### We may not be able to obtain the funds required to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control and the occurrence of certain important corporate events will not constitute a Change of Control

The Indenture will contain provisions relating to certain events constituting a “Change of Control” (as defined
in the Indenture). Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, we will be required to offer to repurchase all
outstanding Notes at a price equal to 101 per cent. of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest
and additional amounts, if any, to the date of repurchase. If a Change of Control were to occur, we cannot assure
you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide
to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the Super Senior
Facilities, the Existing Notes Indenture, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other than existing
contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A Change of Control may trigger a
mandatory prepayment of the Super Senior Facilities and other indebtedness, including the Existing Notes. The
repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the
Change of Control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from its subsidiaries to allow it to
pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control, may be limited by our
then existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required
repurchases. If an event constituting a Change of Control were to occur at a time when our Group is prohibited
from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the
lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that
contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer would remain
prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require third-party financing to
make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control. We cannot assure you that our Group would
be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a
default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Revolving Credit Facility. See
“Description of the Notes—Change of Control.”

The Change of Control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the
event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar

115


-----

transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift
in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a Change of Control as defined
in the Indenture. Except as described under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control,” the Indenture will
not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of
a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction.

In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of control under the
Indenture will be deemed not to be a change of control if, at the time, our consolidated net leverage ratio is less
than certain specified levels. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the
_Notes—Certain Definitions—Specified Change of Control Event.”_

The definition of Change of Control in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries (if any), taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a
limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established
definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of
uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the
Issuer’s assets and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a
Change of Control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the relevant
Notes.

###### The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies

Owners of the book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of relevant Notes unless and until
definitive notes are issued in exchange for book-entry interests. Instead, the common depositary (or its nominee)
for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the Notes in global form.

Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the Notes in global form will be
made to the Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, such payments
will be credited to Euroclear and Clearstream participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the Notes
in global form and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to Euroclear and
Clearstream, none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, Transfer Agent, Paying Agent, the Calculation
Agent or the Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or
payments of interest, principal or other amounts to Euroclear and Clearstream, or to owners of book-entry
interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest in the Notes, you must rely on the procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream and, if you are not a participant in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, on the procedures
of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the
Notes under the Indenture.

Owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon our solicitations for consents or requests
for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes, including the enforcement of security for the Notes and
the Notes Guarantees. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be reliant on the common depositary
(or its nominee) (as registered holder of the Notes) to act on your instructions and/or will be permitted to act
directly only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream or,
if applicable, from a participant. We cannot assure you that procedures implemented for the granting of such
proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any requested actions or to take any other action on a timely
basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until the relevant Definitive
Registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be
restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. We cannot assure you that the procedures to be

116


-----

implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under
the Notes. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.”

###### There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited

We cannot assure you as to:

- the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

- your ability to sell your Notes; or

- the price at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing
interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for noninvestment-grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices
of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by
a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in
prices. The trading market for the Notes may attract different investors and this may affect the extent to which
the Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such
disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial
performance. As a result, there can be no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Notes. If
no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at
all.

Although an application will be made to the Authority for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on
the Official List of the Exchange, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be or remain listed. Although no
assurance can be made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of the admission to the Official List of the
Exchange, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting (whether or not for an alternative admission to
listing on another stock exchange) of the Notes from the Official List of the Exchange may have a material
effect on a holder’s ability to resell the Notes in the secondary market.

In addition, the Indenture will allow us to issue additional Notes in the future, which could adversely impact
the liquidity of the relevant Notes.

###### United States civil liabilities may not be enforceable against us

The Issuer and the Guarantors are located in Sweden, Norway and Finland and all of our assets are located
outside the United States. In addition, all of the members of our board and our officers reside outside the United
States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us
or such other persons residing outside the United States, or to enforce outside the United States judgments
obtained against such persons in United States courts in any action. In addition, it may be difficult for investors
to enforce, in original actions brought in courts in jurisdictions located outside the United States, rights
predicated upon United States laws. See “Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.”

Sweden, Norway and Finland currently do not have a treaty with the United States providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters.
This may give rise to difficulties in respect of the enforcement in Sweden, Norway and Finland of judgments
obtained in the United States. In particular, a judgment entered against a company incorporated in Sweden in
the courts of a state which is not a Member State (as defined in the Recast Brussels Regulation) or a Contracting
State (as defined in the Lugano Convention), such as the United States, would not be recognized or enforceable
in Sweden as a matter of law without a retrial. In addition, a Swedish court may choose to retry the dispute
without regard to the previous judgment. See “Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.”

###### Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The credit ratings address
our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks in determining the likelihood
that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all
risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed above and other factors that may affect
the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject
to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit
rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn
entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension,
reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the relevant Notes by one or more of the
credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost, terms and conditions of our financings, and could adversely
affect the value and trading of the Notes.

###### Certain covenants may be suspended upon the occurrence of a change in our ratings

The Indenture will provide that, if at any time following the date of the Indenture, the Notes receive a rating of
“Baa3” or better from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) or “BBB-” or better from Standard &
Poor’s Financial Services LLC (“S&P”) or Fitch Ratings Inc. (“Fitch”) and no default or event of default has
occurred and is continuing, then beginning that day and continuing until such time that the Notes receive a
rating of below “Baa3” from Moody’s or “BBB-” from S&P or Fitch, certain covenants will cease to be
applicable to the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on
_Achievement of Investment Grade Status.” If these covenants were to cease to be applicable, we would be able_
to incur additional indebtedness or make payments, including dividends or investments, which may conflict
with the interests of holders of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve an
investment grade rating or that any such rating will be maintained.

###### The transferability of the Notes may be limited under applicable securities laws, which may affect their liquidity and the price at which they may be sold

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or the
securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the
United States, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and the applicable securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction. The
Notes are not being offered for sale in the United States except to QIBs in accordance with Rule 144A. In
addition, by acceptance of delivery of any Notes, the holder thereof agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of
any investor accounts for which it has purchased the Notes that it shall not transfer the Notes in an aggregate
principal amount of less than €100,000. We have not agreed to or otherwise undertaken to register the Notes
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (including by way of an exchange offer). See “Transfer
_Restrictions.” It is the obligation of holders of the Notes to ensure that their offers and sales of the Notes within_
the United States and other countries comply with applicable securities laws.

###### Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If investors measure their investment returns by reference
to a currency other than euro, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange-related risks due to,
among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro relative to the currency by reference
to which such investors measure the return on their investments. These changes may be due to economic,
political and other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the euro against the currency by
reference to which such investors measure the return on their investments could cause a decrease in the effective
yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on the

-----

Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which such investors measure the return on their
investments.

###### The interests of holders of each series of the Notes may be inconsistent.

The Notes will be issued pursuant to the Indenture and will vote as a single class with respect to amendments,
waivers or other modifications of the Indenture other than with respect to amendments, waivers or other
modifications that will only affect the relevant series of Fixed Rate Notes or Floating Rate Notes, as the case
may be. The Fixed Rate Notes will have a different interest rate, call schedule and call protection and will have
other features that will differ from the Floating Rate Notes. As a result of these differences, the interests of
holders of each series of Notes could conflict. In addition, the holders of one series of Notes may be in a position
to agree to certain terms in a consent solicitation that would be beneficial to such series of Notes but adverse to
the economic interest of the other series of Notes; however, to the extent the relevant amendment or waiver is
approved by the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (subject to
the limited exceptions described above), all holders of the Notes will be bound by such amendment.
Furthermore, subject to certain restrictions, further series of additional notes may be issued under the Indenture
which may have different terms in respect of currency, interest rate and certain other matters. Such additional
notes will generally vote as a single class with other series of notes issued under the Indenture but may have
interests that differ from the holders of any other series of notes issued under the Indenture, including the Notes.

###### Risks Related to Our Ownership

 The interests of our principal shareholders may conflict with your interests as a holder of the Notes

The interests of our controlling shareholders may conflict with yours as a holder of the Notes, particularly if we
encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. The controlling shareholders have
(directly or indirectly) the power to, among other things, affect our legal and capital structure and our day-today operations and may have an incentive to increase the value of their investments or cause us to distribute
funds at the expense of our financial condition, which could impact our ability to make payments on the Notes.
In addition, the controlling shareholders have the power to elect a majority of our board of directors and appoint
new officers and management and, therefore, effectively control many other major decisions regarding our
operations. We cannot assure you that the interests of the controlling shareholders will not conflict with your
interests as a holder of the Notes. See “Principal Shareholder” and “Certain Relationships and Related Party
_Transactions.”_

###### Overview

We are one of the Nordic region’s leading providers of smart and sustainable installation and service solutions,
with our primary activities focusing on electrical engineering, heating & sanitation, ventilation and smart
buildings & automation, such as building management systems (“BMS”) and individual metering and debiting
(“IMD”), as well as key competencies in data & telecoms, industrial pipes, district heating, cooling, sprinklers,
security and green technology solutions (“GreenTech”).

We hold a strong position in the growing installation market in the Nordic countries in which we operate
(comprising Sweden, Norway and Finland). Our multi-technical offering, market share and size have enhanced
our position as an experienced and trusted partner that provides reliable and efficient high-quality services in
the context of an ongoing transformation towards a more energy-efficient and sustainable society.

We provide design, installation, maintenance and service solutions for a wide range of properties, industrial
facilities and infrastructure projects for a diverse customer base, which include construction companies, the
public sector, property owners and industrial companies. Our installation business consists of the installation
of technical systems as part of the construction of new properties and the renovation or upgrade of technical
systems as part of the reconstruction and renovation of properties, improving their functionality and comfort.
Our design and maintenance capabilities complement our installation business. Lastly, our service business
consists of the operation, maintenance, repair, replacement, reconfiguration and monitoring of technical
installations in buildings, industrial plants and infrastructure. We take on primarily two types of assignments:
contractor assignments (which include new construction projects and major renovations) and service
assignments (which include service, maintenance and minor renovation assignments).

Our operations are decentralized and governed based on a shared framework, clear allocation of roles and
responsibilities and systematic monitoring. Before the Caverion Combination, Assemblin’s operating
organization was divided into five specific business areas: three in Sweden (Assemblin Electrical, Assemblin
H&S and Assemblin Ventilation), one in Norway (Assemblin Norway) and one in Finland, which also includes
BMS products and IMD operations in Sweden and Norway (Assemblin Finland), comprising approximately
189 units (which are the physical branches) with 7,077 FTE employees in the Nordic region as of March 31,
2024. We believe that our decentralized business model contributes to the profitability of our operations. This
decentralized and entrepreneurial business model allows us to swiftly adjust to a largely variable cost structure
and promotes enterprise and accountability at all levels of our structure, with the president of each business
area being responsible for managing the operations and earnings of the respective business areas.

###### Our Segments

The operating segments in both the Assemblin Financing Group and the Assemblin Group are based primarily
on the main operational orientation the segments have. The operating segments comprise:

- _Assemblin Electrical: offers design, installation, service and maintenance of electrical systems_
(including GreenTech solutions such as solar cells and electric vehicles charging) and BMS solutions in
Sweden.

- _Assemblin H&S: offers design, installation, service and maintenance of technical systems for heating,_
sanitation, industrial pipes, heat pumps, sprinklers and district and geothermal heating in Sweden.

- _Assemblin Ventilation: offers design, construction, installation, service and maintenance of ventilation_
and cooling systems in Sweden, as well as two specialized workshops producing rectangular ventilation
ducts.

124


-----

- _Assemblin Norway: offers installation and service solutions within electrical, heating and sanitation and_
ventilation solutions, mainly in the greater Oslo area and surrounding regions.

- _Assemblin Finland: offers technical installation and service solutions within the technical disciplines_
electrical, heating and sanitation, ventilation, cooling, energy efficiency, IMD, geothermal and heat
pumps and BMS solutions (including products) in Finland as well as in Sweden and Norway for BMS
products and IMD.

This division into segments is the primary division that our management observes as regards earnings, capital
requirements and cash flows.

###### Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations

 General Economic Conditions and Activity in the Installation Market

Macroeconomic conditions and GDP fluctuations in Sweden, Norway and Finland, the geographic markets in
which we operate, affect customer demand and, in turn, our results of operations. During periods of strong GDP
growth, our activity benefits from increased demand from both the private and public sectors, which has a
positive impact on our order intake and backlog. Recessionary periods affect our activities differently. During
a downturn, our installation business typically experiences a decline in net revenue resulting from reduced
levels of capital investments by our customers. This includes reduced spending by national and local authorities,
as well as industrial and utility companies, although public sector expenditure tends to decrease less relative to
private sector spending. However, we usually have the opportunity to adopt appropriate and pre-emptive
measures to adjust our cost base and protect our margins, as installation is one of the last steps in the cycle of a
construction project. In contrast to the more cyclical installation business, our service business provides a stable
source of income during recessionary periods, as demand in our service business, which is mainly driven by
renovation and maintenance expenditures, has been generally resilient to macroeconomic changes and is in
many cases countercyclical, providing a more stable source of income. When macroeconomic conditions
improve, we generally experience increases in revenues in both our installation business and our service
business, as well as increased order flow.

During the 2021 period, macroeconomic conditions remained generally stable, with high activity levels in the
installation market. Housing construction slowed down in the metropolitan regions, which was however offset
by increased public investments in primarily major infrastructure projects, hospitals and schools. Additionally,
while the COVID-19 pandemic had a material impact on businesses around the world and initially negatively
affected the global economy, our results of operations and EBITA margins remained relatively resilient through
the affected periods and any negative impact we experienced was primarily as a result of operational disruptions,
and was not demand driven. The macroeconomic environment in Europe has deteriorated since the second
quarter of 2022. The Russian invasion of Ukraine in February of 2022 fueled inflation through the economy,
caused a general rise in interest rates from central banks and has put into doubt Western Europe’s energy supply,
particularly in countries that are dependent on imported fossil fuels, all leading to an environment of uncertainty
that has had an effect on the construction industry in the countries where we operate. We have experienced
higher costs of production, along with the handling of delayed deliveries, as a result of rising inflation, higher
energy prices and supply chain disruptions caused by the geopolitical situation in Europe. Higher interest rates,
which came as a result of central bank increases to combat inflation starting in 2022, also make it more difficult
for our customers to secure financing for new construction projects.

Despite these factors, the level of activity in the installation market was high in 2022. Although housing starts
construction in the larger cities and new production of commercial properties decreased, high energy prices
boosted interest in green technology and energy efficiency measures. We also experienced higher demand from
public customers, as well as for solutions for intelligent buildings and security technology, which contributed

125


-----

to our strong order intake in 2022, despite the increased uncertainty. Additionally, due to our ability to transfer
price increases to customers, the price of our services offered offset inflation in 2022, resulting in stable margins
and double digit organic growth. In 2023, all of the Nordic countries were in recession at the same time as
inflation and interest rates were high. For the installation markets, the signals from the market were mixed.
Although, the housing market slowed sharply and the market situation for new commercial properties and green
technology weakened in some locations, demand for public buildings and industrial properties remained
favorable throughout the Nordic region. The services market also experienced stable growth through 2023 and
order intake was strong.

If these factors continue, however, and spark a deep and prolonged recession in the markets in which we operate,
this can have a negative impact on our results of operation. Geopolitical tensions between Russia and the United
States, United Kingdom and other European nations have continued to escalate since the invasion of Ukraine
and more recently the attacks in Israel by Hamas on October 7, 2023 and the conflict that followed in the Gaza
Strip have created an unstable geopolitical environment in the Middle East and globally as other nations get
involved, including with respect to the global threat of terrorism, which has increasingly targeted Europe in
recent years.

###### Active Portfolio Management

We aim to grow sustainably the number of high-margin projects for our installation and service businesses, with
a diversified customer base in a wide range of end-markets. When one of our end-markets is experiencing lower
capital investments, we may benefit from spending in another end-market. For example, hospitals are generally
not impacted by the business cycle while industrial customers are more exposed. We also actively reallocate
resources in response to varying demand in our geographical regions, such as our move in Assemblin Sweden
from an original focus on residential towards servicing clients in the public sector and security. Our installation
business order book provides sales visibility and allows active project portfolio management. We actively
monitor our order intake and order backlog. Order intake represents the value of projects received during any
relevant period, plus changes to existing projects made during that period. Order backlog represents the
production value in all projects that is remaining and not yet accrued.

We have a strong focus on operational excellence and a corporate culture focused on profitability over volume.
We believe that implementation of systematic project selection and process management measures are
important factors to deliver continued margin improvement.

###### Our Cost Structure and Operational Improvement Programs

We have a flexible cost structure, which helps to preserve margins during economic downturns. Variable and
semi-variable costs (including subcontracting costs, salaries for temporary and fixed-term employees and
installation materials, tools, equipment and consumables used) constituted approximately 88 per cent of our
2023 Aggregated Total cost base. We maintain low levels of inventory and our suppliers deliver directly to our
work sites, which helps reduce our fixed costs and allows us to adjust our cost structure in response to market
demand. In less successful units we can rapidly adjust our cost base as we reduce low margin volumes, as we
have recently done in Finland. Even in more successful units, fluctuations in local markets mean that we are
continually resizing our cost base to maintain overall margins. Since 2020, owing to the improving quality of
our branch network, we have not had any comprehensive restructuring programs although we have reorganized
a handful of units each year as part of our ordinary course of business.

###### Cash Conversion Trends

Cash conversion is typically above 100 per cent. but fluctuates depending on the revenue mix, with the higher
margin service and GreenTech businesses also requiring higher working capital, driving lower cash conversion.
In addition, projects typically carry negative working capital for most of the production time but move to
positive working capital towards the end of the project’s production cycle, meaning a period of higher order

126


-----

intake than revenue typically drives an increase of working capital. In 2022 we saw an increase in working
capital driven by the uncertainty in component supply chains combined with strong production driving a buildup in buffer inventory and pre-deliveries to maintain production efficiency. Through 2023 and the three months
ended March 31, 2024 there was an improvement in the cash conversion trend which was partially offset due
to headwinds from our revenue mix.

We are continually focusing on improving net working capital, especially in successful, acquired businesses
that have a less ingrained cash culture in relation to the rest of the Group.

###### Seasonality

Our revenues and costs are subject to seasonal variation, limiting the overall comparability of interim financial
periods. The third quarter is typically the weakest quarter of the year in terms of revenue, margins and cash
flow generation due to the summer holidays. The first quarter of the year typically generates lower revenue and
margins due to lower production work due to winter weather, holidays (new year and, from time to time, Easter)
as well as the calendar effect whereby a greater number of projects close in the fourth quarter of the previous
year. Relatedly, the fourth quarter typically represents the strongest and most profitable quarter due to favorable
calendar effect due to a greater number of projects closing by the end of the year. We account for revenue in
accordance with the degree of completion of the project. Therefore, when a public holiday falls in a given
interim period, there are fewer working days and as a result we recognize less revenue from our ongoing
projects.

Our working capital needs are seasonal, although they are generally negative due to our customer contracts and
focus on invoice collection. We invoice our customers regularly, in the case of ongoing and completed
installation and service projects. Cash flow tends to be generally the strongest in the fourth quarter with public
and private sector customers seeking to meet their maintenance and operating expenses budgets but also due to
many projects being completed in this quarter before the year-end and onset of winter. Cash flow in August and
September tends to be relatively weaker because of lower business activity in the month of July and August,
which is the main annual holiday period in our markets.

The Assemblin Financing Group experienced seasonally strong cash flows during the first quarter of 2023,
which were positively effected by the seasonal improvement in net working capital typical for the first quarter,
although somewhat less marked than the first quarter of 2022. However, we have experienced several factors
in 2022 that increased our working capital requirements including: (i) increased share of revenue mix for capital
intensive services and GreenTech business; (ii) requirements to purchase materials and components ahead of
payment schedules to secure production increasing revenue recognized and not invoiced as well as inventories;
and (iii) changes in the project revenue mix as a lower share of larger projects in recent order intake and
increased cost-plus projects affect working capital negatively. Although working capital requirements and cash
flow trends have improved in 2023, we will likely experience a further increase in working capital needs if the
markets in which we operate are subject to significant recessionary periods due to the current macroeconomic
environment. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Amounts included in our
_estimated order backlog may not result in actual revenue or translate into profits, and our estimated order_
_backlog is subject to delays, customer bankruptcy, accounting errors and unexpected adjustments and is_
_therefore an uncertain indicator of future results of operations.” Increased demand in our service business,_
which tends to be countercyclical, typically result in more working capital outflows, as compared to our
installation projects.

###### Foreign Currency Exchange Rates

Our reported results of operations and financial condition are affected by exchange rate fluctuations due to both
transactional and translational exposure. Our business operations are characterized by a relatively low level of
transactional currency risk since our purchases and sales are typically made in the same local currency with

127


-----

minimal exposure to imported components. However, we are exposed to risks relating to translation into
Swedish kronor of income statements and balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries with local reporting
denominated in euro (in the case of operations in Finland) and Norwegian kroner.

_Transactional risk: Transactional risk arises when our subsidiaries execute transactions in a currency other than_
their functional currency. Transactions in foreign currency are restated in the functional currency at the
exchange rate in effect on the transaction date. Functional currency is the currency in which the primary
financial environments where the companies conduct their operations. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign
currency are restated in the functional currency at the exchange rate in effect on the balance-sheet date.
Exchange rate differences arising in the restatements are recognized in profit or loss for the year. Non-monetary
assets and liabilities recognized at historical cost are restated at the exchange rate on the transaction date. Nonmonetary assets and liabilities recognized at fair value are restated in the functional currency at the exchange
rate in effect on the date of measurement at fair value. We generally benefit from a natural hedge against
currency fluctuations in the three countries in which we operate because we incur costs and receive revenues in
the applicable local currency. However, we purchase equipment from suppliers who generally operate in euro,
and these suppliers may change their Swedish krona or Norwegian krone prices to reflect fluctuations in the
Swedish krona or Norwegian krone to euro exchange rate.

_Financial reports from operations abroad: Assets and liabilities in operations abroad, including goodwill and_
other Group-related surpluses and deficits, are restated from the functional currency of the operations abroad
in the Group’s reporting currency at the exchange rate in effect on the balance-sheet date. Long-term loans to
subsidiaries designated by the parent as part of its net investment in foreign operations are treated as equity for
translational purposes with the differences being recognized in other comprehensive income. Revenue and
expenses in operations abroad are restated in Swedish kronor at an average rate that constituted an
approximation of the exchange rates that were in effect on the respective transaction dates. Translation
differences arising in connection with currency restatements are recognized in Other comprehensive income,
and are accumulated in a separate component in equity, designated as translation reserves. In the event the
operations abroad are not wholly owned, the translation difference is allocated to holdings with a noncontrolling interest based on its proportional ownership share. When controlling interest, significant interest or
joint controlling interest for operations abroad are dissolved, the accumulated translation differences
attributable to the operations are realized, at which point they are reclassified from the translation reserves in
equity to profit or loss for the year. In the event a sale occurs but controlling interest remains, a proportional
share of accumulated translation differences from the translation reserve is transferred to holdings with a noncontrolling interest. In the event of a sale of portions of associates and joint ventures where significant interest
or joint controlling interest remains, a proportional share of the translation differences are reclassified to profit
or loss for the year.

We did not experience significant gains or losses as a result of fluctuations of Norwegian kroner and the euro
against Swedish kronor during the periods under review, other than the exchange rate loss on the unsecured
portion of our bond notes and non-SEK cash balances.

###### Personnel Costs and Availability of Skilled Personnel

For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022 and the 2023 Aggregated Total, we had personnel costs of
SEK 4,218 million, SEK 4,858 million and SEK 5,490 million (comprised of SEK 1,811 million for the
Assemblin Financing Group for the four-month period ended May 2, 2023 and SEK 3,679 million for the
Assemblin Group for the eight-month period ended December 31, 2023), respectively, which accounted for
41.6 per cent., 38.3 per cent. and 38.6 per cent., respectively of our total operating expenses (which includes
costs of production and selling and administrative expenses) of SEK 10,148 million, SEK 12,686 million and
SEK 14,219 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022 and the 2023 Aggregated Total
(comprised of SEK 4,546 million for the Assemblin Financing Group for the four-month period ended May 2,

128


-----

2023 and SEK 9,673 million for the Assemblin Group for the eight-month period ended December 31, 2023),
respectively. While several of our project assignment contracts include indexation provisions for wage increases
which allow us to pass increases of costs on to our customers, increases in personnel costs can have a material
impact on our result of operations. As almost all of our labor force is subject to collective bargaining agreements,
wages are generally subject to annual increases determined by the labor unions in accordance with the collective
bargaining agreements. In addition, our growth can at times be constrained by our ability to find skilled labor
force necessary to complete our installation projects or perform service assignments. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to Our Business and Industry—Our success is highly dependent on the ability to recruit and retain_
_technical and other key personnel.”_

###### Equipment and Materials Used

We purchase equipment (machinery, technical equipment and installation equipment) and installation materials
in the ordinary course of our business. Our expenses for this equipment and these materials are subject to
fluctuations based on our activity levels and the prices of the equipment and materials we purchase. During
periods of strong economic growth, our expenditures on equipment and other materials are higher, due to the
fact that our installation business, which requires more purchases of materials, makes up a larger share of our
total sales than is the case during recessionary periods. We continually seek to consolidate our purchases to
achieve volume-based discounts from our suppliers. During economic downturns, when our service business
makes up a larger share of our total sales than our installation business, our expenditures on equipment and
other materials are lower, due to the fact that maintenance services require the use of less equipment and
materials. The prices of the equipment we purchase are subject to variation based on the fluctuations in the
prices of raw materials (primarily aluminium, copper and steel) used to produce that equipment. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Fluctuating commodity prices, including as a result of_
_geographical conflict or macroeconomic factors, may adversely impact our results of operations.”_

###### Acquisitions

In recent years, external growth has contributed to the overall growth of our business, and we intend to continue
to pursue acquisitions to increase our market presence, our service offering and our service capacity. Since
January 1, 2021, excluding the Caverion Combination, we have completed the acquisition of an additional 45
companies and businesses in Sweden, Norway and Finland, and across each of our business areas, with
estimated aggregated annual sales of over SEK 2.8 billion, of which 11 were completed in Norway (with
estimated aggregate annual sales of SEK 0.5 billion), 28 acquisitions were completed in Sweden (with estimated
aggregate annual sales of SEK 1.3 billion) and 6 acquisitions were completed in Finland (with estimated
aggregate annual sales of SEK 1.0 billion). In Sweden, 17 acquisitions were completed within Assemblin
Electrical, 8 within Assemblin H&S, 3 within Assemblin Ventilation.

In the three months ended March 31, 2024, we completed 2 small “bolt-on” acquisitions in Sweden and Norway:
Elservice Västra Götaland AB (Assemblin Electrical) and Skaugen Blikk & Ventilation AS (Assemblin
Norway). These companies have a total of over 20 employees and estimated aggregated annual revenues of
SEK 45 million. These acquisitions were made with cash on balance sheet. Additional cash consideration of up
to SEK 0.5 million was payable over the next year as of March 31, 2024. We also completed the Caverion
Combination on April 1, 2024, which is after the period under review and is thus not included in our results
below. For a discussion on Caverion’s results of operation, please see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
_of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Caverion.”_

We estimate, based on each company’s historical EBITDA derived from its management accounts, as adjusted
in a manner consistent with the adjustments applied to our Adjusted EBITDA, to the extent applicable, and as
further adjusted for the application of our accounting policies and other items, that the acquisitions completed

129


-----

during the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, would have had a positive EBITDA impact of approximately
SEK 25 million for the same period, if each of the acquisitions was completed on April 1, 2023.

We have been successful in integrating acquired businesses in the past and have achieved meaningful synergies
that have resulted in increased EBITA Margins and profitability. We focus on realizing synergies from (i)
procurement savings resulting from having the acquired business purchase installation material, tools and
equipment under our purchase agreements with our suppliers, which provide for better commercial terms,
compared to the existing supply contracts of the acquired business, (ii) sharing our best practice with the
acquired business, or the acquired business’ best practice with the rest of our Group, resulting in improved
profitability and (iii) the acquired business benefitting from our specialists in areas such as design and tender
process, legal, procurement, human resources (“HR”) and communication. We typically realize these synergies
over a certain period of time after the acquisition, and not immediately, to ensure compatibility with the
established processes in usually already well-run businesses. Non- recurring costs related to these acquisitions
are discussed under “—Items Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations” below.

###### Items Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations

Items affecting comparability are categorized as acquisition, integration and start-up costs, restructuring costs,
transformation costs and other adjustments. These items, which are discussed below, do not occur regularly and
affect comparability between periods both, year over year and quarter over quarter. We believe it is important
to clearly distinguish how these items affect each period and therefore show adjusted performance measures.
The items affecting comparability are also consistent with how management reviews and evaluates the business
and consequently the information is also included in the operating segments’ disclosures in notes to the
Financial Statements.

The table below sets out the categories of items affecting comparability of the Assemblin Financing Group’s
and the Assemblin Group’s results of operations during periods under review:

financial information from two different groups (the Assemblin Financing Group and the Assemblin Group, which were not under common control during
the periods aggregated) and, consequently, the aggregated amounts may not represent, and are not intended to represent, the results that would have been
achieved if the companies were under common control during relevant periods. In this table, for each line item we reconcile the relevant IFRS measure for
the Assemblin Financing Group and the Assemblin Group to the 2023 Aggregated Total column. This information has been prepared for illustrative
purposes only, is not necessarily representative of the results of operations, cash flows or financial position for any future period at any future date, and is

###### Description of Key Line Items

Set forth below is a brief description of our key line items from our statement of profit or loss and other
comprehensive income.

_Net revenue consists primarily of revenue from construction contracts and service assignments._

- For our construction contracts, revenue from ongoing contracts is recognized over time on the basis of
assignment expenditures incurred in relation to the total estimated assignment fees of the assignment.
Costs associated with this are recognized in earnings as they arise. Revenue is based on a contractual
fixed price or for IPD contracts on a pre-agreed threshold where the margin added changes. Changes in
the scope of the assignment, claims and incentive remuneration are included in project revenue to the
extent that they are agreed upon with the customer and can be reliably measured. A fundamental

132


-----

condition for reporting revenue over time is that the course of events can reasonably be measured against
completion of the performance obligation. For projects in which the outcome of a performance
obligation cannot reasonably be measured, but coverage is expected for the expenditures that arise from
completing the performance obligation, only revenue for expenditures incurred up until the result of the
performance obligation can reasonably be measured is reported.

- For our service assignments, revenue and the appurtenant costs are recognized over time (meaning, in
pace with the service being provided to the customer). Measurement of the course of events is established
on the basis of assignment expenditures incurred in relation to the total estimated assignment
expenditures.

For further information on our revenue recognition policy, see Note 1 to the Audited Consolidated Financial
Statements.

_Cost for production primarily consist of (i) personnel costs, including wages, bonuses and social security costs,_
(ii) raw materials and consumables costs, (iii) subcontractors and purchased services costs, and (iv) premises
directly linked to production, such as warehouses or workshops. In the 2023 Aggregated Total and the three
months ended March 31, 2024, personnel costs accounted for the largest proportion of cost for production.

_Sales and administrative expenses_ primarily consist of personnel expenses in connection with the general
management of our business, including wages, bonuses and social security costs, rental costs for our premises
and other overhead costs as well as non-billable white-collar time.

_Financial income consists of interest income on invested funds, dividend income, and gains on changes in value_
of financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss. Dividend income is recognized when the right
to receive dividends has been established.

_Financial expenses_ consist of interest charged on loans, and the effect of unwinding the present value of
provisions, as well as negative foreign exchange fluctuations on unhedged debt.

_Net financial items consist of net financial income and expense and net foreign exchange gains and foreign_
exchange losses.

_Tax consists of current tax (comprising income taxes in each country where we operate) and deferred tax._

###### Results of Operations

The table below sets forth selected information from the unaudited condensed statement of profit or loss and
other comprehensive income of the Assemblin Group for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and of the

###### Net revenue

Net revenue decreased by SEK 78 million, or 2.1 per cent., from SEK 3,654 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2023 for the Assemblin Financing Group to SEK 3,576 million for the three months ended March
31, 2024 for the Assemblin Group, driven primarily by a decrease in revenues in Assemblin Finland due to
closure of certain projects operations in Helsinki and a slowdown in the geothermal heat-pump market, which
makes up a large portion of certain Finnish operations such as those through Tom Allen Senera, along with all
segments affected by there being less working days in the first quarter of 2024 due to the timing of Easter.

###### Assemblin Electrical Segment

Net revenue of the Assemblin Electrical segment increased by 7.9 per cent., from SEK 1,326 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2023 for the Assemblin Financing Group to SEK 1,431 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2024 for the Assemblin Group. Order intake increased from SEK 1,181 million for
the three months ended March 31, 2023 for the Assemblin Financing Group to SEK 1,484 million for the three

ended March 31, 2024 for the Assemblin Group. Order intake decreased from SEK 420 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2023 for the Assemblin Financing Group to SEK 366 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2024 for the Assemblin Group. Order backlog as of March 31, 2024 decreased to SEK 1,401
million for the Assemblin Financing Group, compared to SEK 1,522 million as of March 31, 2023 for the
Assemblin Group.

###### Assemblin Norway Segment

ended March 31, 2023 for the Assemblin Financing Group to SEK 2,812 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2024 for the Assemblin Group, driven by decreased revenue generating activities and therefore less
wages, personnel and raw materials expenditure.

###### Sales and administrative expenses

Sales and administrative expenses increased by SEK 145 million, or 26.8 per cent. from SEK 541 million for
the three months ended March 31, 2023 for the Assemblin Financing Group to SEK 686 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2024 for the Assemblin Group, driven by higher amortization expenses on intangible
PPA assets recognized following the initial consolidation as a result of the Assemblin Financing Acquisition.

135


-----

###### Operating profit

Operating profit decreased by SEK 141 million, or 64.4 per cent., from SEK 219 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2023 for the Assemblin Financing Group to SEK 78 million for the three months ended March
31, 2024 for the Assemblin Group, driven by higher amortization charges on intangible PPA assets recognized
following the initial consolidation as a result of the Assemblin Financing Acquisition.

###### Net financial items

Net financial items increased by SEK 87 million, or 85.3 per cent., from negative SEK 102 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2023 for the Assemblin Financing Group to negative SEK 189 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2024 for the Assemblin Group. The increase in net financial items was attributable to
the issuance of bonds in July 2023 and adverse foreign exchange effects.

###### Income taxes

Income taxes amounted to negative SEK 29 million for the Assemblin Financing Group and positive SEK 28
million for the Assemblin Group in the three months ended March 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively,
corresponding to 24.8 per cent. and 25.0 per cent. of profit before tax of SEK 117 million for the Assemblin
Financing Group and negative SEK 112 million for the Assemblin Group for the respective periods.

###### Profit/loss for the period

months ended March 31, 2023 for the Assemblin Financing Group to negative SEK 84 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2024 for the Assemblin Group, as a result of the factors described above.

Our Assemblin Adjusted EBITA for the period increased from SEK 241 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2023 for the Assemblin Financing Group to SEK 248 million for the three months ended March 31,
2024 for the Assemblin Group, which is an increase of 2.9 per cent., while Assemblin Adjusted EBITA Margin
was 6.6 per cent. for the Assemblin Financing Group and 6.9 per cent. for the Assemblin Group in the respective
periods.

Assemblin Adjusted EBITA for the Assemblin Electrical segment increased by 17.8 per cent from SEK 101
million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 for the Assemblin Financing Group to SEK 119 million for
the three months ended March 31, 2024 for the Assemblin Group, while the Assemblin Adjusted EBITA Margin
was 7.6 per cent. for the Assemblin Financing Group and 8.3 per cent. for the Assemblin Group in the respective
periods.

for the three months ended March 31, 2023 for the Assemblin Financing Group to SEK 70 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2024 for the Assemblin Group, while the Assemblin Adjusted EBITA Margin
increased from 6.8 per cent. for the Assemblin Financing Group to 7.9 per cent. for the Assemblin Group over
the same period.

million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 for the Assemblin Financing Group to SEK 16 million for
the three months ended March 31, 2024 for the Assemblin Group, while Assemblin Adjusted EBITA Margin
decreased from 5.4 per cent. for the Assemblin Financing Group to 4.0 per cent. for the Assemblin Group over
the same period, primarily driven by there being less working days in the first quarter of 2024 due to the timing
of Easter.

In the Assemblin Norway segment, Assemblin Adjusted EBITA decreased by 39.4 per cent. from SEK 33
million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 for the Assemblin Financing Group to SEK 20 million for

also decreased from 6.2 per cent. for the Assemblin Financing Group to 4.0 per cent. for the Assemblin Group
over the same period, primarily driven by there being less working days in the first quarter of 2024 due to the
timing of Easter and restructuring of certain operations and smaller units.

In the Assemblin Finland segment, Assemblin Adjusted EBITA decreased from SEK 24 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2023 for the Assemblin Financing Group to SEK 18 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2024 for the Assemblin Group. However, Assemblin Adjusted EBITA Margin increased from
4.2 per cent. for the Assemblin Financing Group to 4.3 per cent. for the Assemblin Financing Group over the
same period.

###### 2023 Aggregated Total Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2022 for the Assemblin Financing Group

The 2023 Aggregated Total is comprised of unaudited results for the Assemblin Financing Group for the fourmonth period ended May 2, 2023 and audited results for the Assemblin Group for the eight-month period ended
December 31, 2023 (commencing May 2, 2023). See “Presentation of Financial Information and Other Data.”
These periods are not directly comparable as they represent levels of consolidation under different entities that
were not under common control across the periods. The 2023 Aggregated Total Financial Information is not
prepared pursuant to IFRS since it is an aggregation of consolidated financial information from two different
groups (the Assemblin Financing Group and the Assemblin Group, which were not under common control
during the periods aggregated) and, consequently, the aggregated amounts may not represent, and are not
intended to represent, the results that would have been achieved if the companies were under common control
during relevant periods. The 2023 Aggregated Total Financial Information has not been audited or reviewed by
our independent auditors or any third party. The 2023 Aggregated Total Financial Information is presented for
informational purposes only. It does not represent a full annual period, or the results that would have been
achieved if the entities were under common control during the period of time, and is presented solely to assist
prospective investors in assessing the comparability of the results of operations for the financial year ended
December 31, 2023 with the periods prior to the change in scope of consolidation.

(3) Figures are from the audited consolidated financial statements of the Assemblin Group as of and for the eight-month period ended December 31, 2023.

(4) The information in the 2023 Aggregated Total column has not been prepared pursuant to IFRS as the figures therein are aggregations of consolidated financial
information from two different groups (the Assemblin Financing Group and the Assemblin Group, which were not under common control during the periods
aggregated) and, consequently, the aggregated amounts may not represent, and are not intended to represent, the results that would have been achieved if the
companies were under common control during relevant periods. In this table, for each line item we reconcile the relevant IFRS measure for the Assemblin
Financing Group and the Assemblin Group to the 2023 Aggregated Total column. This information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only, is not
necessarily representative of the results of operations, cash flows or financial position for any future period at any future date, and is not prepared in the ordinary
course of Assemblin’s financial reporting.

###### Net revenue

Net revenue increased by SEK 1,230 million, or 9.1 per cent., from SEK 13,521 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022 to SEK 14,751 million for the 2023 Aggregated Total (comprised of SEK 4,835 million for
the Assemblin Financing Group for the four-month period ended May 2, 2023 and SEK 9,915 million for the
Assemblin Group for the eight-month period ended December 31, 2023). Of the total growth, 3.8 per cent. is
attributable to organic growth and the remainder was due to acquisition growth (5.0 per cent.) and to currency
effects growth (0.3 per cent.). Organic growth was driven primarily by inflationary growth in the beginning of
the year, a strong geothermal market in Finland which led to increased sales in the region and higher sales in
Sweden and Norway later in the year. Net revenue from service assignments and contractor assignment
operations increased by 9.1 per cent. to SEK 6,127 million (comprised of SEK 2,031 million for the Assemblin
Financing Group for the four-month period ended May 2, 2023 and SEK 4,096 million for the Assemblin Group
for the eight-month period ended December 31, 2023) from SEK 5,616 million and 9.1 per cent. to SEK 8,623
million (comprised of SEK 2,804 million for the Assemblin Financing Group for the four-month period ended
May 2, 2023 and SEK 5,819 million for the Assemblin Group for the eight-month period ended December 31,
2023) from SEK 7,905 million, respectively, for the 2023 Aggregated Total compared to the year ended
December 31, 2022. Order intake for the period increased 9.6% per cent. period-on-period to SEK 14,425
million for the 2023 Aggregated Total (comprised of SEK 4,397 million for the Assemblin Financing Group for
the four-month period ended May 2, 2023 and SEK 10,028 million for the Assemblin Group for the eight-month
period ended December 31, 2023), compared to SEK 13,167 million during the year ended December 31, 2022,
driven in particular by somewhat more large to mid-size orders compared to the previous period. The large
order intake meant that order backlog as of December 31, 2023 was SEK 9,297 million, compared to SEK 9,535
million as of December 31, 2022, declining slightly due an increased share of order backlog related to larger
projects.

###### Assemblin Electrical Segment

Net revenue of the Assemblin Electrical segment for the period increased by 10.7 per cent., from SEK 4,894
million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to SEK 5,415 million for the 2023 Aggregated Total (comprised
of SEK 1,739 million for the Assemblin Financing Group for the four-month period ended May 2, 2023 and
SEK 3,676 million for the Assemblin Group for the eight-month period ended December 31, 2023), driven
primarily by organic growth and previously completed acquisitions. Order intake increased from SEK 4,336
million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to SEK 5,682 million for the 2023 Aggregated Total (comprised
of SEK 1,638 million for the Financing Group for the four-month period ended May 2, 2023 and SEK 4,044
million for the Assemblin Group for the eight-month period ended December 31, 2023). As of December 31,
2023, order backlog amounted to SEK 3,561 million compared to SEK 3,028 million as of December 31, 2022.

###### Assemblin H&S

Net revenue of the Assemblin H&S segment increased by 10.3 per cent., from SEK 3,266 million for the year
ended December 31, 2022 to SEK 3,603 million for the 2023 Aggregated Total (comprised of SEK 1,196 million
for the Assemblin Financing Group for the four-month period ended May 2, 2023 and SEK 2,407 million for
the Assemblin Group for the eight-month period ended December 31, 2023), driven primarily by organic growth
and previously completed acquisitions. Order intake increased from SEK 3,502 million for the year ended

December 31, 2022 to SEK 3,573 million for the 2023 Aggregated Total (comprised of SEK 1,104 million for
the Assemblin Financing Group for the four-month period ended May 2, 2023 and SEK 2,469 million for the
Assemblin Group for the eight-month period ended December 31, 2023). Order backlog as of December 31,
2023 decreased to SEK 2,089 million, compared to SEK 2,149 million as of December 31, 2022.

###### Assemblin Ventilation Segment

Net revenue of the Assemblin Ventilation segment decreased by 2.1 per cent., from SEK 1,617 million for the
year ended December 31, 2022 to SEK 1,583 million for the 2023 Aggregated Total (comprised of SEK 530
million for the Assemblin Financing Group for the four-month period ended May 2, 2023 and SEK 1,053
million for the Assemblin Group for the eight-month period ended December 31, 2023), driven primarily by
slightly lower project production. Order intake increased from SEK 1,454 million for the year ended December
31, 2022 to SEK 1,473 million for the 2023 Aggregated Total (comprised of SEK 501 million for the Assemblin
Financing Group for the four-month period ended May 2, 2023 and SEK 972 million for the Assemblin Group
for the eight-month period ended December 31, 2023). Order backlog as of December 31, 2023 decreased to
SEK 1,428 million, compared to SEK 1,490 million as of December 31, 2022.

###### Assemblin Norway Segment

Net revenue of the Assemblin Norway segment increased by 7.9 per cent., from SEK 2,038 million for the year
ended December 31, 2022 to SEK 2,202 million for the 2023 Aggregated Total (comprised of SEK 679 million
for the Assemblin Financing Group for the four-month period ended May 2, 2023 and SEK 1,523 million for
the Assemblin Group for the eight-month period ended December 31, 2023), driven primarily by organic growth
and previously completed acquisitions. Order intake increased from SEK 1,861 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022 to SEK 2,222 million for the 2023 Aggregated Total (comprised of SEK 654 million for
the Assemblin Financing Group for the four-month period ended May 2, 2023 and SEK 1,568 million for the
Assemblin Group for the eight-month period ended December 31, 2023).Order backlog as of December 31,
2023 decreased to SEK 1,716 million, compared to SEK 1,763 million as of December 31, 2022.

###### Assemblin Finland Segment

Net revenue of the Assemblin Finland segment increased by 14.8 per cent., from SEK 1,895 million for the year
ended December 31, 2022 to SEK 2,175 million for the 2023 Aggregated Total (comprised of SEK 758 million
for the Assemblin Financing Group for the four-month period ended May 2, 2023 and SEK 1,417 million for
the Assemblin Group for the eight-month period ended December 31, 2023), driven primarily by organic growth
and previously completed acquisitions. Order intake decreased from SEK 2,014 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022 to SEK 1,579 million for the 2023 Aggregated Total (comprised of SEK 523 million for
the Assemblin Financing Group for the four-month period ended May 2, 2023 and SEK 1,056 million for the
Assemblin Group for the eight-month period ended December 31, 2023). Order backlog as of December 31,
2023 decreased to SEK 504 million, compared to SEK 1,105 million as of December 31, 2022.

###### Cost for production

Cost for production increased by SEK 802 million, or 7.4 per cent., from SEK 10,794 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022 to SEK 11,596 million for the 2023 Aggregated Total (comprised of SEK 3,807 million for
the Assemblin Financing Group for the four-month period ended May 2, 2023 and SEK 7,789 million for the
Assemblin Group for the eight-month period ended December 31, 2023), driven by decreased revenue
generating activities and therefore less wages, personnel and raw materials expenditure.

###### Sales and administrative expenses

Sales and administrative expenses increased by SEK 730 million, or 38.6 per cent. From SEK 1,893 million for
the year ended December 31, 2022 to SEK 2,623 million for the 2023 Aggregated Total (comprised of SEK 738
million for the Assemblin Financing Group for the four-month period ended May 2, 2023 and SEK 1,885

141


-----

million for the Assemblin Group for the eight-month period ended December 31, 2023), driven by higher
amortization charges on intangible PPA assets recognized following initial consolidation as a result of the
Assemblin Financing Acquisition.

###### Operating profit

Operating profit decreased by SEK 236 million, or 26.5 per cent., from SEK 889 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022 to SEK 653 million for the 2023 Aggregated Total (comprised of SEK 291 million for the
Assemblin Financing Group for the four-month period ended May 2, 2023 and SEK 362 million for the
Assemblin Group for the eight-month period ended December 31, 2023) due to higher amortization charges on
intangible PPA assets recognized following initial consolidation as a result of the Assemblin Financing
Acquisition.

###### Net financial items

Net financial items increased by SEK 256 million, or 69.8 per cent., from negative SEK 367 million for the
year ended December 31, 2022 to negative SEK 623 million for the 2023 Aggregated Total (comprised of
negative SEK 139 million for the Assemblin Financing Group for the four-month period ended May 2, 2023
and negative SEK 484 million for the Assemblin Group for the eight-month period ended December 31, 2023).
The change in net financial items and other financial expenses was mainly attributable to issuance of bonds in
July 2023 and adverse foreign exchange effects.

###### Income taxes

Income taxes amounted to SEK 132 million and SEK 44 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 and the
2023 Aggregated Total (comprised of SEK 39 million for the Assemblin Financing Group for the four-month
period ended May 2, 2023 and SEK 5 million for the Assemblin Group for the eight-month period ended
December 31, 2023), respectively, corresponding to 25.3 per cent. and 146.7 per cent. of profit before tax of
SEK 522 million and SEK 30 million (comprised of SEK 151 million for the Assemblin Financing Group for
the four-month period ended May 2, 2023 and negative SEK 121 million for the Assemblin Group for the eightmonth period ended December 31, 2023) for the respective periods.

###### Profit/loss for the period

Profit/loss for the year decreased by SEK 404 million from SEK 390 million for the year ended December 31,
2022 to negative SEK 14 million for the 2023 Aggregated Total (comprised of SEK 113 million for the
Assemblin Financing Group for the four-month period ended May 2, 2023 and negative SEK 127 million for
the Assemblin Group for the eight-month period ended December 31, 2023), due to the factors described above.

###### Adjusted EBITA and margins

Our Assemblin Adjusted EBITA for the period increased from SEK 940 million for the year ended December
31, 2022 to SEK 1,059 million for the 2023 Aggregated Total (comprised of SEK 320 million for the Assemblin
Financing Group for the four-month period ended May 2, 2023 and SEK 738 million for the Assemblin Group
for the eight-month period ended December 31, 2023), which is an increase of 12.7 per cent., while Assemblin
Adjusted EBITA Margin was 7.0 per cent. and 7.2 per cent. in the respective periods. Earnings and profitability
for the period improved in all business areas. Additionally, although Assemblin Finland had an increase in
Adjusted EBITDA, it experienced both a weak start and a weak end to the year due to year-to-year revenue
volatility as a result of a drop in demand within the geo-thermal market and certain parts of the Finnish business
being restructured. Measures to enhance profitability have been initiated to reverse the trend.

Assemblin Adjusted EBITA for the Assemblin Electrical segment increased by 20.5 per cent. from SEK 347
million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to SEK 418 million for the 2023 Aggregated Total (comprised
of SEK 127 million for the Assemblin Financing Group for the four-month period ended May 2, 2023 and SEK
291 million for the Assemblin Group for the eight-month period ended December 31, 2023) while the Assemblin

142


-----

Adjusted EBITA Margin also improved from 7.1 per cent. to 7.8 per cent. over the same period, driven by
organic and acquired growth.

For the Assemblin H&S segment, Assemblin Adjusted EBITA increased by 2.7 per cent. from SEK 256 million
for the year ended December 31, 2022 to SEK 263 million for the 2023 Aggregated Total (comprised of SEK
82 million for the Assemblin Financing Group for the four-month period ended May 2, 2023 and SEK 181
million for the Assemblin Group for the eight-month period ended December 31, 2023) while the Assemblin
Adjusted EBITA Margin deteriorated from 7.8 per cent. to 7.3 per cent. over the same period, partly due to
decreased profitability in some locations, although overall maintaining a strong level of profitability in others.

Assemblin Adjusted EBITA for the Assemblin Ventilation segment decreased by 8.6 per cent. from SEK 105
million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to SEK 96 million for the 2023 Aggregated Total (comprised of
SEK 29 million for the Assemblin Financing Group for the four-month period ended May 2, 2023 and SEK 67
million for the Assemblin Group for the eight-month period ended December 31, 2023) while Assemblin
Adjusted EBITA Margin also deteriorated from 6.5 per cent. to 6.1 per cent over the same period, due to lower
production on some larger projects.

In the Assemblin Norway segment, Assemblin Adjusted EBITA increased by 5.9 per cent. from SEK 170 million
for the year ended December 31, 2022 to SEK 180 million for the 2023 Aggregated Total (comprised of SEK
39 million for the Assemblin Financing Group for the four-month period ended May 2, 2023 and SEK 141
million for the Assemblin Group for the eight-month period ended December 31, 2023) while Assemblin
Adjusted EBITA Margin remained largely flat from 8.3 per cent. to 8.2 per cent. over the same period, due to
strong production in the fourth quarter of 2023, and strength in large units offsetting some regional weaknesses.

Assemblin Adjusted EBITA for the Assemblin Finland segment increased by 105.4 per cent. from SEK 37
million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to SEK 76 million for the 2023 Aggregated Total (comprised of
SEK 34 million for the Assemblin Financing Group for the four-month period ended May 2, 2023 and SEK 42
million for the Assemblin Group for the eight-month period ended December 31, 2023) while the Assemblin
Adjusted EBITA Margin improved from 1.9 per cent. to 3.5 per cent. over the same period, mainly due to strong
building management systems and geothermal performance offsetting restructuring and project write-downs in
projects operations in Helsinki.

###### Net revenue

Net revenue increased by SEK 2,800 million, or 26.1 per cent., from SEK 10,721 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021 to SEK 13,521 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Of the total growth, 12.6 per
cent. is attributable to organic growth and the remainder was due to acquisition growth (12.2 per cent.) and to
currency effects growth (1.3 per cent.). Organic growth was driven primarily by services resuming after the
COVID-19 pandemic, a decrease in the headwinds from restructuring experienced in 2021 and the pass through
of inflationary increases in the price of goods and services. Norway showed the strongest organic growth with
service growth particularly high. Inorganic revenue growth primarily in Finland driven by the acquisitions of
Fidelix and Tom Allen Senera. Net revenue from service assignments and contractor assignment operations
increased by 27.8 per cent. to SEK 5,616 million from SEK 4,394 million and 25.0 per cent. to SEK 7,905
million from SEK 6,326 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2022 from the same period in
the prior year. Order intake for the period increased 17.0 per cent. period-on-period to SEK 13,167 million for
the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to SEK 11,258 million during the year ended December 31, 2021,
driven in particular by a continued strong market, especially in GreenTech, and inflationary effects. The large
order intake meant that order backlog as of December 31, 2022 had reached a record high of SEK 9,535 million,
compared to SEK 9,370 million as of December 31, 2021.

year ended December 31, 2021 to negative SEK 367 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The change

million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to SEK 347 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 while
the Assemblin Adjusted EBITA Margin also improved from 6.5 per cent. to 7.1 per cent. over the same period,
driven by previously implemented profitability improvements and profitable acquisitions.

Assemblin Adjusted EBITA Margin also increased from 6.2 per cent. to 6.5 per cent over the same period, due
to organic growth and continued focus on the operational improvements.

In the Assemblin Norway segment, Assemblin Adjusted EBITA increased by 25.9 per cent. from SEK 135
million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to SEK 170 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 while

million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to SEK 37 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 while
the Assemblin Adjusted EBITA Margin decreased from 5.6 per cent. and 1.9 per cent. over the same period,

Adjusted EBITA divided by net revenue for the period, expressed as a percentage. Assemblin EBITA and Assemblin Adjusted EBITA of individual segments are presented before intragroup eliminations. Please see “Summary
_Consolidated Financial and Other Information” and the F-pages for details and reconciliation to the nearest IFRS measure._

###### Liquidity and Capital Resources

“Liquidity” describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flow to meet the cash requirements of
its business operations, including but not limited to working capital needs, capital expenditures, debt service
obligations, contractual obligations and acquisitions. Our primary uses of liquidity are to meet our debt service
obligations, to fund capital expenditures and selected bolt-on acquisitions and to fund changes in working capital.
Our primary sources of liquidity are provided by cash generated from our operating activities, our leasing
facilities which we utilize primarily to fund vehicle purchases, and further supplemented by amounts drawn
under the Revolving Credit Facility. We expect to draw on the Revolving Credit Facility to service our working
capital needs and for other general corporate purposes. Borrowings and availability under the Revolving Credit
Facility will be subject to certain conditions precedent, including compliance with financial maintenance and
other covenants and representations and warranties. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—The
_Super Senior Facilities.”_

Although we believe that our expected cash flow from operating activities will be adequate to meet our expected
liquidity needs, including our debt service obligations, we cannot assure you that our business will generate
sufficient cash flow from operations to meet these needs or that future debt or equity financing will be available
to us in an amount sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including making payments on the Notes or on our
other debt when due. If our cash flow from operating activities is lower than expected, we may be required to
seek additional financing, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Our ability to
arrange financing generally and our cost of capital depend on numerous factors, including general economic
conditions, the availability of credit from banks, other financial institutions and capital markets, restrictions in
the instruments governing our debt and our general financial performance. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to
_Our Financial Profile—Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations may make it difficult for us to_
_fulfill our obligations under the Notes and operate our business”_ and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
_Financial Profile—We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, including due to_
_factors outside our control, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our_
_indebtedness, which may not be successful.”_

###### Cash Flow

The table below sets forth our consolidated cash flow statement for the three months ended March 31, 2024 for
the Assemblin Group, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 for the Assemblin Financing Group, for the
2023 Aggregated Total and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 for the Assemblin Financing Group.
These periods are not directly comparable as they represent levels of consolidation under different entities that
were not under common control across the periods. The 2023 Aggregated Total Financial Information is not
prepared pursuant to IFRS since it is an aggregation of consolidated financial information from two different
groups (the Assemblin Financing Group and the Assemblin Group, which were not under common control during
the periods aggregated) and, consequently, the aggregated amounts may not represent, and are not intended to
represent, the results that would have been achieved if the companies were under common control during relevant
periods. The 2023 Aggregated Total Financial Information has not been audited or reviewed by our independent
auditors or any third party. The 2023 Aggregated Total Financial Information is presented for informational
purposes only. It does not represent a full annual period, or the results that would have been achieved if the
entities were under common control during the period of time, and is presented solely to assist prospective
investors in assessing the comparability of the results of operations for the financial year ended December 31,
2023 with the periods prior to the change in scope of consolidation.

Notes:

(1) Figures are from the audited consolidated financial statements of the Assemblin Financing Group for the years ended December 31, 2022 and
2021.

(2) Figures are from the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial information of the Assemblin Financing Group as of and for the four-month
period ended May 2, 2023.

(3) Figures are from the audited consolidated financial statements of the Assemblin Group as of and for the eight-month period ended December 31, 2023.

(4) The information in the 2023 Aggregated Total and the Aggregated LTM Total columns has not been prepared pursuant to IFRS as the figures therein are
aggregations of consolidated financial information from two different groups (the Assemblin Financing Group and the Assemblin Group, which were
not under common control during the periods aggregated) and, consequently, the aggregated amounts may not represent, and are not intended to represent,
the results that would have been achieved if the companies were under common control during relevant periods. In this table, for each line item we
reconcile the relevant IFRS measure for the Assemblin Financing Group and the Assemblin Group to the 2023 Aggregated Total and the Aggregated
LTM Total columns, as applicable. This information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only, is not necessarily representative of the results of
operations, cash flows or financial position for any future period at any future date, and is not prepared in the ordinary course of Assemblin’s financial
reporting.

(5) Figures are from the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Assemblin Financing Group as of and for the three months
ended March 31, 2023.

(6) Figures are from the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Assemblin Group as of and for the three months ended March
31, 2024.

(7) For the 2023 Aggregated Total, the relevant figures are not the aggregate of the information from the four-month period ended May 2, 2023, for the
Assemblin Financing Group and the eight-month period ended December 31, 2023, for the Assemblin Group. A cash and cash equivalents balance of
SEK 407 million existed at May 2, 2023, and there were effects of exchange rate fluctuations totaling SEK 4 million, which would not be factored into
a simple aggregate. Consequently, adjustments of SEK 411 million have been made for the initial balance and the effects of exchange rate fluctuations
for accuracy, and these are reflected in the 2023 Aggregated Total and the Aggregated LTM Total.

###### Cash Flow from Operating Activities

Cash inflow from operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 increased by SEK 66 million
from SEK 241 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 for the Assemblin Financing Group to SEK
###### 307 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 for the Assemblin Group, primarily as a result of
decreased working capital.

Cash inflow from operating activities for the 2023 Aggregated Total increased by SEK 272 million, or 55.9 per
cent., from SEK 487 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 for the Assemblin Financing Group to SEK
###### 759 million for the 2023 Aggregated Total (comprised of SEK 251 million for the Assemblin Financing Group
for the four-month period ended May 2, 2023 and SEK 508 million for the Assemblin Group for the eight-month
period ended December 31, 2023), primarily as a result of decreased working capital.

156


-----

Cash inflow from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 for the Assemblin Financing Group
decreased by SEK 132 million, or 21.3 per cent., from SEK 619 million for the year ended December 31, 2021
for the Assemblin Financing Group to SEK 487 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to
increased working capital.

###### Cash Flow from Investing Activities

Cash outflow from investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 decreased by SEK 260 million,
from an outflow of SEK 23 million for the three months ended March 21, 2023 for the Assemblin Financing
Group to an outflow of SEK 283 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 for the Assemblin Group,
primarily due to acquisitions of subsidiaries in the first quarter of 2023.

Cash outflow from investing activities for the 2023 Aggregated Total increased by SEK 209 million, from an
outflow of SEK 369 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 for the Assemblin Financing Group to an
outflow of SEK 578 million for the 2023 Aggregated Total (comprised of negative SEK 302 million for the
Assemblin Financing Group for the four-month period ended May 2, 2023 and SEK 135 million for the
Assemblin Group for the eight-month period ended December 31, 2023), primarily due to acquisitions of
subsidiaries in 2023. For the 2023 Aggregated Total, the figures are not the aggregate of the information from
the four-month period ended May 2, 2023, for the Assemblin Financing Group and the eight-month period ended
December 31, 2023, for the Assemblin Group. A cash and cash equivalents balance of SEK 407 million existed
at May 2, 2023, and there were effects of exchange rate fluctuations totaling SEK 4 million, which would not be
factored into a simple aggregate. Consequently, adjustments of SEK 411 million have been made for the initial
balance and the effects of exchange rate fluctuations for accuracy, and these are reflected in the 2023 Aggregated
Total.

Cash outflow from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased by SEK 1,169 million,
from an outflow of SEK 1,538 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 for the Assemblin Financing Group
to an outflow of SEK 369 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 for the Assemblin Financing Group,
primarily due to the smaller size of acquisitions made in the period.

###### Cash Flow from Financing Activities

Cash flow from financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 were an outflow of
SEK 69 million for the Assemblin Group and SEK 60 million for the Assemblin Financing Group, respectively,
primarily due to amortization lease debts.

Cash flow from financing activities for the 2023 Aggregated Total was an outflow of SEK 134 million
(comprised of negative SEK 79 million for the Assemblin Financing Group for the four-month period ended May
2, 2023 and negative SEK 54 million for the Assemblin Group for the eight-month period ended December 31,
2023), primarily due to amortization of lease debts and the refinancing transaction completed in the third quarter
of 2023.

Cash flow from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 for the Assemblin Financing Group
was an outflow of SEK 220 million, primarily due to repayments on leases.

Cash flow from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 for the Assemblin Financing Group
was an inflow of SEK 839 million, primarily due to new financing from additional bond issuance and shareholder
contributions.

###### Working Capital Requirements

We do not currently have significant short-term or long-term working capital requirements, because we typically
receive payments under our installation contracts prior to paying costs related thereto. These prepayment
arrangements, along with personnel-related costs (primarily vacation salary), result in our negative working
capital position for installation projects. In our services contracts, Net Working Capital requirements are
generally positive, as these rely less on subcontractors and materials purchased, and feature higher costs related
to our own personnel. Customer invoices are typically not drawn until work has been completed.

157

Our working capital requirements are also seasonal. See “—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—
_Seasonality.”_

###### Pensions obligations

Some of our white-collar employees in Sweden are covered by a defined benefit pension plan, which is accounted
for in accordance with IAS 19 under which we are required to provide agreed benefits to current and former
employees. Other employees have pensions that are recognized as defined-contribution.

As of December 31, 2023, approximately 26.3 per cent. of our employees had defined benefit pensions. Of these,
the Swedish plan for electricity white-collar employees is recognized as defined-benefit for purposes of our
financial statements, and is unfunded and based on final salary, which provides employees with benefits in the
form of a guaranteed level of pension disbursements over their lifetimes. For the remaining white-collar
employees in Sweden the defined-benefit pension obligations are secured through insurance with Alecta. Alecta
does not provide access to information that would make it possible for us to recognize this plan as a definedbenefit plan. The pension plan secured through insurance with Alecta is therefore recognized as a definedcontribution plan. Annual fees for pension insurance contracted with Alecta totaled SEK 83.8 million (comprised
of SEK 27.4 million for the Assemblin Financing Group for the four-month period ended May 2, 2023 and SEK
56.4 million for the Assemblin Group for the eight-month period ended December 31, 2023), SEK 74.2 million
and SEK 68.8 million, in the 2023 Aggregated Total and the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively. Alecta’s surplus can be allocated to policy holders and/or the insured.

Pension scheme liabilities vary with changes to long-term interest rates, inflation, pensionable salaries and the
longevity of scheme members. During the periods under review, liabilities in respect of provisions for pensions
decreased from SEK 788 million as of December 31, 2021 to SEK 548 million as of December 31, 2022 for the

158


-----

Assemblin Financing Group, but increased to SEK 644 million for the 2023 Aggregated Total before increasing
to SEK 678 million as of March 31, 2024 for the Assemblin Group, with changes driven primarily by a decline
in market interest rates in 2021, followed by increases in 2022 and a slight decrease in 2023, which resulted in
the assumed discount rate for defined-benefit obligations increasing from 1.80 per cent. as of December 31, 2021
to 4.00 per cent. as of December 31, 2022 and to 3.30 per cent. as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024,
respectively. The increases from time to time in liabilities in respect of provisions for pensions also reflects the
relatively greater proportion of plan participants that are not eligible for retirement, as compared to the number
of former plan participants that have retired.

See Note 8 to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further information as to our pensions
obligations and pensions costs.

In accordance with the requirements of the pension administrator, we are required to provide bank guarantees in
respect of a portion of the Assemblin Group’s defined-benefit pensions obligations. In January 2024, we were
required to increase the amount of our SEK 375 million bank guarantee to SEK 410 million, of which SEK 320
million is incurred under the Pension Guarantee Facility and SEK 90 million is incurred under the Guarantee
Facility. As of March 31, 2024, we had outstanding bank guarantees in favor of the pension administrator
amounting to SEK 410 million (of which SEK 320 million is incurred under the Pension Guarantee Facility and
SEK 90 million is incurred under the Guarantee Facility). Our obligations with respect to (i) the Pension
Guarantee Facility are secured on the Collateral on a super super senior basis to the Notes and (ii) the Guarantee
Facility are secured on the Collateral on a super senior basis to the Notes. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—The Super Senior Facilities.” Availability of the additional guarantee amounts under the_
Pensions Guarantee Facility or the Guarantee Facility, however, is subject to certain conditions, including
compliance with certain financial covenants.

###### Contractual commitments and contingencies

Our contractual commitments comprise primarily our contractual obligations to perform work invoiced, but not
yet completed and warranty commitments, which related to assumed expenditures in the future for rectifying
errors and shortcomings regarding concluded projects that arise during the warranty period for the projects. See
Notes 25 and 26 to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding provisions
related to these liabilities.

In connection with our operations, we are required to provide a certain number of commitments in terms of
performance guarantees for completion of work, guarantees of customer advances and parent company
guarantees. As of March 31, 2024, we estimate that performance guarantees amounted to approximately SEK
384 million, approximately SEK 35 million was provided under the Guarantee Facility, with the remainder
provided principally by insurance companies on an unsecured basis, as well as commercial banks.

Additional variable cash consideration of up to SEK 401 million related to earnout provisions in our acquisition
agreements and SEK 3 million related to deferred consideration was payable over the next three years as of
March 31, 2024.

###### Risk Management

We are exposed to various types of risks, both operational and financial. Operational risks are associated with
day-to-day operations relating to economic activity, tendering, capacity utilization, price risks and revenue
recognition. Financial risks arise from the amount of capital tied up and our capital requirements. We believe we
are exposed to greater operational risks than financial risks.

###### Financial Risk Management

In our installation business risks are asymmetric. In any given project, the chances of exceeding the expected
outcome during the term of the project are limited while there is a risk of incurring significant losses in relation
to the size of the project. The management of operational risks is a continuous process covering a large number
of ongoing projects and service assignments. We have designed several methods to ensure that operational risks
remain under control. We believe our systematic work on quality and environmental issues as well as

159


-----

occupational health and safety issues are key building blocks that underpin our management systems. Our
financial risks are managed centrally for the purpose of minimizing and controlling our risk exposure while credit
risks are managed locally at each of our profit centers.

###### Operational Risks

 Economic Activity

Fluctuations in the economy affect the building services sector, which is sensitive to market fluctuations and
political decisions that can have an impact on demand for residential and commercial new builds and investments
in industry and the public sector. Demand for service and maintenance work is less sensitive to fluctuations in
the economy.

###### Tendering

An installation and service company is exposed to commercial and production-related risks, which need to be
identified and managed during the tendering process. To ensure that this is done, we have implemented process
descriptions and checklists that are aimed at identifying and pricing the risks in our cost estimates and tenders.

**Capacity Utilization**

Capacity utilization is heavily dependent on demand in our geographic markets. An unforeseen decline in
capacity utilization generally results in a loss of revenue, which in the short term cannot be offset by a
corresponding cost reduction. We seek to mitigate these risks through continuous resource planning, including
redundancies if order backlog does not support current local staffing levels and by employing subcontractors
during periods of peak production.

###### Price Risks

Unforeseen variations in input prices and prices charged by subcontractors constitute a risk. We seek to offset
the risk of rising prices through the use of contract forms that are appropriate for the project, indexation for fixedprice agreements and efficient purchasing procedures.

###### Insurance

We believe we have adequate insurance coverage for our operations, comprising liability, contract and property
insurance.

###### Internal Controls

Our Boards act as the ultimate source of internal controls. Our Boards have delegated to senior management the
establishment and implementation of a system of internal controls appropriate to our business. These controls
include the safeguarding of assets; the maintenance of proper accounting records; the reliability of financial
information; and compliance with appropriate legislation, regulation and best practice.

Our operations are decentralized and governed based on a shared framework, clear allocation of roles and
responsibilities and systematic monitoring. Our branch managers are continuously supported and monitored at
the regional, business area Group level to ensure appropriate risk managed and improved profitability. This
support is carried out by, among other things, project selection controls and project execution controls.

Management and administration are performed at the branch level by our branch-level managers at
approximately 189 of our local branch offices locations throughout the Nordic region as of March 31, 2024. Our
branch-level managers report to their respective regional manager who in turn reports to the Business Area
manager who together with the CEO, CFO and Head of Communication form senior executive management.
Each of our units consists of, and is responsible for, one or more profit centers. We characterize our profit centers
as either installation profit centers or service profit centers, based on the predominant operations conducted by
the applicable profit center.

In relation to project selection, tenders are approved based on project size, assuming standard contractual terms.
Projects under SEK 10 million can be approved directly by the branch office, with projects between SEK 10

160


-----

million to 20 million and SEK 20 million to SEK 50 million required to be approved at the region and business
area level, respectively. Projects between SEK 50 million to SEK 100 million must be approved at the Group
level and contracts over SEK 100 million are required to be approved by our Board. With respect to project
execution, units are supported by an established system of financial, internal and management controls.

###### Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements

 Recognition of revenue over time

The reported earnings in ongoing contract projects are recognized over time on the basis of assignment
expenditures incurred in relation to the total estimated assignment fees of the assignment. Costs associated with
this are recognized in earnings as they arise. This requires reliable calculation of project revenue and project
costs. The precondition is a properly functioning system for cost accounting, forecasting processes and project
monitoring. The forecast regarding the project’s final outcome is a critical judgement that is material to the
operating report over the course of the project. There may be a risk that the final result as regards the project
could deviate from what is gradually reported.

###### Pensions

We have partial defined-benefit pension plans. The pension obligations are calculated using actuarial
assumptions, and plan assets are marked to market on the balance-sheet date. A change in any of these
assumptions and measurements could have a significant impact on calculated pension commitments and pension
cost.

###### Intangible assets

 Impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets

The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units are based on the assumption of future conditions and estimates
of various parameters. Changes in these assumptions and estimates could have an effect on the carrying amount
of goodwill. A recession in the rate of growth and operating margin would yield a lower recoverable amount.
The reverse applies if the recoverable amount were calculated based on a higher rate of growth or margin. If
future cash flows are discounted at a higher interest rate, the recoverable amount would be lower. The reverse
would apply if the recoverable amount were to rise in conjunction with discounting at a lower discount rate.

###### Warranty provisions

We make warranty provisions are made for the warranty obligations found in the contract assignments being
performed. A warranty expenditure arises in a project when a Group company performs extra work as a result of
shortcomings that emerged in the original contract, in work performed or in materials. A warranty reserve is
calculated based on the probable costs of correcting the faults that arose in the contract. The scope of the warranty
provision is established based on:

- previous experiences in similar projects;

- the anticipated scope of the extra work; and

- the estimated cost.

###### Onerous leases

When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is immediately
recognized as an expense in its entirety. An onerous lease is a contract in which the unavoidable costs for meeting
the obligations under the contract exceed the anticipated financial benefits. The expected loss is immediately
recognized as a cost in its entirety.

###### Description of Key Line Items

Set forth below is a brief description of the Caverion Group’s key income statement line items.

_Revenue consists of primarily of revenue from the Services and Projects business units._

- Revenue from our Services contracts is recorded using the percentage of completion method, based on
the extent of work completed. This is determined either by the proportion of costs incurred relative to the
total estimated costs, or through the physical progress made. For specific lifecycle maintenance contracts,
revenue is recognized progressively as we fulfill separate portions of the contract, with monthly payments
adjusted by a maintenance index. In these cases, the completion stage is measured similarly by comparing
the costs incurred to the total expected costs.

- For our Projects revenues, we record earnings based on the percentage of the project completed. This
completion percentage is calculated either by comparing the costs incurred up to the current reporting
period against the total expected costs, or by assessing the actual physical progress of the project.

For more information on the Caverion’s Group’s revenue recognition policy, see Note 2.1 to the Caverion Audited
Consolidated Financial Statements.

from EUR 209.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to EUR 195.8 million for the three months

###### Performance obligations

A performance obligation is a distinct promise in the customer contract to transfer goods or services to the
customer. In the Projects and Services business, performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of
a project or service to the customer. At the Caverion Group, control is transferred mainly over time and payment
is generally due within 14-45 days. In most of the contracts that the Caverion Group has with its customers only
one performance obligation is identified. Many contracts include different building systems (e.g. heating,
sanitation, ventilation, air conditioning and electricity) that the customer has ordered from the Caverion Group.
All the different building systems (i.e. disciplines) could be distinct, because the customer could benefit from
those on their own. However, if the customer wanted to get all the building systems as a whole and the customer
has requested for all technical solutions/services as one package, they will not be considered distinct.

In addition, the Caverion Group also provides project management services and is responsible for managing the
project. This integrates goods and services as one total deliverable or combined output to the customer and means
there are no separable risks related to the different parts of the project, as the project has one total price for the
full delivery and possible sanctions are defined at the contract level. In the Services business, performance
obligations are maintenance agreements and separate repair orders which are distinct. The Caverion Group has
lifecycle contracts, where maintenance phases are recognised over time as separate performance obligations.
During the maintenance period, the Caverion Group receives payments on a monthly basis. Consideration for
the maintenance periods is tied to the maintenance index. Revenue is recognised under the percentage of
completion method and the stages of completion of these contracts are measured by reference to the contract
costs incurred up to the end of the reporting period as a percentage of total estimated costs for the contract.

For more information on our performance obligations see Note 2.1 of the Caverion Audited Financial Statements.

###### Pensions obligations

The Caverion Group has defined benefit pension plans in Norway, Germany, Austria and Finland. In all plans
the pension liability has been calculated based on the number of years employed and the salary level. Most of
the pension plans are managed in insurance companies, which follow the local pension legislation in their
management. In Sweden, the Caverion Group participates in a multi-employer defined benefit plan through
Alecta. Alecta does not provide access to information that would make it possible for the Caverion Group to
recognize this plan as a defined-benefit plan, so it is accounted for as a defined contribution plan.

Pension scheme liabilities vary with changes to long-term interest rates, inflation, pensionable salaries and the
longevity of scheme members. During the periods under review, liabilities in respect of provisions for pensions
decreased from EUR 50.6 million as of December 31, 2021 to EUR 41.9 million as of December 31, 2022 to
EUR 39.7 million as of December 31, 2023, and further decreased to EUR 39.5 million as of March 31, 2024,
with changes driven primarily by an increase in interest rates in 2022 and 2023. The assumed discount rate
increased from 0.80 per cent. in Finland, 1.50 per cent. in Norway, 0.90 per cent. in Germany and 0.80 per cent.
in Austria for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 3.30 per cent. in Finland, 3.20 per cent. in Norway, 3.00 per
cent. in Germany and 3.00 per cent. in Austria for the year ended December 31, 2022 to 3.40 per cent. in Finland,
3.70 per cent. in Norway, 3.50 per cent. in Germany and 4.00 per cent. in Austria for the year ended December
31, 2023.

###### Commitments and contingent liabilities

Given the nature of Caverion’s Projects business unit, Caverion Group companies are involved in disputes and
legal proceedings in several projects. These disputes and legal proceedings typically concern claims made against
the Caverion Group for allegedly defective or delayed delivery. In some cases, the collection of receivables by
the Caverion Group may result in disputes and legal proceedings. There is a risk that the client presents counter
claims in these proceedings. The outcome of claims, disputes and legal proceedings is difficult to predict. Writedowns and provisions are booked following the applicable accounting rules.

The nominal amount of leasing commitments of low-value and short-term leases amounted to EUR 8.8 million,
EUR 5.4 million, EUR 9.9 million, EUR 5.8 million and EUR 10.4 million, respectively, as of December 31,
2021, 2022, December 31, 2023, March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024. The present value of lease liability of
leases not yet commenced to which the Caverion Group is committed amounted to EUR 0.1 million, EUR 1.1
million, EUR 2.2 million, EUR 0.0 million and EUR 1.1 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2021, 2022,
December 31, 2023, March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024.

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Caverion Group had outstanding bank guarantees in an amount
of EUR 117.3 million.

The Caverion Group recognised a contingent liability in the amount of EUR 500.3 million related to the guarantee
by Caverion that consist of counter guarantees for external guarantees and parent company guarantees given
according to general contracting practices.

Additionally, entities participating in a demerger are jointly and severally responsible for the liabilities of the
demerging entity which have been generated before the registration of the demerger. EUR 20.4 million and EUR
21.5 million, respectively, were recognised in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023 related to a secondary
liability generated to Caverion, a company established in the partial demerger of YIT Corporation in 2013,
resulting from guarantees that remain with the YIT Corporation that were generated before the registration of the
demerger.

Lastly, some civil claims presented against Caverion Deutschland GmbH in relation to old cartel cases have been
settled between 2021 and 2024, in an aggregate amount of approximately EUR 20 million. See “Business—
_Litigation—FCO Investigation.”_

Caverion Deutschland GmbH is also currently facing a claim that has allegedly been filed with a court during
April 2024 that purportedly amounts to approximately EUR 27 million and relates to an alleged breach of contract
associated with a construction project that was initiated in 2015, and completed in 2021. The parties have been
in dispute over this matter over the past several years, during which time various attempts at settlement have
been made. As the court has not yet served the claim on Caverion, Caverion has not yet been able to fully assess
the claim and, as of March 31, 2024, no additional provisions have been recognized in connection with the
alleged court filing, pending further information and analysis. See “Business—Litigation—Breach of Contract
_Claim.”_

For more information regarding the Caverion Group’s commitments and contingent liabilities, see Note 5.10 to
the Caverion Audited Consolidated Financial Statements.

###### Interest Rate Risks

The Caverion Group's approach to managing interest rate risk involves a strategic focus on stabilizing the
potential impact of market interest rate fluctuations on its financial performance. The Caverion Group’s revenues
and operating cash flows are largely shielded from changes in interest rates, aside from interest-bearing
receivables in its cash and cash equivalents . Its exposure to cash flow interest rate risk arises mainly from current
and non-current loans. Borrowings issued at floating interest rates expose the Caverion Group to cash flow
interest rate risk. To manage the exposure that arises from loans with variable rates, the Board of Directors of the

179


-----

Caverion Group has defined an average interest rate fixing term target for the Caverion Group’s net debt
(excluding cash). The average interest rate fixing term of the Caverion Group’s net debt (excluding cash) was
13.6 months, 28.1 months and 14.0 months, respectively, as of December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023. The Caverion
Group ensures regular monitoring of the potential effects that interest rate shifts could have on its financial
results, particularly the implications of a rise in interest rates on net interest expenses annually.

###### Financial Counterparty Risks

The Caverion Group's approach to managing financial counterparty risks involves multiple levels of oversight
and measures to ensure the reliability of its financial partners. Caverion’s Group Treasury is in charge of
managing the counterparty risk linked to derivative instruments and financial investment products. Caverion
chooses its counterparties based on management's assessment of their reliability, and the Board of Directors
approves main bank relationships and derivative instrument counterparties. Additionally, the Caverion Group’s
chief financial officer has been responsible for approving counterparts for short-term investments. Investments
related to liquidity management are made in line with Caverion’s Treasury Policy. Furthermore, the Caverion
Group is exposed to secondary liability stemming from a partial demerger of YIT Corporation, for which
Caverion could be held responsible should YIT Corporation default on certain obligations remaining postdemerger. See “—Commitments and contingent liabilities.”

###### Refinancing and Liquidity Risks

The Caverion Group's strategy for managing refinancing and liquidity risks is driven by the objective to ensure
that the Caverion Group has sufficient funds available for debt repayment and ongoing business needs. To
mitigate refinancing risk, the Caverion Group diversifies the maturities of its loans and monitors the balance of
its short-term and long-term debt. The Caverion Group maintains an adequate liquidity reserve by keeping a
buffer of unused committed credit facilities.

Further, the Caverion Group acts proactively to secure its liquidity position either by opportunistically incurring
new debt to refinance existing debt, or by engaging in liability management transactions, including conducting
opportunistic tender offers or repurchases of its outstanding debt, thus reinforcing its long-term liquidity position.
The composition of the Caverion Group’s debt portfolio is split between borrowings from financial institutions
and funds raised from investors. The Caverion Group's liquidity risk management involves regular assessment
of the Caverion Group’s financial covenants and maintaining a range of funding sources, including cash reserves,
overdraft facilities, and revolving credit facilities, to support its financial obligations and operational needs.

###### Foreign Exchange Risks

The Caverion Group's presence in international markets subjects it to foreign exchange risks, largely in relation
to assets and liabilities, as well as net investments in foreign operations. While commercial contracts in
subsidiaries do present foreign exchange risk, these contracts are typically denominated in the entity’s functional
currency to minimize exposure.

Caverion aims to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on its financial performance by
managing risk associated with cash flows, receivables, and payables. Caverion does not, however, hedge its
investments in foreign operations against foreign exchange translation risk. According to the Treasury policy, all
Caverion Group companies are responsible for identifying and hedging foreign exchange risk related to foreign
currency denominated cash flows. The Caverion Group Treasury then, in turn, hedges the net position with
external counterparties, but does not apply hedge accounting under IFRS 9 for derivatives that hedge foreign
exchange risk. This means that changes in fair values of derivative instruments are recorded directly in the
income statement.

As a result of the above, the Caverion Group believes that excluding the foreign exchange differences due to
translation risk related to the investments in foreign operations, fluctuations in the strength of the euro does not
have a material impact on its financial performance.

180


-----

###### Operational Risks

 Economic Activity

Fluctuations in the economy affect the building services sector, which is sensitive to market fluctuations and
political decisions that can have an impact on demand for residential and commercial new builds and investments
in industry and the public sector. Demand for service and maintenance work is less sensitive to fluctuations in
the economy.

###### Tendering

The Caverion Group's tendering process encompasses various operational risks including pricing accuracy and
contractual terms. The Caverion Group enforces risk assessment and review processes during both the sales and
execution phases to identify and mitigate such risks, making necessary risk reservations. There is, however, an
inherent risk that despite robust project management processes, unanticipated issues may arise, potentially
leading to financial write-downs, disputes, or legal challenges. These risks can materialize as project write-downs
during the year.

###### Contractual Terms

The Caverion Group encounters risks associated with the contractual terms and conditions it agrees upon within
its Services and Projects business segments. These risks involve potential issues with pricing accuracy, adherence
to contract stipulations, and the management of long-term service commitments and guaranteed service levels.
To mitigate these risks, the Caverion Group implements rigorous risk assessment and review processes at both
pre-sales and execution stages, and maintains ongoing oversight through its Projects and Services Business Units.
Despite these measures, contract-related risks may still lead to financial disputes, additional provisions, or
litigation, influencing the Caverion Group’s financial position and performance.

###### Disputes

The Caverion Group is generally involved in disputes and legal proceedings due to the nature of its Projects
business, typically related to claims against the Caverion Group for alleged defects or delivery delays. The
process of receivable collection may also lead to disputes and legal proceedings, with the risk of counterclaims
from clients. The unpredictability of these legal outcomes may necessitate the booking of write-downs and
provisions in accordance with accounting rules.

###### Information Security

Reliability of the key IT systems and partnership is essential for the Caverion Group's continuous operations.
Prolonged disruption in the key systems could limit the Caverion Group’s ability to conduct operations in a
profitable and efficient manner. In addition, increasing sophistication of and frequency of unauthorised access
and cyber threats pose a risk to the Caverion Group's information assets, while data privacy related breaches may
have a negative impact on its reputation. Over time the Caverion Group has made significant investments in its
IT systems, and there is a risk that the expected pay-back of these investments is not fully materialised.

###### Compliance

The Caverion Group has compliance-related obligations, which may pose operational challenges. In 2018,
Caverion Deutschland GmbH was fined for anti-competitive practices for incidents which took place between
2005 and 2013. Although a settlement was reached with the German Federal Office, there remains a risk of civil
claims against the Caverion Group. See “Business—Litigation—FCO Investigation”. The Caverion Group takes
several measures to ensure it fulfils its compliance-related obligations including, but not limited to, employee
training and maintaining a culture of zero-tolerance on illegal practices.

###### Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements

 Revenue under POC method for contracts

Contracts under the percentage of completion (“POC”) method are recognized as revenue on the stage of
completion basis when the outcome of the project can be estimated reliably. The stage of completion of these

181


-----

contracts are measured by reference to the contract costs incurred up to the end of the reporting period as a
percentage of total estimated costs for the contract or evaluated based on physical stage of completion. Due to
estimates included in the revenue recognition of contracts under the POC method, revenue and profit presented
by financial period only rarely corresponds to the equal distribution of the total profit over the duration of the
project. When revenue recognition is based on the POC method, the outcome of the projects and contracts is
regularly and reliably estimated. Calculation of the total income of projects involves estimates on the total costs
required to complete the project as well as on the development of billable work. If the estimates regarding the
outcome of a contract change, the revenue and result recognised are adjusted in the reporting period when the
change first becomes known and can be estimated. If it is probable that the total costs required to complete a
contract will exceed the total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately.

###### Receivables

According to Caverion Group policy, write-offs or provisions are booked on receivables when it is probable that
no payment can be expected. Caverion Group follows a policy in valuing trade receivables and the bookings
include estimates and critical judgements. The estimates are based on experience with write-offs realised in
previous years, empirical knowledge of debt collection, customer-specific collaterals and analyses as well as the
general economic situation of the review period. The Caverion Group carries out risk assessments related to POC
and trade receivables in its project portfolio on an ongoing basis.

###### Taxes

Management evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation
is subject to interpretation. The tax provisions recognised in such situations are based on evaluations by
management. Evaluating the total amount of income taxes at the Caverion Group level requires significant
judgement, so the amount of total tax includes uncertainty.

###### Provisions

Provisions are recorded when the Caverion Group has a legal or constructive obligation on the basis of a past
event, the realisation of the payment obligation is probable and the amount of the obligation can be reliably
estimated. Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditure required to settle the obligation.

###### Acquisitions

The Caverion Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The total consideration
transferred for the acquisition is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the possible
equity interests issued by the Caverion Group. The total consideration includes the fair value of any asset or
liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired, liabilities and
contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair value at the acquisition
date. The measurement of the fair values requires management judgement and is based partly on management's
estimates.

###### Goodwill impairment

Goodwill is reviewed for potential impairment whenever there is an indication that the current value may be
impaired, or at least annually. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units are determined based on valuein-use calculations that are based on management's best estimate of market developments for the subsequent
years. The recoverable amounts are assessed in relation to different time periods and the sensitivity is analysed
for changes in the discount rate, profitability and the terminal growth rate. If future cash flows are discounted at
a higher interest rate, the recoverable amount would be lower. The reverse would apply if the recoverable amount
were to rise in conjunction with discounting at a lower discount rate.

###### Employee pensions

The Caverion Group has defined benefit pension plans in Norway, Austria, Germany and Finland. The pension
obligations are calculated using actuarial assumptions, and plan assets are marked to market on the balance-sheet
date. A change in any of these assumptions and measurements could have a significant impact on calculated
pension commitments and pension cost.

###### INDUSTRY

 Introduction

Through the combination with Caverion, the footprint of the Assemblin Caverion Group has expanded outside
the Nordic region, to also include Germany, Austria and the Baltics. The Nordic market remains the largest
market for the Group, accounting for approximately 80% of its Combined Group Net revenues for the Aggregated
LTM Total and will be the focus of this section. The respective regions exhibit similar characteristics and secular
trends, which will be covered as part of the industry summary.

###### Market overview

The installation market can be segmented into two categories: (i) new-build installations and (ii) renovation,
maintenance and services of existing installations. Because the European construction market is mature, most of
the activity is driven by renovation, maintenance and services of existing installations, rather than new-build.

- **_New-build installations_**

Demand for new-build installation results generally from the demand for new-build construction and has
therefore been sensitive historically to macroeconomic factors such as GDP growth, interest rates and
real-estate prices, among other factors, although with a slight time lag owing to the downstream nature of
the activity (installation occurring at the end of the construction process of a building). Although the new
construction segment is generally cyclical, significant local and regional variations within different
countries influence end-market exposure. It is also worth noting that public sector spendings have
historically exhibited less volatility compared to the residential and commercial construction sectors,
primarily because government spending in the region have historically been increased during economic
downturns.

Due to a reduction in economic activity caused by the current macroeconomic environment, new
construction activity in the near-term is expected to experience some slowdown as projected by an
independent third-party consultant for 2024. However, the Group has limited exposure to new-build
installations and in particular to markets expected to experience the sharpest contraction, such as new
residential construction. Moreover, as a leading player with scale and a track record of execution
excellence in a fragmented market, the Group is well positioned relative to the small- and medium-sized
players in terms of cyclicality and to potentially gain further market share.

- **_Renovation, maintenance and services_**

Demand for maintenance has generally shown a higher level of stability compared to new-build and,
similar to renovation, is largely driven by the age and composition of the buildings. During economic
downturns, customers have a demonstrated preference for renovation and maintenance as opposed to new
construction, which has traditionally resulted in countercyclical effects in the renovation and maintenance
segment. Expenditures on renovation and maintenance are more flexibly managed and constitute part of
a customer’s general operating expenses, making them less susceptible to reductions in customer spending
and resulting in stable revenue flow for service providers. Moreover, demand for renovation and
maintenance is primarily driven by the age and composition of real estate.

Given its high resilience, it can be expected that the renovation market will sustain stable growth in the
near term as projected by an independent third-party consultancy.

The installation market can also be segmented by activity into: (i) Electrical; (ii) Heating and Sanitation and (iii)
Ventilation.

- **_Electrical is one of the largest installation market segments and includes the installation of wiring and_**
fittings, lighting systems, street lighting, electrical signs, airport runway lighting, satellite dishes, alarms,
solar energy collectors and connecting of electronic appliances, as well as their maintenance and repair.

183


-----

- **_Heating and Sanitation_** includes the installation of plumbing and heating systems, as well as their
maintenance and repair.

- **_Ventilation includes the installation of ventilation and air-conditioning systems, as well as their_**
maintenance and repair.

Some activities are regulated, and our technicians and engineers (in particular plumbers and electricians) are
required to be certified, which creates staff scarcity in some of our market segments. Larger companies such as
our Group are perceived as more stable and offering greater career opportunities to staff in the long-term. The
Group is therefore well placed to benefit from the barriers to entry stemming from certification requirements.

###### Nordic market size and outlook

The Nordic installation market, defined as the combined installation markets of Sweden, Denmark, Norway and
Finland, is a highly fragmented market, estimated at SEK 350 billion aggregate spend in 2023 according to an
independent third-party consultant.

In 2023, the new-build installation market represented about 35 per cent of the Nordic installation and service
market, while the renovation, services and maintenance market accounted for the remaining 65 per cent.,
according to the same independent third-party consultant. The market is expected to exhibit steady growth,
despite some near-term headwind being expected in the new-build market.

The following table sets forth the historical and forecast evolution of the size of the various market segments
within the Nordic installation market for the years indicated.

_SEK billion_ **2017** **2023** **2026** **2017-2023** **2023-2026E**

New-build...................................................................... 83 123 122 7% (0%)

Renovation and maintenance ......................................... 108 146 168 5% 5%

Service........................................................................... 67 81 89 3% 3%

_Source: Independent third-party consultant, Prognoscentret and public sources_

###### German and Austrian market size and outlook

Similar to the Nordic market, the German and Austrian market is expected to exhibit steady growth in the
medium-term.

The German and Austrian market is strongly driven by renovation due to the aging house stock, strict regulations
and green initiative targets. The market size is estimated at €214 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow at a rate
above GDP until 2026 according to an independent third-party consultant. In Germany, the new-build installation
market represents about 23 per cent of the installation and service market, while the renovation, services and
maintenance market accounts for the remaining 77 per cent, according to the same independent third-party
consultant.

###### Secular growth drivers

Beyond macroeconomic and cycle considerations, several structural growth trends within the installation market
support long-term market growth. These include:

- **_Energy efficiency: Increasing demand for energy efficient systems in buildings, driven by economic,_**
environmental and regulatory pressures, provide significant growth opportunities, wherein installation
solutions can be customized to each building to achieve low energy use. Stimulus programs introduced
by various national governments and the EU to kick start recovery from the current economic slowdown
are expected to help accelerate this trend as a number of these stimulus programs are specifically targeted
or focused on the Green agenda. Examples include Sweden’s SEK 9.7 billion proposal for investments in
green recovery initiatives in the Budget Bill for 2021, Germany’s €200 billion energy relief plan in

184


-----

October 2022, the EU’s €500 billion green stimulus package passed in July 2020, Norway’s May 2020
proposal to spend €360 million to support a greener economy and the EIB’s €150 million in financing for
new near-zero-energy buildings and renovation investments to improve energy efficiency of existing
buildings in the Helsinki metropolitan area;

- **_Growing demand for more advanced technology systems: Increasingly tech-heavy properties require_**
more advanced technology systems, with a higher demand for IoT, energy efficient systems and security
system automatization offering several growth avenues;

- **_Increasing pace of urbanization: Increased inflow of inhabitants in larger cities increases the need for_**
new residential buildings and public properties while also placing greater requirements on safer and more
efficient and modern premises;

- **_Higher degree of digitalization: Growing digitalization creates new requirements for managing data and_**
allows for the creation of new technical installations to monitor and optimize energy efficiency while also
driving greater demand for service due to increased complexity of technical installations and systems;

- **_Partnering projects: New forms of close collaboration between various parties in the construction process_**
increases the importance of coordination of installations while also enabling greater efficiency in the
production process and energy usage through multi-tech procurements; and

- **_Greater need for renovation in ageing buildings: A significant portion of the building stock is of_**
considerable age, prompting an upcoming renovation wave for buildings that were constructed during the
1970s and 1980s, and this renovation wave is also driven by the potential to reduce energy usage through
renovations in existing building stock.

The acquisition of Fidelix increased our exposure to the rapidly growing building automation markets of building
management systems (“BMS”) and individual metering and debiting (“IMD”). These end-markets have grown
at a rate above the rest of the installation market and are expected to continue to do so in the medium- to longterm. The factors driving the robust market growth include energy efficiency, sustainability, cloud computing
and IoT, tightening regulation, increase in energy prices and focus on indoor climate. Moreover, the scope of
activities and services for Fidelix is continuously expanding, driven by advancements in technology in machine
learning, automated diagnostics and smarter building automation systems. These macro drivers also result in a
high level of cycle resilience.

###### Competitive landscape

The Nordic installation market is highly fragmented, and competition is largely focused on a contract by contract
basis at a local level. As a result, the Group rarely competes against larger pan-Nordic players such as Bravida,
Instalco, GK or Kemp & Lauritzen but rather against local small or medium-sized enterprises (“SMEs”), such as
ELEffekt and Robmac.

The German and Austrian installation market is highly fragmented and local, especially in the new-build and
renovation project segment. In Germany, the largest players are mostly integrated players which offer technical
and infrastructural services, such as Apleona, SPIE, Wisag and Strabag. In Austria, the largest players include
Ortner and Engie in the project segment and ISS, Dussmann, Simacek and Sodexo on the service side.

We believe that customers demand an increasingly broad range of services and expertise from installation
services providers, including a single point of contact for delivery of integrated solutions, in order to optimize
their procurement process. Many SMEs specialize in a particular activity and regional area but are unable to offer
“one-stop shop” solutions. This offers a potential advantage of larger groups and has led to the consolidation of
small, local businesses over the years which is a trend we expect will continue.

This is particularly true for larger projects, which are generally awarded on price, but also on some qualitative
factors such as breadth and depth of services, technical know-how, ability to deliver tailored, state-of-the-art
solutions across multiple fields of technology, which tend to play well to the advantage of larger players. Scale

185


-----

itself is a differentiating factor as SMEs are unlikely to have the financial strength to undertake large, lengthy
projects.

Moreover, as customers increasingly evaluate the value position of service providers in terms of ongoing
performance of installed equipment, technological competence is becoming particularly important. The Group
has maintained a clear strategic focus on technologies and digital systems, and Fidelix’s technology-driven focus
is helping to solidify the Group’s positioning, particularly in one of the most attractive niches of the installation
services market that caters to building automation. As a fully integrated player in this market, Fidelix faces
competition from different parts of the value chain. Competitors include large industrial goods players such as
Schneider and Siemens which are the only players bigger than Fidelix in its focus markets of Finland and Sweden.
However, unlike Schneider and Siemens which are only focused on large projects, Fidelix is able to cover a wider
installed base, creating upselling and aftermarket sales opportunities, references and expertise across building
types and deeper visibility into market outlook. Fidelix has been able to build on this further with its established
position, open system and competitive pricing to capture market share, as has been consistently seen historically.

Local contracts tend to be of smaller size and are often awarded based on customer relationships with managers
at local branches, in addition to price considerations. It is therefore critical to empower staff locally so that they
are incentivized to develop not only customer relationships and intimacy, but also raise brand awareness and
maximize talent acquisition. Network density and customer proximity can create cost and service quality
leadership which a one-branch competitor would not benefit from.

###### Overview

We are one of the Nordic region’s leading providers of smart and sustainable installation and service solutions,
with our primary activities focusing on electrical engineering, heating & sanitation, ventilation and smart
buildings & automation, such as building management systems (“BMS”) and individual metering and debiting
(“IMD”), as well as key competencies in data & telecoms, industrial pipes, district heating, cooling, sprinklers,
security and green technology solutions (“GreenTech”). In April 2024 we completed our combination with
Caverion, one of Europe’s leading providers of technical solutions for buildings and industries in Finland,
Sweden, Germany, Norway, Austria and the Baltics, which has increased our capabilities in smart and
sustainable solutions and expanded our geographic scope of operations.

We hold a strong position in the growing installation market in the Nordic countries in which we operate
(comprising Sweden, Norway and Finland). With the Caverion Combination (as defined in _“—The_
_Transactions—The Caverion Combination”) we now also have a presence in Denmark, Germany, Austria, the_
Baltics (comprised of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) and Poland. The Nordic countries in which the Combined
Group operates (comprising Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland) are estimated to have had an installation
and services market value of SEK 350 billion in the year ended December 31, 2023, according to
Prognosesenteret, whilst the Austrian and German markets were estimated to have had a combined value of €214
billion in the year ended December 31, 2023, according to an independent third party consultant. Our multitechnical offering, market share and size have enhanced our position as an experienced and trusted partner that
provides reliable and efficient high-quality services in the context of an ongoing transformation towards a more
energy-efficient and sustainable society.

We provide design, installation, maintenance and service solutions for a wide range of properties, industrial
facilities and infrastructure projects for a diverse customer base consisting of over 76,000 large and small
customers on a Combined Group basis, which include construction companies, the public sector, property owners
and industrial companies. Our installation business consists of the installation of technical systems as part of
the construction of new properties and the renovation or upgrade of technical systems as part of the
reconstruction and renovation of properties, improving their functionality and comfort. Our design and
maintenance capabilities complement our installation business. Lastly, our service business consists of the
operation, maintenance, repair, replacement, reconfiguration and monitoring of technical installations in
buildings, industrial plants and infrastructure. Our strong relationships with our customers have contributed to
a Combined Group Order backlog of SEK 32,713 million as of March 31, 2024, with more than 1,100 ongoing
projects as of March 31, 2024 on a Combined Group basis. We take on primarily two types of assignments:
contractor assignments (which include new construction projects and major renovations) and service assignments
(which include service, maintenance and minor renovation assignments). Contractor assignments and service
assignments represented 43 per cent. and 57 per cent., respectively, of our Combined Group Net revenue for the
twelve months ended March 31, 2024.

187


-----

Our operations are decentralized and governed based on a shared framework, clear allocation of roles and
responsibilities and systematic monitoring. Before the Caverion Combination, Assemblin’s operating
organization was divided into five specific business areas: three in Sweden (Assemblin Electrical, Assemblin
H&S and Assemblin Ventilation), one in Norway (Assemblin Norway) and one in Finland, which also includes
BMS products and IMD operations in Sweden and Norway (Assemblin Finland), comprising approximately 189
units (which are the physical branches) with 7,077 FTE employees in the Nordic region as of March 31, 2024.
With the Caverion Combination, we have added 178 units with 14,380 FTE employees in total, as of March 31,
2024, and we expect to restructure our operations into four segments: Sweden (comprised of Assemblin
Electrical, Assemblin H&S and Assemblin Ventilation and Caverion’s Sweden division), Norway (comprised of
Assemblin Norway and Caverion’s Norway division), DK + DACH (comprised of Caverion’s Denmark,
Germany and Austria divisions) and Finland + Fidelix (comprised of Assemblin Finland and Caverion’s
Finland, Baltics and Industry divisions). We believe that our decentralized business model contributes to the
profitability of our operations. This decentralized and entrepreneurial business model allows us to swiftly adjust
to a largely variable cost structure and promotes enterprise and accountability at all levels of our structure, with
the president of each business area being responsible for managing the operations and earnings of the respective
business areas.

The following map represents the locations in which the Combined Group operated as of March 31, 2024.

Assemblin has been owned by Triton since 2015, and since then we have expanded our geographical presence
and volumes through the acquisition of 80 additional companies to date excluding Caverion (45 of which were
since January 1, 2021). Between January 1, 2021 and December 31, 2023, the Caverion Group completed 25
acquisitions. Our organic and inorganic growth has made us into a full-service installation and service partner,
with the strength of a multidisciplinary group and the personal presence of a local company.

In the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, we had total Pro Forma Net revenue of SEK 43,079 million, a Pro
Forma loss for the period of SEK 468 million, Pro Forma EBITA of SEK 2,068 million, Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITA of SEK 2,511 million, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of SEK 3,525 million and Pro Forma Adjusted RunRate EBITDA of SEK 3,733 million.

###### Competitive Strengths

 The combination with Caverion has enhanced Assemblin’s scale, diversification, competitive positioning and business mix, thereby creating a business profile with significantly increased resilience

Increased scale: Assemblin’s Adjusted EBITDA for the Aggregated LTM Total, was SEK 1,359 million.
However, our Pro Forma Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA, which includes adjustments for the Caverion
Combination, for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 was SEK 3,733 million. The increased scale results
in improved competitive positioning, as explained below.

Increased diversification: On a standalone basis, of Assemblin’s Net revenues for the 2023 Aggregated Total, 71
per cent. was derived from Sweden, 15 per cent. from Finland and 15 per cent. from Norway. The Caverion
Combination not only increases diversification within the Nordics, but also adds significant presence in the large
addressable markets of Germany, Austria and the Baltics. Of the Combined Group Net revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2023, 37 per cent. was derived from Sweden, 24 per cent. from Finland, 15 per cent. from Norway,
4 per cent. from Denmark, 12 per cent. from Germany, 7 per cent. from Austria and 1 per cent. from the Baltics.
This enhanced regional presence reduces the Combined Group’s dependence on the macroeconomic environment
in any one country.

Enhanced market leadership and geographical presence: The increased scale and diversification also results in
the Combined Group having strengthened market positions and geographical presence across a wider range of
countries relative to the standalone Assemblin Group. Based on our analysis of publicly reported revenues, on a
Combined Group basis we are the largest company in the Northern European countries in which we operate

189


-----

(comprised of Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Germany and Austria), the largest company in the Nordic
countries in which we operate (comprised of Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark), the largest company in
Sweden, the largest company in Norway, the largest company in Finland and within the top five largest in
Denmark in the respective installation and services markets, in each case based on Combined Group Net revenue
for the year ended December 31, 2023. For the basis of this analysis, see “Industry and Market Data.” We were
also the fifth largest in Germany and the third largest in Austria, on a Combined Group basis based on Caverion
revenue and reported revenue of relevant peers for the year ended December 31, 2021, according to an
independent third party consultant. Additionally, on a standalone basis, as of March 31, 2024, Assemblin had
151 units in Sweden, 17 units in Finland and 23 units in Norway. On a Combined Group basis, as of March 31,
2024, we had 194 units in Sweden, 77 units in Finland, 54 units in Norway, 9 units in Denmark, 18 units in
Germany and 13 units in Austria.

Improved business mix: Prior to the Caverion Combination, Assemblin had developed an effective model for
project bidding and execution with a smaller but growing multi-year services business. On a standalone basis,
services contributed to 42 per cent. of Assemblin’s Net revenues for the 2023 Aggregated Total (comprised of 42
per cent. for the Assemblin Financing Group for the four-month period ended May 2, 2023 and 41 per cent. for
the Assemblin Group for the eight-month period ended December 31, 2023). Caverion, on the other hand, has
had a focus on the services business, with offerings such as technical facilities management. The combination of
Assemblin and Caverion therefore brings together highly complementary businesses, with the former having a
reputation for projects and the latter possessing good standing in services. On a Combined Group basis, the
Group will have strong expertise across both projects and services, but with services contributing to 57 per cent.
of Combined Group Net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 (compared to the installation and services
market in Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark, which are comprised, as a whole, of 77 per cent. in services
and 23 per cent. in projects). This skew towards services makes the Group highly resilient given the multi-year
and recurring nature of services.

The combination with Caverion therefore significantly enhances the strength of Assemblin which has been
proven over the years through consistent EBITA and EBITA margin expansion, and high cash generation. The
strengths of the Combined Group are detailed below.

###### Exceptional scale and local density in a market with attractive and resilient growth, underpinned by stable and accelerating long-term megatrends

The Nordic installation and services market has historically shown resilience during economic downturns. For
example, the renovation and services market in the Nordics during the 2008-2009 financial crisis experienced
slow growth, rather than a decline, and the services market was only moderately impacted by the COVID-19
pandemic. Renovations and new build projects continued growing throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and the
services market suffered only a slight contraction due to the difficulty experienced by services technicians in
gaining access to work-sites and buildings due to pandemic restrictions (rather than demand-driven factors).
Similarly, during the high inflationary environment experienced from 2022 onwards, the renovation and services
markets in the Nordics have continued to grow, whilst the new build market has experienced only a marginal
contraction.

Our resilience during the recent global economic challenges has been enhanced by our significant exposure to
the services market (57 per cent. of our Combined Group Net revenue for the twelve months ended March 31,
2024) and limited exposure to new builds. Other factors that add to our resilience are our order backlog of
committed orders that allows us the planning horizon to adjust our cost base and project margins after dips in the
construction market. Moreover, diversification across different geographical regions ensures that the Group is
more resilient to economic shocks in any particular country that it operates in within Europe.

The Nordic markets in which we operate are also expected to grow, as estimated by an independent third-party
consultant, by a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 3 per cent. from 2023 to 2026, reaching a combined
approximate value of SEK 379 billion in 2026). Between 2023 and 2026, we expect the market to experience a
CAGR of 0 per cent., 5 per cent. and 3 per cent. in the new build, renovation and services segments, respectively.

-----

The installation and services market’s growth is driven by a number of positive mega-trends driving investments
in the space, which stems from ageing and energy inefficient buildings, the changing and growing needs of the
population, building upgrades with smart and sustainable solutions and sustainability goals which will require
installation and services solutions to be achieved. These trends are underlined by market requirements, including:
(i) the non-cyclical and reinforced need for renovations of the large stock of ageing and inefficient buildings in
the EU: it is estimated that as of 2019, approximately 35 per cent. of the building stock in the EU is over 50 years
old and approximately 75 per cent. of the buildings stock in the EU is energy inefficient; (ii) the changing and
growing needs of the population: there is expected to be a 17.5 per cent. population growth in Sweden, Norway
and Finland between 2019 and 2070, and 70 per cent. of Swedish workplaces as of 2021 are maintaining or
enabling hybrid working environments; and (iii) the upgrade of buildings with smart and sustainable solutions:
more than 30 per cent. of public and non-residential buildings with EPC ratings of “G” and below are expected
to be upgraded by 2030 and there is an estimated €5 trillion investment needed in energy renovation to meet the
European Union’s Net Zero emissions target. In the installation and services market, the key drivers are also
expected to include: (i) cost inflation (estimated 2 to 3 per cent. CAGR contribution from 2023 to 2026), as passthrough mechanisms are generally included in contracts driving overall nominal market growth; (ii) growth in
building stock (estimated 0 to 1 per cent. CAGR contribution from 2023 to 2026), as the growth in underlying
building stock drives an increase in the number of installations and therefore service requirements; (iii) service
and installation intensity (estimated 0 to 1 per cent. CAGR contribution from 2023 to 2026), as increased
installation intensity and complexity drive the need for more frequent and qualified service; and (iv) a slowdown
in new build volume (estimated negative 1 per cent. CAGR contribution from 2023 to 2026), as this slowdown
is primarily driven by a decrease in residential new builds, all according to an independent third-party consultant.
We are strongly positioned to succeed in this attractive and resilient growth market, leveraging our market leading
position which has been significantly strengthened following the Caverion Combination, as shown in the chart
below, which presents our market position and market share on a Combined Group basis in Sweden, Norway,
Finland, Denmark, Germany and Austria, compared to the market share of our top three competitors for the same
periods.

In addition to leading positions at the country level, the Group has selectively targeted local regions within
countries where it holds strong market positions. This is reflected by the diagram below showing the percentage
of the Combined Group’s Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 in Sweden, Norway, and Finland
split by regions where we have (i) less than 5 per cent. market share for those respective regions, (ii) between 5
and 10 per cent. market share for those respective regions and (iii) more than 10 per cent. market share for those
respective regions.

Note:

where we have (i) less than 5 per cent. market share for those respective regions, (ii) between 5 and 10 per cent.
market share for those respective regions and (iii) more than 10 per cent. market share for those respective regions.

(2) Based on 2022 revenue data, does not include technical facility management, high voltage and Caverion’s Industry
division in Finland.

Our increased group-wide scale and local strength provide differentiating competitive advantages. At the segment
level, we are able to utilize our procurement expertise to optimize sourcing supplier terms within each segment
and leverage our digital capabilities. We also have strong HR, financial and business development functions
complementing resources on a regional and local level. We can also leverage certain central functions such as
finance, legal, communication and our central IT platform. Finally, our capabilities across the Group can be used
to provide customers with comprehensive solutions that span a range of technical disciplines.

At the local level, our geographic network comprises approximately 369 units on a Combined Group basis, as of
March 31, 2024, in close proximity to customers in selectively targeted markets. In certain locations, our
segments share premises, which allows for significant cross-selling and cost-reduction opportunities. In addition
to being better positioned to win local tenders, our cross-staffing ability between units allows us to optimize
project selection. Further, our local scale has allowed us to build a workforce of approximately 21,500 employees
(on a Combined Group basis) as of March 31, 2024, with many of our employees preferring to work for a larger,
but decentralized, company such as ourselves due to supportive and clear governance, stability, brand awareness
and personal development opportunities.

###### Highly complementary skills across the full life-cycle of customer needs, creating a virtuous cycle that drives cross-selling across advisory & engineering, projects & services

The Combined Group boasts a portfolio of complementary capabilities that cater to the full life-cycle of
customers’ needs, generating a virtuous cycle that optimizes cross-selling across the advisory engineering,
services and projects segments. Our client relations will be enhanced by offering ongoing services, which in turn
can unlock lucrative projects assignments, and further advisory & engineering tasks that provide profound
insights into clients’ assets. This strategic integration augments our local service capabilities and allows early
engagement in our clients’ value chains, fostering deep relationships. It is supported by comprehensive, longterm contracts for onsite managed services and technical facility management, enhancing operational excellence.

192


-----

Additionally, Assemblin has traditionally excelled in projects, while Caverion has demonstrated strength in
services, further emphasizing the complementary nature of the business of the Combined Group.

Moreover, our distinguishable services and advisory & engineering capabilities offer both route and site-based
models, which extend our conversion capabilities from services to advisory & engineering to projects, adding
incremental value to the relationship lifecycle with our clients. Our specialization in GreenTech solutions,
coupled with refined project bidding and management expertise across an array of project sizes and disciplines,
makes us well-positioned for effective projects executions. Our approach promotes recurring cash flow and
visibility from our order book, anchored by a cost+ approach to pricing.

###### Relentless focus on operational excellence with a proven playbook to drive profitability improvement

We believe that our decentralized business model, structured around technical disciplines and supported by strong
leadership teams, creates a distinct competitive advantage compared to other players in the market. The division
of our business into technical disciplines allows managers and their teams to focus on growing operations within
their areas of expertise. This structure also provides career development opportunities for talented employees
within their respective business lines and promotes sharing of experiences, competences, and best practices.
Furthermore, we believe that it is more attractive for acquired companies to be integrated into a segment focused
on the same technical discipline as themselves, and our structure facilitates the efficient integration of acquired
companies.

While we maintain a strong shared culture based on core values, guiding principles and fundamental ethical
standpoints set forth in our Code of Conduct, we promote an “entrepreneurial” culture within each segment. Unit
managers are expected to drive margin improvement and lead a specialized and skilled workforce. Typically, unit
managers are selected based on their personnel management skills and previous project managing experience.
Unit managers receive financial incentives in the form of bonuses based on Adjusted EBITA margin and working
capital levels, and these targets have a high level of uniformity across units in order to motivate underperforming
and averagely performing units towards the desired margin levels. The size of these bonuses depends on the size
of the unit, the manager’s monthly salary, and the portion of Adjusted EBITA margin above a pre-determined
threshold. Incentive payments for unit managers can equal up to six months of the unit managers’ salaries. In
addition, we operate a system with a focus on cash generation being emphasized, by letting unit managers
pay/receive interest on net working capital balances. Lastly, all unit managers are offered the opportunity to
invest in the management incentive programme and over 600 employees are expected to be shareholders in the
Group following completion of our management incentive programme, which aligns interest across the
organization and encourages the managers to support the long-term goal of the Group to deliver consistent and
low-risk growth in EBITA and cash.

The success of our business model is evidenced by our track record of margin improvement (even through the
integration of previous bolt-on acquisitions) and strong employee retention levels of 90 per cent. for the year
ended December 31, 2023 (compared to 88 per cent. and 87 per cent. for two of our top competitors and according
to their public reporting).

Whilst our decentralized model is a key enabler of our commercial success, with customers who seek close
proximity with their services provider, and with a structure that allows our unit managers to navigate local market
dynamics in a quick and agile manner, the Group has a comprehensive governance model in place to ensure
robust control over performance beyond aligning incentives with our employees as explained above.

Our governance model includes systematic project selection criteria and process management measures, the
replacement of underperforming unit managers and projects, closure of non-performing units and a corporate
culture focused on profitability over volume. We also maintain structured follow-up and reporting procedures,
user-friendly business intelligence tools for performance monitoring and EBITA and net working capital-based
employee incentives on a unit level.

193


-----

To help us continuously monitor our profitability enhancement measures, we track the following KPIs across our
organization:

We also have a proven ability to implement operational efficiency measures, with an example of this being the
successful implementation of our Accelerated Profitability Programme in 2019, where we delivered
approximately SEK 70 million of savings through overhead savings such as reduction in overhead costs across
the organizational structure and approximately SEK 11 million through pruning of underperforming branches,
including eight underperforming units and some small offices, and other operational efficiency measures.

The result of our robust operational model is visible in the EBITA margin growth Assemblin has delivered over
the years and evident in our improving margins at the individual unit level. At Assemblin, we have reduced the
proportion of loss-making units in our network from approximately 27 per cent., as of 2017 to 13 per cent. 2023.
At the same time, the proportion of units delivering over 8 per cent. Assemblin EBITA margin increased from 16
per cent. to 35 per cent. over the same period. Significant improvement has also been seen at Caverion with the
proportion of loss-making units reducing from 24 per cent. in 2019 to 16 per cent. in 2023. The diagram below
shows the split of our units by profitability across various EBITDA levels for Assemblin and Caverion.

**Evolution of Assemblin unit profitability**

194


-----

**Evolution of Caverion unit profitability**

Despite this improvement, we believe we will continue to have opportunities to increase our margins through
our organizational structure and strong profitability focus. We plan to continue to incentivize our unit managers
to seek margin enhancement initiatives on a local unit level, to drive operational efficiency improvements and
further cost consciousness. We are able to implement our business model and focus on margin improvement
through our acquired businesses.

###### Unique positioning within the high growth and high margin GreenTech segment

We believe that we are well positioned to benefit from the expected growth in higher margin segments of the
installation and services market, such as smart buildings, GreenTech, and niche segments, mainly including fire
& security, sprinklers, cooling and refrigeration.

We believe that our position as a sizeable player within the BMS segment, with strong technical competence and
end-to-end integration solutions, combined with our proprietary product offering, provides a competitive
advantage. We can offer complete bespoke solutions to customers, from design to installation and subsequent
servicing of the systems.

Furthermore, we have a strong GreenTech offering, which includes resource-efficient products and solutions to
improve energy efficiency and optimization, solar panel installations, Energy Performance Contract (EnPC)
solutions that help decarbonize building stocks, renewable heating solutions and electric vehicle charging
solutions and BMS solutions. We have enhanced our GreenTech offering through the acquisitions of Tom Allen
Senera, a Finnish provider of energy optimized systems for buildings including, among others, geothermal
solutions, and Electrotec Energy, an experienced solar panel installation provider with experience in solar cells
and energy storage. Through our BMS and GreenTech offering, we are strongly positioned to support our
customers’ smart building, digitalization and energy transition.

Not only are these segments supported by a highly attractive growth outlook (the BMS market is estimated to
grow at a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 8 per cent. between 2021 and 2026, according to
public sources) underpinned by a critical need to make buildings energy efficient, but these segments also benefit
from a highly attractive margin profile.

195


-----

The strength of our presence in this segment is evidenced by our share of EU taxonomy aligned revenues
significantly exceeding peers, as shown below compared to our top two comparable peers.

Note:

(1) Revenues from activities that are aligned with a net zero trajectory by 2050 and the broader environmental goals
other than climate per EU taxonomy for sustainable activities classification system.

(2) Based on data for the year ended December 31, 2023 for the Combined Group, and publicly reported data for the
years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023 for Competitor #1 and Competitor #2, respectively.

###### Diversified and low-risk revenue with high visibility from a strong order backlog and recurring services

We operate a business that is diversified amongst different end-markets, regions, specific customers and contract
size. We operate a diversified mix of end-market segments with 57 per cent. of our Combined Group Net revenue
generated from the services segment, 11 per cent. of our Combined Group Net revenue generated from the
industrial segment, 10 per cent. of our Combined Group Net revenue generated from the social infra segment
(consisting of health centers, hospitals and educational buildings), 7 per cent. of our Combined Group Net
revenue generated from the residential segment, 6 per cent. of our Combined Group Net revenue generated from
the offices segment, 4 per cent. of our Combined Group Net revenue generated from the public infra segment
(consisting of infrastructure, traffic, storage and transit halls), 3 per cent. of our Combined Group Net revenue
generated from retail and Hotels, Restaurants and Cafes (“HoReCa”) segments and 2 per cent. of our Combined
Group Net revenue generated from culture and sports for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our customer base
is also diversified, as, according to our management’s estimates, our top ten customers, on a Combined Group
basis, accounted for approximately 10 per cent. of our Combined Group Net revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2023.

Our geographical footprint across Europe also ensures that we are not significantly exposed to the macroeconomic events in any single country. In the year ended December 31, 2023, in terms of our Combined Group
revenue, 37 per cent. was generated from Sweden, 24 per cent. was generated from Finland, 15 per cent. was
generated from Norway, 12 per cent. was generated from Germany, 7 per cent. was generated from Austria, 4
per cent. was generated from Denmark and 1 per cent. was generated from the Baltics.

Furthermore, we have limited exposure to large contracts that would expose us to material risk from any one
project. Management estimates that projects (which include both installation projects as well as certain services
projects subject to percentage of completion accounting) over EUR 15 million, between EUR 5-15 million,
between EUR 1-5 million, between EUR 0.5-1 million and less than EUR 0.5 million represented 7 per cent., 8
per cent., 14 per cent., 5 per cent. and 9 per cent. of our Combined Group Net revenue, respectively, with the
remainder  being derived from services.

We also benefit from a high level of visibility in our business model. Our order backlog enhances near-term
visibility and has consistently stayed above 70 per cent. of revenues on an annual basis since the year ended
December 31, 2021. We take a consistent approach to order booking and only include signed contracts in our

196


-----

order backlog. Our order backlog is also conservatively stated as we are able to pass through inflationary effects
to our customers rather than adjusting backlog upwards.

The share of services, as a portion of our Net revenues has remained strong and stable over the years. During the
year ended December 31, 2021, service represented 42 per cent. of our Net revenues at Assemblin, whilst services
represented 41 per cent. of Assemblin’s Net revenue for the Aggregated LTM Total over the twelve months ended
March 31, 2024. The Caverion Combination has significantly increased the share of services to 57 per cent., as
a percentage of our Combined Group Net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023.

###### A cash generative and robust financial profile supported by cost base flexibility, inflation resilience, structurally low capital expenditures and working capital intensity

The Combined Group has displayed a strong track record of growth and profitability over the historical period.
The Combined Group has delivered a CAGR in Combined Group Net revenues of 7 per cent. between January
1, 2021 and March 31, 2024. This has been supported by impressive organic growth, averaging 4 per cent. across
the period for the Combined Group. A low-risk M&A strategy has supplemented the organic growth profile
historically.

Similarly, the Combined Group has delivered impressive EBITA expansion over the historical period with
consistent margin improvement. The Adjusted EBITA margin for the Combined Group has increased from 5.0
per cent. between the period ending December 31, 2021 to 5.8 per cent. over the last twelve months ended March
31, 2024.

Our high cash flow generation has been driven by capital-light operations together with efficient working capital
management. Our operations require very limited capital expenditure and lease expenses, which primarily
comprises of tools, vehicles refurbishment and IT costs. On a Combined Group basis, our Combined Group Net
Tangible Non-lease Capital Expenditure as a percentage of Combined Group Net revenue was 0.2 per cent. in
the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, as well as for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. On
a Combined Group basis, our net working capital as a percentage of Combined Group Net revenue was negative
6.6 per cent., negative 5.1 per cent. and negative 5.5 per cent. in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and
2023, respectively, and negative 5.6 per cent. for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024.

We have a high focus on working capital management across the Group. Our ability to generate free cash flow
has contributed to our growth and has allowed us to undertake a successful acquisition strategy. Our successful
and proven business model, combined with well-established long-term customer relationships, should promote
our goals to continue to achieve profitable growth and deleverage going forward.

Even in an inflationary environment, our contract structures drive our ability to achieve our desired level of
profitability. According to management estimates in 2022 for Sweden and Norway, approximately 65 per cent.
of Assemblin’s contracts as of December 31, 2022 were structured with cost-plus pricing, an approach giving us
the ability to pass through input price inflation onto our customers. We are also able to mitigate inflationary
pressures on the remaining approximately 35 per cent., consisting of fixed price contracts that typically have a
short-term contract length and an optimized central procurement system, which allows us to manage the delay
of impact and apply indexing. For any long-term fixed price contracts, those are predominantly managed using
double index dynamics where we index to customers, and suppliers index to us, ensuring further protection
against inflationary pressures.

197

The diagram below shows our management’s estimate of Assemblin’s revenues by contract type during the year
ended December 31, 2023, assumed to be consistent with the estimates in 2022.

Note:

(1) Estimates are indicative and based on management’s review with local managers in Sweden and Norway of contracts
that were expected to be delivered in 2022. For Service – Cost + contracts, management believes it is able to reflect
the impact of inflation in its pricing of service assignments (including driven by the small and short term-nature of
some of the service assignments). In management’s opinion, small and short-term service assignments are cost plus
in nature as they allow for a high conviction view on the impact of inflation on expected costs, and pricing is set
accordingly to secure a desired level of profitability.

The resilience of our margin profile is enhanced by the fact that, on a Combined Group basis, 91 per cent. of our
costs as of December 31, 2023 are either variable or semi-variable. These costs are largely related to labor and
materials, with minimal overhead and fixed assets. Furthermore, our cost base is largely safeguarded against
inflation due to the short duration of projects and wage pass-through clauses incorporated into both services and
longer-duration project contracts.

###### Excellent management team set up to capture the best of both Assemblin and Caverion, supported by a highly experienced financial sponsor in the sector

Our decentralized network is managed by a highly experienced management team, consisting of professionals
with strong backgrounds and operational expertise within technical installation and services solutions, and a
proven track record of acquiring and integrating new businesses, with strong leaderships centered around
technical disciplines. Under the Assemblin Group AB leadership, we have had a successful track record of margin
expansion and have positioned us as a leading installation company in the Nordic region. Caverion’s leadership
has equally shown a successful track record of margin expansion, specifically after Jacob Götzsche’s appointment
as President and CEO in 2021 and has positioned Caverion as a leading digital and services player in the Nordics.
We believe that the harmonisation of highly experienced management teams following the Caverion
Combination, at the Group as well as at the unit level, provides us with a key advantage in continuing to seek
growth and development of each segment and for the Group. There is strong cultural alignment across the teams,
with a relentless focus on operational excellence.

###### Our Strategy

 Capitalize on an enhanced offering of the Group to continue to deliver market leading installation and services solutions

The Group combines the strengths and capabilities of both Assemblin and Caverion, offering a broader range of
services and providing sustainable technical solutions to an expanded customer base. Following the Caverion
Combination, we have completed a transformational step in creating scale, further diversification, strengthened
market leadership and density and an enhanced services offering as part of the Group’s product mix. This will
provide a platform to capture a larger share of opportunities in the highly resilient markets in which we operate.
Further, the synergies that we are able to benefit from following the Caverion Combination will provide operating

198


-----

efficiencies going forward and will allow us to execute our backlog more efficiently with the possibility of further
enhanced profit margins. Some of the steps we have already taken in order to deliver the synergies from the
Caverion Combination include prioritizing the integration of operations and focusing on profitability
improvements, implementing our proven organizational roadmap to ensure a smooth transition and securing
business continuity from day one. We have also reduced selling, general, and administrative expenses by
emphasizing a lean organizational structure and eliminating overlaps. Furthermore, we are consolidating and
managing our unit network with a focus on leveraging complementary strengths to boost overall performance
and actively pursuing quick wins in procurement processes.

Within the first 100 days following the Caverion Combination we expect to secure SEK 180 million in synergies
comprising SG&A savings through overhead reductions such as reductions in managerial and administrative
overlap, both on a Group and divisional level. We have already actioned 57% of these as of April 30, 2024, with
the remainder expected to be fully executed in the first half of 2024.

Furthermore, we are analyzing certain under-performing operations in Sweden, Norway and Finland, with a view
to improving or discontinuing them in 2024, which is fundamental to the Group’s future margin improvement.
Additional savings resulting from IT optimizations and efficiencies as well as procurement improvements are
also expected between 2024 and 2025. Overall, we expect that the total savings resulting from the above efforts,
including further SG&A reductions will be achieved within the first 24 months following the Caverion
Combination and will exceed twice the amount of our currently quantified overhead savings.

Further, we expect the commercial possibilities within cross-selling, leveraging complementary strengths and
utilizing the Group’s strengthened geographical density to both drive more sales and enable better solutions for
the existing customer base as well as using other units instead of external subcontractors to improve margins.

###### Continue to focus on profitable growth by lifting performance across the Group's unit network

We are determined to grow our business profitably and sustainably, fulfilling our potential by increasing market
share and winning new projects and services contracts without compromising on profitability.

We are well positioned to grow our market shares in Sweden, Norway and Finland by continuing to provide highquality services and by focusing on strengthening local operations. We intend to continue to operate a large,
decentralized organization, with local units operating as individual profit centers, and to uplift margins in average
and underperforming units. Due to our decentralized organization, unit performance, and the ability to improve
unit profitability margins, are highly dependent on attracting, retaining and motivating key employees, including
unit managers. We evaluate unit performance issues through a comprehensive set of key performance indicators,
such as employee competence, contract execution, order intake, procurement performance, services portfolio
management, overhead management and invoicing/cash collection procedures, and we address performance
issues through a tailored action plan. Specifically, we aim to improve margins at average and underperforming
units through: (i) a strong focus on active performance management of local operations; (ii) employee education
and skill enhancement initiatives (including training and monitoring courses for technicians to drive upselling
and better leverage our brand); (iii) unit governance improvements including, among other things, improved
tendering procedures and an efficient internal scorecard process; (iv) the accelerated deployment of digital tools,
including financial transparency tools, both on a unit as well as on a project level; (v) accelerated project-toservices revenue conversion (by means of enhanced indicator-tracking and follow-up procedures); and (vi)
expanding to new untapped customers (based on a systematic customer base analysis to identify high potential
accounts, leveraging unit best practices for new customer conversion and tracking customer conversion at the
Group level). Assemblin’s Adjusted EBITDA margin for the Aggregated LTM Total of 9.3 per cent., however,
was a significant improvement from Assemblin’s Adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.7 per cent. for the year ended
December 31, 2022. Our Combined Group Adjusted EBITDA margin for the twelve months ended March 31,
2024 was 8.2 per cent.

199


-----

Our approach to continuing our stable and profitable growth can be summarized below.

We have a strong record of historic margin improvements across our business, in part due to our efforts to
improve profitability and cut costs across the Group and maximizing margins remains one of our long term
growth strategies.

###### Grow the services business across the Group

We have transitioned from a mainly project-focused organization to establishing separate local services
organizations with dedicated services managers, increased the hiring of services technicians and also established
separate tracking measures and employee and manager margin-linked incentives.

The Caverion Combination has moved our product mix into an enhanced percentage of revenues related to
services, and we expect that growth in our services revenues will increase our bottom line, as our services
assignments tend to have higher margins than our contractor assignments. On a Combined Group basis, our
Combined Group services revenue accounted for 57 per cent. of our Combined Group Net revenue for the twelve
months ended March 31, 2024.

We aim to drive further growth in the services business by: (i) applying best practices developed by services
champions across our entire unit network; (ii) identifying, attracting, training, retaining and motivating a
sufficient number of highly skilled technical employees, which we consider to be a key factor to grow the
relatively personnel-dependent services business across the Group; (iii) strengthening the coordination of our
sales teams to increase project-to-services sales conversion; (iv) consolidating the services segments from
Caverion and (v) enhancing key account management activities to increase the number of larger services
customers assignments.

###### Continue our proven and margin accretive acquisition strategy

We continuously evaluate new opportunities to acquire installation and technical services providers in Northern
Europe in order to strengthen our local competitive position, complement our offering and consolidate our
presence in attractive market segments. We have proven experience in identifying, executing and integrating
other companies, while remaining committed to our existing business model and values and while in 2024 the
pace of our acquisition activities might slow as a result of our integration efforts related to the Caverion
Combination, selective acquisitions remain a part of our medium term strategy. To complement our business
strategy, we focus on targets with high margins, typically paying a multiple of approximately 4-6 times the
target’s EBITA, with an average target EBITA margin of above Assemblin’s existing margin levels. In order to
grow through margin accretive acquisitions, we need to maintain operating agility and a strong ability to react to
changing market dynamics, including a potential increase in competition for the acquisition of attractive targets
(which could result in higher purchase price multiples). We have differentiated acquisition capabilities which
cover the full cycle of an acquisition process from the screening phase (by means of decentralized deal sourcing
by segment), to execution (through a Group acquisition team providing execution bandwidth) and including postclosing integration (by means of tailored toolboxes and governance solutions). Whilst management is looking
forward to delivering the strong value creation potential possible through the combination of Assemblin and

200


-----

Caverion, going forward we will focus on selectively acquiring small sized targets in line with what has been
done historically.

###### Accelerate growth in new expanding segments, building on strategic investments

Over a number of years, we have strengthened our position by complementing our traditional focus on technical
disciplines such as electrical, heating & sanitation, and ventilation, with growth in the smart buildings market
segment, GreenTech solutions, and other niche segments such as cooling and refrigeration (which typically have
higher growth and margins than the overall installation market). We expect to further expand our share in these
markets by combining our expertise with the capabilities of the companies acquired in recent years such as
Fidelix, Tom Allen Senera and Electrotec Energy. Electrotec Energy and Tom Allen Senera have strengthened
our offering of sustainable installation solutions, particularly in the areas of installation of solar panels and energy
storage (through the installation, maintenance and servicing of panels and energy storages) and heat pumps
(through a diversified product range including ground space, air to water and exhaust air implementing
installation with storage solutions), while the acquisition of Fidelix has enhanced our position in the BMS market
segment.

###### Recent Developments

 Bolt-on Acquisitions

Since April 1, 2024, excluding the Caverion Combination, no acquisitions have been completed.

###### Trading Update

Based on preliminary results from our unaudited management accounts for April 2024, and other information
currently available, we estimate our net revenue as well as Adjusted EBITDA (including margin) remain on the
same trajectory as the quarter ending March 31, 2024. The year-to-date performance on these metrics continues
to exceed the relevant period in the prior year.

The above information relating to our current performance is derived from our internal management accounts.
Our management accounts are produced by financial reporting systems that we use as the basis of preparation
for our annual results at the end of each fiscal year. This information has been prepared by management. It has
neither been audited, reviewed, verified or subject to any procedures by our auditors nor been approved by our
Board of Directors, and you should not place undue reliance on it. This information should not be considered
indicative of our future results. This preliminary indication is based on management’s initial review of our results
of operations and is subject to change. See “Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” “Risk
_Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—_
_Assemblin” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—_
_Caverion” for a discussion of certain of the factors that could affect our future performance and results of_
operation.

###### History

In 2016, following the acquisition by Triton, we changed our name to Assemblin. Prior to the acquisition, we
were Imtech Nordic, which was the result of the acquisition of a number of leading companies in Nordics with
strong reputations in their respective technical disciplines often spanning decades:

- Our Assemblin Electrical business area dates back to 1931, when Närkes Elektriska, NEA was founded
in Örebro. NEA eventually expanded nationwide in Sweden and became a leading actor in electrical
installations. Acquisitions over time, including the acquisition of Skanska Installation in 2016, have
contributed to what is currently the Assemblin Electrical business area.

- Our Assemblin H&S and Assemblin Norway business areas date back to 1902 and 1903, when the
companies Sana and Nordiska Värme were originally founded. In 1964, both companies joined to create
NVS, which became one of the leading heating & sanitation actors in the Nordic region and the
cornerstone of both the Assemblin H&S and the Assemblin Norway business areas.

201


-----

 - Our Assemblin Ventilation business area dates back to 1999, when Sydtotal was founded by industry
veterans in Malmö, to offer ventilation systems. The Assemblin Ventilation business area has since
expanded both through acquisitions and through greenfield expansion across Sweden.

 - The Assemblin Finland business area dates back to 2007, when EMC was founded to provide multidisciplinary projects and maintenance, including electrical, plumbing and ventilation in Finland. The
Assemblin Finland business area has undergone extensive development in recent years, and the
acquisitions of both Fidelix and Tom Allen Senera greatly enhanced the breadth and quality of services
provided.

With Triton as our owner, we have subsequently grown through the acquisition of approximately 80 additional
companies, excluding the Caverion Combination but including large acquisitions such as our 2016 acquisition
of Skanska Installation, a carve-out from the broader construction company Skanska and our acquisition of
Fidelix in 2020. In 2022 and 2023, these acquisitions included businesses with estimated aggregated annual
revenues of approximately SEK 1.2 billion, strengthening our footprint across each of our business areas. In
April 2024 we completed the Caverion Combination. Caverion is a Finland-headquartered provider of sustainable
multi-technical installation and service solutions for the built environment. As a result of the Caverion
Combination, we have a Combined Group footprint that now spans across the Nordic, DACH regions and the
Baltics, comprising approximately 21,457 employees across 10 countries through approximately 369 units as of
March 31, 2024. See “—Recent Developments—Caverion Combination” and “—Caverion Overview.”

Our organic and inorganic growth has made us into a complete installation and service partner, with the strength
of a multidisciplinary group and the personal presence of a local company.

Over time, we have grown from a centralized business model with a focus on traditional capabilities such as
electrical, heating and sanitation and ventilation to a decentralized business model with improved governance, a
strong governance team and disciplined prioritization of projects with a focus on margins over volume. In recent
years, we have focused on growing our services business and accelerating accretive M&A (including the
transformative Caverion Combination), integrating ESG into our strategy and expanding our digital capabilities,
as well as focusing on high profitability at the unit level, such as through our accelerated profitability program in
2019. Our business today is set up for accelerated growth, with a focus on building automation and GreenTech.

###### Caverion Overview

In April 2024, we completed the Caverion Combination. See “Summary—The Transactions—The Caverion
_Combination.” The Caverion Group is among Europe’s leading providers of technical solutions for buildings and_

had 11 employees and estimated aggregated annual revenues of EUR 2 million. This acquisition was made with
cash on balance sheet. See Note 5 to the Caverion Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial
Statements.

###### Group Structure

We conduct our business through a number of subsidiaries. For more information on our corporate structure, see
“Summary—Corporate Structure and Certain Financing Arrangements.”

###### Description of our Operations

Our operations are decentralized and governed based on a shared framework, clear allocation of roles and
responsibilities and systematic monitoring. Prior to the Caverion Combination, Assemblin’s operating
organization was divided into five business areas: three in Sweden (Assemblin Electrical, Assemblin H&S and
Assemblin Ventilation), one in Norway (Assemblin Norway) and one in Finland, including BMS products and
IMD operations in Sweden and Norway (Assemblin Finland), comprising approximately 189 units and 27
regions in Sweden, Norway and Finland as of March 31, 2024. Caverion’s operations were split largely according
to geographically-based divisions, including: Sweden, Finland, Germany, Norway, Austria, Denmark and Other
countries (comprised of the Baltics). The Industry division operates in Finland, Estonia and Poland and covers
all phases of the industrial life cycle, from construction and projects at industrial plants to many types of technical
maintenance assignments. As of March 31, 2024, Caverion had 178 units in total.

Following the Caverion Combination, we are undertaking a process to fully integrate Caverion with our
operations. In this offering memorandum we present the following illustrative segments to reflect the Caverion
Combination: Sweden (comprised of Assemblin Electrical, Assemblin H&S and Assemblin Ventilation and
Caverion’s Sweden division), Norway (comprised of Assemblin Norway and Caverion’s Norway division), DK
+ DACH (comprised of Caverion’s Denmark, Germany and Austria divisions) and Finland + Fidelix (comprised

204


-----

of Assemblin Finland and the Caverion’s Finland, Baltics and Industry divisions). Such segments are presented
for illustrative purposes only and we may ultimately decide to structure our organization according to different
segments going forward.

Geographical segments will be further divided into a number of divisions, regions and units (representing
physical branch locations). Divisions within each segment will include Austria, Denmark, Finland & Baltics,
Germany, Industry, Norway and Sweden, and will be further broken down into the regions in which they operate.
At the regional level, local unit performance is monitored monthly and reported to the segment’s management.
Local units are responsible for earnings, personnel, sales and customer relationships. Managers at the regional
level are responsible for implementing the segment’s strategy in the region as well as for sourcing potential
acquisition targets. In addition, the regional functions provide support to units during project tender processes.
This is generally the case with larger tenders, while small tenders are managed at unit level. At the segment level,
regional performance is monitored monthly and reported to Group management. Each segment sets its strategy
in accordance with the Group strategic outlook, and provides direct support to units also with regard to
operational challenges.

At the Group level, finance, legal, IT, communication, operational & commercial performance and sustainability
functions are maintained. To ensure consistent and high standards across our business areas, the Group’s strategy
and business planning, corporate governance, internal control, risk management and sustainability and
digitization initiatives are coordinated at the Group level. We communicate our framework through intra-Group
communication initiatives, meetings and training sessions (both physical and web-based). We also set minimum
requirements at the Group level for additional corporate functions, such as common standards for HR,
procurement, business ethics and environment.

Our strategic outlook is set out in a six-year horizon plan. Based on our horizon plan, we set three-year business
plans, which have associated goals and actions for each segment, region and unit. Our business plan is reviewed
by the board of directors on a yearly basis. We implement our business plan through our annual budgets and
activity-based action plans for both the entire Group and for each segment, and the business plan is supplemented
with local action plans for each region and unit. We are currently evaluating new objectives for six-year strategic
outlook and setting a three-year plan to promote the achievement of these goals.

We believe that our decentralized business model contributes to the profitability of our operations. This
decentralized and entrepreneurial business model allows us to swiftly adjust to a largely variable cost structure
and promotes enterprise and accountability at all levels of our structure with each of the segment’s business
presidents being responsible, together with their management groups, for the operations and earnings in their
respective segment. For more information on the benefits of our decentralized business model, see “Competitive
_Strengths—Operating model underpinned by disciplined local entrepreneurship coupled with a relentless focus_
_on operational excellence.”_

designs which links to Assemblin Ventilation’s project management system (“CAMvent”). CAMvent can
also be connected to our BIM 360 systems thus enabling an automatic sharing of information with the
relevant customers’ systems. CAMvent strengthens Assemblin Ventilation’s ability to provide maximum
quality and cost efficiency for its customers. Assemblin Ventilation is particularly strong in the southern
part of Sweden.

- **Caverion’s Sweden division: This division historically offered services in Sweden across Caverion’s**
Services and Projects business units. However, as a result of the Caverion Combination and ongoing
integration efforts, this division will focus on technical facility management and advanced service and
solution offerings. Installation projects will be reallocated to Assemblin's existing divisions in Sweden.

###### Our Customer Base and Customer Contracts

 Our Customer Base

We have a diversified customer base which values our high technical competence, ability to timely conclude
projects, strong local presence and documented experience with specific types of building construction. Our
customers range from multi-regional companies to small local businesses and property owners in a variety of
industries, as well as the public sector and large industrial clients.

- **_Multi-regional construction companies: The Nordic construction market has several large, multi-_**
regional companies which manage large, medium and small-sized projects, and use installation providers
such as us as subcontractors. We primarily conduct contractor assignments (i.e., installation work for new
buildings or renovation projects) for these companies. Examples of customers within this customer group
include Peab, Strabag, NCC, YIT, Veidekke and Skanska.

- **_Local construction companies: We also work closely with local construction companies in a_**
subcontracting role, primarily focusing our work on contractor assignments. In the local construction
market, strong relationships are essential to maintaining customers and partnerships.

212


-----

- **_Public institutions: Many of our local customers are public institutions, which contract with us through_**
a public procurement process with strict specifications. Our work for public institutions includes both
project and service assignments. Examples of our customers include pension companies, county
councils/regions (such as Region Östergötland), municipalities, Akademiska Hus and FMV. They also
include Northern Ostrobothnia Hospital District, City of Helsinki, City of Espoo in Finland and Aarhus
Kommune, Städtishes Klinikum Braunschweig and St. Jospehs Hospital Wiesbaden in DK+DACH.

- **_Large real-estate developers and property owners: We work with large real-estate developers and_**
property owners on new build installation or renovation projects and service assignments (tailored for
existing buildings, including technical property management, energy solutions and maintenance).
Examples of our customers include Technopolis, Obos, Thon, Ikano, Riksbyggen and Locum.

- **_Retail chains and energy companies: Energy companies and retail chains, are highly knowledgeable_**
about their own products and production processes. We provide both service and installation based
assignments for these customers. Examples of our customers include Kesko, EON, Fortum, IKEA and
Skellefteå Kraft.

- **_Industrial: We also serve an industrial client based through industrial project installations, engineering_**

- **_Defense, financial services, telecom, processing and pharma: We provide both installations and basic_**
maintenance as well as more comprehensive technical facility management contracts for defense,
financial services, telecom, processing and pharma companies, e.g. Danske Bank, SAAB, Telia and
Viking Malt.

- **_Small businesses and property owners: Small businesses, private individuals and property owners_**
purchase both service and contractor assignments, but they do so with less frequency than our larger
customers.

We are not reliant on any of our largest customers as, for the year ended December 31, 2023, management
estimates that the ten largest customers of Assemblin accounted for approximately 16 per cent. of Assemblin net
revenue and the ten largest customers of Caverion accounted for approximately 12 per cent. of Caverion revenue.
With the Caverion Combination, our project base consists of a mix of large and smaller-scale projects.

###### Tender Process and Pricing

We obtain most projects and services agreements through competitive bidding in tender processes. The procedure
for obtaining assignments differs with respect to installation projects, on the one hand, and service assignments,
on the other hand. The tender process for installation projects typically involves substantial preparation work,
including estimates, planning and negotiations with the potential customer. Depending on the size of the potential
project, a tender process can last from a few days to more than a year. Agreements are signed at a fixed price or
on current account (meaning that they are on a running basis without the size and duration of the project defined
at the beginning of the project and costs billed for hours worked and materials used to the customer), but
sometimes also as partnering agreements where the cost is based on a jointly defined target price with incentives
for all parties to fall below that target price. Our fixed price contracts tend to be of short-term duration, and we
have a strong central procurement function, which allows us to delay the impact of inflationary pressures and
index our costs. Our long term-fixed price contracts are mostly managed with a double index dynamic, whereby
which we index costs to customers and suppliers index costs to us.

By contrast, our service projects are typically based on framework agreements or ongoing relationships, and
contracts are often signed directly with end consumers and occasionally through intermediaries, such as facility

213


-----

management companies. Prior involvement usually offers competitive advantages that can lead to new service
assignments after completed projects.

Pricing for installation and service agreements takes place primarily at the local unit level, with larger projects
and service agreements requiring approval from the Group or the Board. Larger service contracts, such as facility
management contracts, are typically priced by a professional team specializing in contract pricing. Factors that
we typically take into account when pricing installation projects and service agreements may include: (i) the
purchase price of materials; (ii) wages and hourly billing of project managers and employees; (iii) subcontractor
costs; (iv) price differentiation for volume, geography or competence; (v) the fixed price of subscription
agreements (in the service sector); and/or (vi) pricing adjustments relating to the economic cycle and general
pricing adjustments.

###### Customer Contracts and Framework Agreements

Our customer contracts consist of individual service agreements for a fixed period, long-term framework
agreements (typically without agreed volumes) and oral agreements (in daily operations) and relate to contractor
assignments typically consisting of:

- assignments where we are responsible for both the project design and installation activities, mainly for
customers such as construction companies (and typically not for the end-customer);

- assignments where we are responsible for installation activities, while the customer is responsible for the
design of the project (customers in such situations are mainly construction companies or, to a lesser extent,
industrial companies), where we act as subcontractor and enter into standard subcontracting
arrangements; and

- assignments where we are directly responsible for both project design and installation activities to the end
customer (“turn-key” projects), acting thereby as main contractor.

Additionally, we typically provide warranty and support service coverage to our customers. The standard
warranty period for customer agreements for installation projects varies between two and five years on materials
and workmanship from the date of acceptance and approval by the customer. Where applicable, the parties may
sometimes agree on longer guarantee periods for special equipment which is then typically agreed on a back-toback basis with the suppliers. This ensures adequate back-to-back coverage during the standard warranty period.
In addition, we provide project completion guarantees to clients, either through parent company guarantees,
insurance policies or bank guarantees.

In the service business, contracts often include a fixed price component for preventive maintenance and a unit
price list for corrective maintenance and additional work. The duration of the contracts is typically 3-5 years,
and the operation is developed together with the customer with the aim of continuing the cooperation for lengthy
periods. The largest service contracts are often of the facility management type, where the customer outsources
a large part of the real estate services and their management to the supplier. In the broadest sense, the contracts
are life-cycle contracts where the supplier is responsible for the implementation of the installation project and
the maintenance of the technical systems for up to 20-25 years.

A growing trend for our customers is the use of Integrated Project Delivery (“IPD”) (or partnering) contracts,
where we are involved at earlier stages in a project. IPD contracts ensure a more flexible pricing and allow for
changes during the course of the project itself, factoring a common interest between ourselves and the other
relevant parties in sharing risks and opportunities as they arise. The goal of this form of cooperation is that the
parties should have an incentive to help each other achieve a lower final cost and a higher flexibility for late
changes for the buyer and better profitability for installer/contractor through finding smart solutions together.
IPD contracts are deployed throughout our services offering and for larger projects, while smaller, less complex,
projects are based on fixed price terms. During the early phase of a project, the relevant customer agrees with us
the design parameters and pricing in detail before the construction contract is signed. The pricing in these types
of contracts is typically based on a total target price with lower margins for us if the price is exceeded and higher
margins if the final price is in line with the target price or below.

###### Order Intake and Order Backlog

Order intake for Assemblin represents the value of projects and service assignments received and changes to
existing projects and service assignments in the period concerned. Order intake drives the change in the order
backlog over time. Order intake for Caverion represents the revenue expected to be recognized on projects and
contracts from (i) new contractual commitments entered into during the relevant period, plus (ii) changes during
the relevant period to existing contractual commitments.

Order backlog for Assemblin represents the remaining production value in all assignments not completed at the
end of the period. The order backlog is an indicator of the revenue remaining from orders that the Group has
already secured. Order backlog for Caverion represents the remaining revenue expected to be recognized from
ongoing projects and contracts subject to existing contractual commitments as of the end of the relevant period.

Caverion and Assemblin are in the process of reconciling their respective definitions of Order intake and Order
backlog in order to be able to present on a unified basis, as the Assemblin and Caverion the business mix that is
included in the calculations of both Order intake and Order backlog have historically been different.

Our strong relationships with our customers have contributed to a Combined Group Order backlog of SEK
32,713 million as of March 31, 2024 and a Combined Group order intake of SEK 42,951 million for the twelve
months ended March 31, 2024.

The table below sets out the order backlog and order intake on a Combined Group basis for each of our segments
as of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024.

###### Supply and Procurement

We continuously monitor our supplier base in order to ensure diversification, quality, and risk minimization.
Consistent with our objective of providing our customers with competitive prices, we seek to continuously
decrease our total cost of materials while increasing our competitiveness with new suppliers, new purchasing
channels and new products or solutions. To do so, we engage in a two-layered procurement process combining
the central functions of each segment with the individual decision-making of local units.

###### Our supplier base

We have a diversified and high-quality supplier base, which allows us to avoid dependency on any single supplier.
While our procurement activities are conducted locally, we deploy central procurement functions in each
segment, in order to ensure efficient and disciplined procurement streams and more competitive prices. For the
year ended December 31, 2023, the cost of raw materials and consumables amounted to SEK 5,030 million, or
35 per cent. of Assemblin’s total operating expenses of SEK 14,219 million and EUR 639 million, or 27 per
cent. of Caverion’s total operating expenses of EUR 2,339 million. Assemblin’s top supplier accounted for only
13 per cent. of Assemblin’s purchases from our suppliers for the year ending December 31, 2023, while its
top ten and top twenty suppliers accounted for 36 per cent. and 43 per cent., respectively. Caverion’s top supplier
accounted for only 4 per cent. of Caverion’s purchases from our suppliers for the year ending December 31,
2023, while its top ten and top twenty suppliers accounted for 26 per cent. and 35 per cent., respectively.

We mitigate the risks associated with the availability of materials and cost inflation by ensuring supplier
diversification and utilizing an inflation pass-through mechanism. With regard to materials, we select multiple
material suppliers to avoid temporary shortages and postponement in our installation work. Additionally, where
we can, we pass through the cost of inflation to our customers. We monitor material prices on a continuous basis,
and changes in prices are passed through to our customers on a short notice via our pricing manuals (for services
and small projects) while our multi-year contracts include index clauses.

Our supplier base includes selected original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and wholesalers, which deliver
high-quality installation material nationwide on a timely basis. The largest part of our procurement process

216


-----

involves direct material purchases from selected framework agreement suppliers. Our key manufacturers and
distributors are monitored and evaluated on a regular basis to control for benefits and risks.

###### Our material procurement process

The largest part of our purchases are direct materials such as wires, connections, pipes and connectors. A smaller
portion of purchases relates to vehicles, fuel and work-wear. Each segment has its own procurement function
which governs and supports unit level procurement while also negotiating framework agreements with suppliers.
The procurement function is responsible for signing, monitoring and reviewing framework agreements. The
assessment of suppliers involves the evaluation of a range of factors including delivery capacity, warranties,
product responsibilities, and prices. The actual procurement of materials is then done locally by unit or project
managers, who are also responsible for hiring subcontractors for certain tasks, such as insulation work.

###### Sustainability

We aim to act responsibly and to support our customer’s and society’s green transition. To this end, we undertake
several sustainability initiatives to drive our sustainability agenda and to support goals set by national and
international organizations, such as the European Union’s target to be climate-neutral with net-zero greenhouse
gas emissions by 2050. We aim to offer efficient, energy-optimized and adapted installation solutions designed
from a lifecycle perspective, with minimal impact on the environment. This emphasis on sustainability means
that we must be prudent with the resources that we use in our operations, and that we must account for the impacts
created by our service and installation activities. In doing so, we can generate value for customers, employees
and owners, as well as for society as a whole.

In general, our climate footprint is limited. The carbon emissions that Assemblin’s operations generate and can
control (direct emissions) are primarily emissions from transportation (Scope 1 emissions), heating of our
premises and offices (Scope 2 emissions) and business travel (part of Scope 3). Of these categories, emissions
from transportation are the largest. Like Assemblin, the Caverion Group’s operations produce direct emissions
primarily from transportation (Scope 1 emissions) but emissions from leased office buildings (Scope 2 emissions)
are minimal, and some units like Caverion Sweden use 100% renewable energy. Moreover, our operations give
rise to indirect climate impact through the purchase of goods and services (Scope 3). Direct emissions are easier
for us to influence than indirect emissions.

In September 2020, Assemblin launched a climate agenda, with the aim of complementing our climate strategy
with set targets as well as a comprehensive plan for gradual transition to carbon-neutral operations. We also
monitor the climate impact of indirect emissions resulting from our procurement activities. Since 2021, the
Caverion Group has implemented a comprehensive sustainability strategy with the aim that sustainability is
integrated into its overall strategy development, through mapping and reducing its CO2 footprint and submitting
its data to the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) to start science-based reduction of said footprint. The
Group is also actively working towards joining the SBTi over the course of this year.

Our central sustainability committee reports directly to the Group management team and is tasked with
monitoring legislation, following up on shared sustainability initiatives, conducting materiality analysis & risk
assessments, channeling and disseminating good ideas and preparing documentation for decisions by
management. Additionally, the committee analyses semi-annual sustainability data reported from each segment
in order to monitor progress and develop proposals for initiatives prioritized by our Group management team. In
addition, since 2018, we have published an external annual sustainability report, which now complies with the
GRI 2021 standards. In 2023, Assemblin introduced a new reporting process, conducted an updated dual
materiality analysis and prepared for an extended supplier review.

Based on our operations, we have identified a number of key sustainability topics, which are categorized from a
stakeholder perspective. These include our responsibilities as an employer, a supplier, an investment and a
corporate citizen. Assemblin and the Caverion Group have historically set individual targets for sustainability
related metrics and initiatives, including related to carbon emissions. We are in the process of setting new targets
that we expect to be in line with or better than each group’s individual targets and re-working our sustainability
framework for the Combined Group.

###### Responsibility as an employer

We believe that committed, satisfied employees produce better results. Therefore, we identified three
sustainability initiatives designed to further our role as a responsible employer that offers stimulating assignments
in a positive, safe and non-discriminating work environment: (i) development and education; (ii) health and
safety; and (iii) human rights, diversity and gender equality.

We are focused on workplace safety. All of our segments have a target of having zero accidents, and this goal is
supported by our implementation of structured health and safety policies, including extensive development and
training programs.

We also support the principles of the UN Global Compact (which the Caverion Group has signed on to), adopt a
zero tolerance policy for all forms of discrimination and harassment, and actively support gender equality
measures. Within Assemblin, the Norway segment is a sponsor for the industry initiative “Ingeborg”, a women’s
professional network, while our Swedish operations have supported the “Equality at work” industry initiative
since 2017.

###### Responsibility as a supplier

Our aim is to be a responsible and value-adding business partner for our customers. In addition, we strive to be
at the forefront of implementing climate declarations for customers, for example meeting increased climate
declaration demand from builders on building materials. To this end, Assemblin recently launched a pilot project
in Norway, whereby customers will be able to measure and monitor the climate impact of materials in buildings
(while also being provided with increased visibility on scope 3 emissions). We seek to create value for our
customers by providing innovative, sustainable installations that improve building functionality and make people
feel comfortable. In our role as a supplier, we have developed three sustainability initiatives intended to
strengthen our relationship with customers: (i) safe, efficient methods and quality (with related guidelines, tools,
instructions and checklists being made available to employees); (ii) innovative, customized and energy-efficient
customer solutions (for example, we recently matched the requirements of various environmental building
certifications such as Leed, Breeam, the Swan and the EU Green Building); and (iii) sourcing and supplier
management (by means of enhanced work coordination through a joint purchasing forum). The Caverion Group
has similarly collaborated with key suppliers and engaged customers to reduce their CO2 footprint and
implement handprint measures, including but not limited to: smart building automation, smart heating and
cooling, sustainable refrigeration, electric vehicle charging, energy management and advisory services, and
Energy Performance Contracting (EnPC).

###### Responsibility as an investment

We intend to be an attractive investment that delivers stable and profitable growth with controlled risk, adopting
responsible and value-adding strategies. Our sustainability initiatives in this area are focused on (i) producing a
strong yield through stable financial development; (ii) developing policies aimed at measuring risks, ensuring
the strength of our corporate governance and ongoing transparency, and (iii) maintaining sound business ethics.
The above requires the use of sound accounting policies and external auditors, as well as routine reporting of
business and sustainability issues to our owners. Finally, we emphasize the values of our Code of Conduct to all
employees, and hold suppliers to similarly high standards of conduct.

###### Responsibility as a corporate citizen

We intend to be a responsible corporate citizen that conducts sustainable long-term operations with minimal
negative impact on the environment and society. Our main sustainability goal in this category is to minimize our
environmental impact and deliver social benefits to the community. In this capacity, we seek to promote healthy
citizens, create job opportunities and tax revenue and inspire local community involvement, while minimizing
the environmental impact of our operations. For example, during 2020, Assemblin strengthened our measures
for the deployment of a more electrified car fleet in our Norwegian and Swedish operations, including targeted
actions relating to our charging facilities, and in 2023 the proportion of Assemblin’s car fleet that was electric
and electric-hybrid increased to 24% of its total fleet. Assemblin also contribute through sponsorship and
community engagement, mainly at a local level. For example, the Assemblin Ventilation segment sponsors

-----

“Team Rynkeby,” a bicycle project which supports the battle against childhood cancer by raising funds from
sponsors, while the Norway segment continues to support a Zimbabwean village with the deployment of water
and energy projects, an endeavor which has been ongoing since 2017.

###### Acquisitions

We actively monitor the market to identify suitable targets, both from a geographical and technical discipline
standpoint, that we can integrate into our business. Typically, the period from the initial contact to closing an
acquisition ranges from a few months to a few years, and is ultimately dependent on the characteristics of the
individual transaction. Our acquisition process comprises three separate phases: screening, execution and
integration. Potential targets range from smaller accretive investments to material acquisitions.

In recent years, we have also expanded our business, regional presence and capabilities through acquisitions.
Since January 1, 2021, excluding the Caverion Combination, Assemblin completed 45 acquisitions, each of
which strengthened the Group either geographically, or within a specific technical discipline, or both. For
example, the acquisitions of Fidelix, a Finnish company, offering BMS solutions for commercial buildings to
optimize building performance both from a cost and environmental perspective as well as IMD solutions for
residential buildings, and Tom Allen Senera, a Finnish company offering turn-key energy solutions combining a
geothermal component with heat exchangers, cooling and other energy systems, both strengthened our smart
building and automation capabilities. The transformative Caverion Combination also complements our existing
business by expanding our client base and our geographic scope into new markets, while building up our smart
and energy efficiency capabilities.

###### Screening

Our screening of potential acquisition targets is a decentralized process, whereby we leverage our local market
knowledge and relationships of our segments. Central functions at the Group level support to the segments by
offering guidance on the Group’s strategic priorities, which is then applied in determining the suitability of the
relevant acquisition. We focus on high quality companies that prioritize profitability over volume, and have a
track record of strong contract execution. Once a suitable acquisition target is identified in accordance with our
strategic guidelines, we perform a preliminary valuation and submit an indicative bid to the target.

###### Execution

Following the identification of a suitable target, we conduct a thorough review, which includes in-depth legal,
financial, operational and commercial due diligence activity. The board of directors of the Group makes the final
decision on all significant acquisitions.

###### Integration

Once we have entered into an acquisition agreement with the target’s owners, we implement a tailored integration
plan prepared in accordance with a proven set of internal guidelines. Central functions at the Group and segment
levels (including functions such as HR, communication and finance) also provide support through the integration
phase. Owners and managers of the target prior to its acquisition will typically be retained as part of local
management to ensure a continued commitment to strong performance.

###### Human Resources and Personnel

 Employees

As of March 31, 2024, on a Combined Group basis we had approximately 21,457 employees located throughout
Sweden, Norway, Finland, Austria, Germany, Denmark, the Baltics and Poland. The number of employees on a
Combined Group basis for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, and the years ended December 31, 2023,
2022 and 2021, was 21,457, 21,401, 20,755, and 20,212, respectively, comprised of average number of FTE
employees for the relevant period of Assemblin added to total number of employees at the end of the relevant
period of Caverion. Our employees are divided between segment, regional and unit level, with the vast majority
being employed at unit level.

219


-----

The following table shows a breakdown of our average number of employees on a Combined Group basis by
segment over the years 2021, 2022 and 2023 and over the three months ended March 31, 2024.

**As of**
**As of 31 December,**
**March 31,**
**2021** **2022** **2023** **2024**

**By Segment**
Sweden 7,139 7,352 7,672 7,728
Norway 3,074 3,093 3,311 3,364

DK + DACH 3,492 3,755 3,976 4,005

Finland + Fidelix 5,931 6,369 6,270 6,196

**Total Employees** **20,212** **20,755** **21,401** **21,457**

As installations become more complex across buildings, the technical competence of our workforce is
increasingly critical. We focus on incentivizing our staff through measures such as comprehensive training
initiatives including “Assemblin Academy”, an advanced Group-wide set of training programs with a course
offering including, among others, skills development and project management, and a line manager incentive
system. We believe that ongoing training and the development of our employees and managers is essential to our
business.

In addition, we consider employee safety a top priority. Our commitment to safety is underpinned by the
implementation of Group-wide standards for personal safety equipment and by digital incident reporting tools,
enabling simpler reporting and related follow-up by management.

When an installation project requires skills outside our technical fields, we may, from time to time, engage
subcontractors from a highly diversified and locally sourced pool of contractors (both individuals or companies,
as the case may be). Subcontractor payment rates are typically determined on a per-hour basis, however payment
can also be performed as a lump sum in relation to certain tasks (i.e., in the event in which a specific technical
capability is required which we are not providing internally, such as welding).

###### Labor Relations and Pension Issues

Our employees are covered by either a defined contribution pension plan or a defined benefit pension plan. For
more information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We may be required to make
_further contributions to our pension schemes if the value of pension fund assets is not sufficient to cover potential_
_obligations and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”_

Most of our employees are bound by collective bargaining agreements. For example, collective bargaining
agreements that we have entered into in Sweden have generally a duration of two to three years, with negotiations
for a new period currently on-going. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.

###### Information Technology

We believe that a key requirement for efficient operations and satisfactory customer delivery is a stable and
secure IT infrastructure, capable of deploying systems which are tailored to our specific operations.

Over the last few years, Assemblin has modernized its IT environment to support its decentralized organization
and use the latest cloud technology. At the Group level, there is a central IT function that, in close collaboration
with the segment IT functions, is responsible for the necessary coordination as well as developing and
administering the shared systems. The Group function is also responsible for IT security, which has grown
increasingly relevant in recent years as risks of cyber attacks, data breaches and data losses have increased. IT
units in each segment are responsible for segment-specific systems support. Our IT platform is built on
SaaS/cloud systems and we employ cloud data technology in our processes. We drive business intelligence
through a sophisticated data structure and we have an extensive digital data warehouse and a shared contract
database with e-signing procedures. We have successfully implemented the use of assembly robots for certain
tasks that are heavy and stressful for fitters, exemplifying our commitment to wellbeing at work for our

220


-----

employees. In 2023, the process of integrating previously acquired companies into Assemblin’s IT environment
continued. Several measures were also implemented to strengthen IT security, including simulated phishing,
training and extended multi-factor authentication. Further, a new modern and Group-wide employee portal was
launched gradually using features offered by Microsoft 365.

While operating our projects, we conduct large scale communications with clients and contractors based on
information systems such as building innovation modelling (BIM) systems including BIM 360 and Revit.
Assemblin Ventilation has made considerable progress in this work, particularly through its large-scale use of a
BIM-based add-on module that is used by installers to mark off the steps in an installation process so that
production can be followed up in real time, providing a better overview. This supplementary module is now used
by both Assemblin’s Swedish and Norwegian operations. In all major deliveries, digital customer platforms are
offered for the planning and review of deliveries and financing. We communicate with employees through an
intranet system that is supported by mobile applications. All of our employees have been equipped with mobile
devices, which, in addition to being used in project work, are also employed for time reporting and other HR
matters, including incident management.

With regard to solutions for customers, substantial opportunities exist to optimize the consumption of energy and
resources and/or to improve indoor climate using intelligent, BMS and IMD solutions that use modern sensor
technology (Internet of things, IoT). By adding third-party data and automatic control using AI, the ability to
remotely monitor and control large property portfolios is increased, facilitating optimal operation and low energy
consumption. We are also, as part of the Caverion Combination, initiated the process of merging the IT
infrastructure of both companies, to create an integrated network. In addition to continuing Assemblin’s history
of maintaining lean and efficient IT infrastructure, we will be able to leverage the knowledge and sophistication
of the internationally focused IT delivery in the Caverion organization.

###### Insurance

Our Group-wide insurance coverage includes policies for risks associated with our business, including general
liability, contract and property, directors’ and officers’ liability, as well as automobile, buildings and contents and
workers’ compensation policies. We believe that our insurance coverage is consistent with or above industry
standards.

###### Litigation

We provide a complex range of services to a large number of customers. As such, in the ordinary course of
business, we are subject to various administrative, legal and/or regulatory proceedings. On the basis of current
information, except as otherwise laid out below, we do not expect that the actual claims, lawsuits and other
proceedings to which we are subject, or potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings relating to matters of
which we are aware, will ultimately have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition
or liquidity. We note, however, that the outcome of legal proceedings is extremely difficult to predict with
certainty, and we offer no assurance in this regard.

###### FCO Investigation

In June 2018, Caverion reached a settlement for its part with the German Federal Office (“FCO”) in a cartel case
that had been investigated by the authority since 2014. The investigation concerned several companies providing
technical building services in Germany. Caverion Deutschland GmbH (and its predecessors) was found to have
participated in anti-competitive practices between 2005 and 2013. According to the FCO’s final decision issued
on July 3, 2018, Caverion Deutschland GmbH was imposed a fine of EUR 40.8 million. In the end of March
2020, the FCO issued its final decision on the cartel case against the other building technology companies
involved in the matter. There is a risk that civil claims may be presented against the involved companies,
including Caverion Deutschland GmbH. It is not possible to evaluate the magnitude of the risk for Caverion at
this time. Some civil claims presented against Caverion Deutschland GmbH have been settled in the years
between 2021 and 2024 in the aggregate amount of approximately EUR 20 million.

As part of Caverion’s co-operation with the authorities in the cartel matter, Caverion identified activities between
2009 and 2011 that were likely to fulfil the criteria of corruption or other criminal commitment in some of its

221


-----

client projects executed in that time. Caverion brought its findings to the attention of the authorities and supported
them in investigating the case. In the end of June 2020, the public prosecutor’s office in Munich informed
Caverion that no further investigative measures are intended and that no formal fine proceedings against
Caverion will be initiated related to those cases.

###### Breach of Contract Claim

Caverion Deutschland GmbH is currently facing a claim that has allegedly been filed with a court during April
2024. Caverion, however, has not yet been officially served with this claim. The claim, purportedly amounting
to approximately EUR 27 million, relates to an alleged breach of contract associated with a construction project
that was initiated in 2015, and completed in 2021. The parties have been in dispute over this matter over the past
several years, during which time various attempts at settlement have been made. As the court has not yet served
the claim on Caverion, Caverion has not yet been able to fully assess the claim and, as of March 31, 2024, no
additional provisions have been recognized in connection with the alleged court filing, pending further
information and analysis.

In the course of these discussions, Caverion had also prepared a claim which, at the time, was not filed. Should
the alleged claim be formally served upon Caverion, and standard procedural steps commence, Caverion intends
to defend its position and present a counterclaim relating to damages for unpaid amounts and related claims.

The initial oral hearing for the anticipated litigation is not expected to take place until late 2024. Following this
hearing, the court is likely to offer a preliminary evaluation of the claims, which may present a further opportunity
for the parties to engage in settlement discussions.

###### DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS

The following summary of certain provisions of the documents listed below governing certain of our
indebtedness does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the
underlying documents. Unless otherwise defined in this offering memorandum or unless the context otherwise
requires, terms defined in the Existing Notes Indenture, Facilities Agreements and the Intercreditor Agreement
shall have the same meanings when used in this section.

###### The Existing Notes and the Existing Notes Indenture

 Overview

On July 3, 2023, the Issuer issued €480 million of senior secured floating rate notes due 2029 (the “Existing
**Notes”) under an indenture dated as of July 3, 2023 (the “Existing Notes Indenture”), between, inter alios, the**
Issuer, Deutsche Trustee Company Limited, as trustee, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as calculation agent,
paying agent, transfer agent and security agent and Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A., as registrar. The Existing
Notes will rank pari passu with the notes offered hereby, in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement. The
Issuer used the proceeds from the Existing Notes to (i) refinance its previously outstanding indebtedness and (ii)
pay certain costs, fees and expenses.

###### Interest Rate

The Existing Notes bear interest at a rate per annum, reset quarterly, equal to the sum of (i) three-month
EURIBOR (and if that rate is less than zero, EURIBOR shall be deemed to be zero) plus (ii) 5%, and are payable,
in cash, quarterly in arrear on January 5, April 5, July 5 and October 5 of each year.

###### Maturity and Redemption

The Existing Notes mature on July 5, 2029. Prior to July 5, 2024, the Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time,
a part of the Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice at a redemption price equal to 100.00%
of the principal amount of the Notes, plus the Applicable Premium and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record
on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

Thereafter, the Issuer may redeem the Existing Notes, at its option, in whole or in part, at the principal amount
of such notes at par, in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the
redemption date. As of the date of the Offering Memorandum, the Existing Notes have not been redeemed or
repurchased and, therefore, the original principal amounts issued remain outstanding.

###### Guarantors and Security

The following security interests have been granted and are in place in relation to the Existing Notes:

(i) the issued Capital Stock of the Issuer;

(ii) the issued Capital Stock of the guarantors of the Existing Notes;

(iii) certain long-term material intra-Group loans (in respect of which the Issuer or any of the guarantors of
the Existing Notes is a creditor), with a final maturity date or intended tenor in excess of 12 months and
with a principal amount in excess of €20 million (or its equivalent in other currencies) in aggregate to a
Restricted Subsidiary as debtor (if any);

(iv) existing and future shareholder loans owed by the Issuer to its immediate Parent;

(v) certain of the Issuer’s and the guarantors of the Existing Notes’ material operating bank accounts (but
excluding any escrow, cash collateral, blocked and pooling accounts, accounts connected with any Bank
Products (as defined in the Existing Notes Indenture), accounts in connection with any receivables
financing (including discounting or factoring or similar), any guarantee or letter of credit financing, or
similar) (other than with respect to the Issuer, if any, and only to the extent that such bank accounts are
required to be secured under the Super Senior Facilities Agreements); and

229


-----

(vi) certain of the guarantors of the Existing Notes’ business mortgages (but only to the extent in existence
prior to the date of the Super Senior Facilities Agreements and to the extent they secure the Super Senior
Facilities Agreements).

The Existing Notes are secured by the same assets, and guaranteed by the same entities, that the Notes will
benefit from.

certain exceptions, our ability to:

- incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;

- pay dividends or make other distributions or purchase or redeem our stock;

- make investments or other restricted payments;

- transfer or sell assets;

- engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

- create liens on assets to secure indebtedness;

- impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Existing Notes; and

- merge or consolidate with other entities.

Each of these covenants is subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. In addition, the Existing Notes

Holding AB, Assemblin AB, Assemblin Sweden AB, Assemblin Norge AS, Fidelix Holding Oy, Assemblin AS,
Assemblin VS AB, Assemblin El AB, Assemblin Ventilation AB and Fidelix Oy and will also be guaranteed by
the same entities that will give guarantees in respect of the Notes.

The Pension Guarantee Facility are guaranteed by the Issuer, Assemblin Financing AB, Assemblin Holding AB,
Assemblin AB, Assemblin Sweden AB, Assemblin Norge AS, Fidelix Holding Oy, Assemblin AS, Assemblin VS
AB, Assemblin El AB, Assemblin Ventilation AB and Fidelix Oy and will also be guaranteed and secured on the

Each Facilities Agreement includes a requirement that, subject to certain carve-outs and exceptions in accordance
with the “agreed security principles” set out in the Facilities Agreements, each member of the Group that is, or
becomes a “material company” (as determined by the reference to the Facilities Agreements) will become a
guarantor under the Facilities Agreements within 90 days of the date of delivery of the relevant annual
consolidated or combined, as applicable, financial statements of the Issuer for the relevant fiscal year.

Furthermore, if on the last day of each financial year of the Issuer (commencing with the first complete financial
year ending December 31, 2023), the guarantors represent less than 80 per cent. of the consolidated earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of the members of the Group (subject to certain exceptions)
(the “Guarantor Coverage Test”), within 90 days of delivery of the annual financial statements for the relevant
financial year (commencing with the first complete financial year ending December 31, 2023), such other
members of the Restricted Group (subject to the agreed security principles and certain other exceptions including
that certain members of the Group may not be required to be or become a guarantor) are required to become
guarantors until the Guarantor Coverage Test is satisfied (to be calculated as if such additional guarantors had
been guarantors on the last day of the relevant financial year).

###### Security

The Super Senior Facilities will be secured by security interests granted over the same property and assets which
secure the Notes, and are expected to be secured by the Initial Post-Closing Collateral and the Subsequent PostClosing Collateral by not later than the date falling 90 days following the Issue Date or, where relevant, the later
of 90 days following the Issue Date and 30 days after Crayfish BidCo Oy obtaining title to all the issued and
outstanding shares in Caverion by posting security in the form required by Chapter 18, Section 6 of the Finnish
Companies Act (subject to the agreed security principles set out in the Facilities Agreements), as further described
under “Description of the Notes—Security.”

Each holding company of any “material company” (provided that such holding company is a member of the
Restricted Group (in each case, non wholly-owned members of the Group only to the extent there are no
applicable restrictions)) which becomes a guarantor under any Super Senior Facility is required (subject to the
agreed security principles set out in the Facilities Agreements) to grant security over the shares it holds in such
material company in favor of the Security Agent. Any Subordinated Shareholder Funding is required to be made
subject to security and to constitute Shareholder Liabilities (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement).

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, proceeds from the enforcement of the transaction security for
the Super Senior Facilities (whether or not shared with the holders of the Notes or the Guarantee Original
Lenders) will be required to be applied to repay indebtedness outstanding under:

(a) the Pension Guarantee Facility in priority to the Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities, hedging
obligations and the Notes; and

(b) the Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities, as well as certain hedging obligations, in priority to the
Notes.

###### Covenants

The Facilities Agreements contain certain of the same incurrence covenants and related definitions (with certain
adjustments) that apply to the Notes as included under the caption “Description of the Notes—Certain
_Covenants.”_

In addition, the Facilities Agreements also contain certain affirmative and negative covenants, and the Revolving
Credit and Guarantee Facilities Agreement also contains a financial covenant. Set forth below is a brief
description of such covenants, all of which are subject to customary materiality, actual knowledge or other
qualifications, exceptions and baskets.

###### Affirmative Covenants

The affirmative covenants include, among others: (i) providing certain financial information in respect of the
Restricted Group, including annual audited and quarterly financial statements, an annual budget and compliance
certificates; (ii) authorizations, (iii) compliance with laws; (iv) payment of taxes; (v) maintenance of pari passu
ranking of the Super Senior Facilities; (vi) compliance with environmental permits and laws; (vii) compliance
with sanctions and anti-corruption laws; (viii) maintenance of the Guarantor Coverage Test; (ix) further assurance

###### Negative Covenants

The negative covenants in the Super Senior Facilities are substantially the same as the negative covenants that

Certain of the incurrence covenants under the Facilities Agreements may be suspended upon (i) the occurrence
of an “initial public offering” (that does not result in a “change of control”) and the achievement of a
“consolidated net leverage ratio” of the Restricted Group is equal to or less than 3.75:1.00 (generally, pro forma
for any prepayment of the Facilities from the proceeds of such initial public offering) or (ii) a member of the
Restricted Group, the Parent or a holding company of the Group having achieved an investment grade status
(Baa3/BBB- or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group).

The Facilities Agreements also contain a “notes purchase condition” covenant, which provides, subject to certain
exceptions set out in the Facilities Agreements, that the Issuer may not, and shall procure that no other member
of the Restricted Group will, prepay, purchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire for value any of the principal
amount of the Notes prior to the scheduled repayment date. The exceptions to such covenant include, inter alia:
(i) notes purchases funded with certain permitted indebtedness under the Facilities Agreement; (ii) (provided no
“event of default” under any Super Senior Facility is continuing or would result from such note purchase) where
the “consolidated net leverage ratio” for the Restricted Group would be equal to or less than 4.00:1.00 at the time
such note purchase is contractually committed (pro forma to take account of the relevant notes purchase); (iii)
(provided no event of default under any Super Senior Facility is continuing or would result from such note
purchase) note purchases that do not exceed 50 per cent. of the aggregate face value of the Notes in existence at
the Issue Date or incurred afterwards (and any permitted refinancing thereof); or (iv) the Revolving Credit
Facility or Pension Guarantee Facility (as applicable) is cancelled (and if applicable prepaid) in the same or

235


-----

greater proportion as the proportion of the note purchase to the aggregate face value of the Notes then
outstanding.

###### Financial Covenant

The Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities Agreement requires the Issuer to comply with a consolidated
“senior secured net leverage” financial covenant.” The financial covenant will be tested quarterly on a rolling
basis, generally, subject to (i) the first test date falling on the date that is the end of the second fiscal quarter date
after the Issue Date and (ii) the Revolving Credit Facility being at least 40 per cent. cash drawn on the relevant
test date. The finance parties under the Pension Guarantee Facility Agreement do not benefit from the financial
covenant.

The Issuer shall be permitted to prevent or cure breaches of the financial covenant by applying a “cure” amount
(generally, amounts received by the Issuer in cash pursuant to any new equity or permitted shareholder
subordinated debt), including as if “consolidated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization”
had been reduced by such amount. There shall be no requirement to apply any such cure amount in prepayment
of the Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities. No more than four different cure amounts may be taken into
account prior to the original termination date of the Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities Agreement and
cure amounts in consecutive financial quarters will not be permitted.

###### Events of Default

The Facilities Agreements provide for some of the same events of default, with certain adjustments, as those
applicable for the Notes as set forth in the section entitled “Description of the Notes—Events of Default.” In
addition, the Super Senior Facilities provide for certain customary events of default, all of which are subject to
customary materiality, legal reservations, perfection requirements and other qualifications, exceptions, baskets
and/or grace periods, as appropriate, comprising without limitation: (i) breach of the financial covenant subject
to possibilities to cure the financial covenant breach; (ii) representations or warranties found to be untrue or
misleading when made or deemed repeated subject to a 20 business day grace period; (iii) unlawfulness and
invalidity subject to a 20 business day grace period; (iv) failure to comply with a material term of the Intercreditor
Agreement subject to a 20 business day grace period; and (v) repudiation and rescission of the finance documents
subject to a 20 business day grace period.

No default or event of default (other than a non-payment default under the Pension Guarantee Facility
Agreement) shall be deemed to have occurred or be continuing under the Pension Guarantee Facility Agreement
unless a corresponding default or event of default has occurred and is continuing under the Revolving Credit and
Guarantee Facilities Agreement (or any replacement facility) for as long as any such agreement remains in force
and (ii) any such default or event of default (other than in relation to non-payment default or event of default
under the Pension Guarantee Facility Agreement) of the Pension Guarantee Agreement shall be continuing for
as long as the corresponding default or event of default is continuing under the Revolving Credit and Guarantee
Facilities Agreement (or any replacement facility) for as long as any such agreement remain in force.

###### Governing Law

The Facilities Agreements and the additional facility notice(s) are governed by English law, provided that the
events of default, incurrence covenants and related definitions for the Notes included (with certain adjustments)
in the Facilities Agreements are interpreted in accordance with the law of the State of New York.

###### Intercreditor Agreement

To establish the relative rights of certain of our creditors under certain of our financing arrangements, the Issuer,
the immediate subsidiary of the Issuer and the immediate holding company to the Issuer (the “Original
Shareholder Creditor”) have entered into an intercreditor agreement (as amended and/or amended and restated
from time to time) (the “Intercreditor Agreement”), together with the RCF Agent, the Pension Guarantee
Facility Agent, the Original Lenders and the Mandated Lead Arrangers, the trustee for the holders of the Existing
Notes (the “Existing Senior Secured Notes Trustee”) and the Security Agent. The Trustee for the holders of the
Notes will accede to the Intercreditor Agreement on the Issue Date as Future Pari Passu Debt Representative.

236


-----

By accepting a Note, the relevant holder thereof shall be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the terms and
conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement and shall be deemed to have authorized the Trustee to enter into the
Intercreditor Agreement on its behalf as Future Pari Passu Debt Representative.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions, among others, that will be contained in the
Intercreditor Agreement and which relate to the rights and obligations of the holders of the Notes. It does not
restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety. As such, you are urged to read the Intercreditor Agreement
because it, and not the description that follows, defines certain rights of the holders of the Notes.

Unless expressly stated otherwise in the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of a conflict between the terms of
the Facilities Agreements, the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, the provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement will prevail.

###### Overview

The Intercreditor Agreement will set out, among other things:

- the relative ranking of certain debt of the Issuer and its “restricted subsidiaries” (together, the “Group”)
in respect of “Pension Guarantee Facility Liabilities,” “RCF and Guarantee Facilities Liabilities,”
“Credit Facility Liabilities,” “Senior Secured Notes Liabilities,” “Future Pari Passu Debt
**Liabilities,” “Super Senior Hedging Liabilities,” “Pari Passu Hedging Liabilities” and “Future**
**Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities” (each as defined below);**

- the relative ranking of certain security granted by certain members of the Group for the benefit of certain
creditors under certain of our financing arrangements;

- when payments can be made in respect of certain indebtedness of the Group;

- when enforcement action (including acceleration and/or demand for payment and certain similar actions)
(“Enforcement Action”) can be taken in respect of the “Transaction Security” (as defined below);

- the requirement to turnover amounts received from enforcement of the Transaction Security and certain
guarantees provided by certain members of the Group;

- when the Transaction Security and guarantee(s) issued by certain members of the Group are released to
permit an enforcement sale;

- the circumstances under which creditors’ claims (including the claims of holders of the Notes against the
Issuer) might be required to be transferred to third parties or released to assist in enforcement; and

- the order for applying proceeds from the enforcement of the Transaction Security, certain guarantees and
other amounts received by the Security Agent.

###### Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness

The Intercreditor Agreement contains customary provisions regulating certain additional indebtedness permitted
to be incurred by members of the Group and which is contemplated to be secured by the documents creating
security (including the Collateral) (the “Transaction Security”) granted by certain members of the Group
(together, the “Transaction Security Documents”).

Such additional indebtedness may either, with respect to the Transaction Security (and the proceeds thereof): (i)
be in the form of loans, credit or debt facilities or notes (among other things) and have equivalent rights to the
rights of the holders of the Notes under the Intercreditor Agreement, in which case it will vote in, and share in
the proceeds of, enforcement of the Transaction Security with the same class of creditors as the holders of Notes
(such indebtedness, “Future Pari Passu Debt” and, the holders of such indebtedness, “Future Pari Passu Debt
**Creditors”); (ii) be in the form of a “credit facility” ranking senior to the liabilities in respect of the Notes with**
respect to the proceeds of enforcement of the Transaction Security, in which case it will vote in, and share in the
proceeds of, enforcement of Transaction Security with the lenders under the Revolving Credit and Guarantee
Facilities and any “Super Senior Hedging Agreements” (as defined below) (such additional credit facilities,

237


-----

solely for the purposes of this description of the Intercreditor Agreement, the “Credit Facilities” and, the lenders
of such indebtedness, the “Additional Credit Facility Lenders”); (iii) be in the form of a “pension guarantee
facility” ranking senior to the liabilities in respect of the Super Senior Lenders with respect to the proceeds of
enforcement of the Transaction Security, in which case it will vote in, and share in the proceeds of, enforcement
of Transaction Security with the lenders under the Pension Facilities (such additional pension guarantee facilities,
solely for the purposes of this description of the Intercreditor Agreement, the “Additional Pension Facilities”
and, the lenders of such indebtedness, the “Additional Pension Guarantee Facility Lenders”); or (iv) to the
extent that it benefits from Transaction Security, be in the form of loans, credit or debt facilities or notes (among
other things) and rank junior to the liabilities in respect of the Notes, in which case it will share in the proceeds
of enforcement of the Transaction Security expressed to secure it on a junior basis to the holders of the Notes
(such indebtedness, “Future Senior Subordinated Debt,” and the lenders or holders of such indebtedness, the
“Future Senior Subordinated Creditors”).

###### Hedging Transactions

The Intercreditor Agreement contains provisions that permit certain members of the Group to enter into hedging
agreements with certain hedge counterparties, which may also be secured by the Transaction Security.

The hedging agreements may either, with respect to the Transaction Security (and the proceeds thereof): (i) be
secured on a senior basis to the liabilities in respect of the Notes with respect to the proceeds of enforcement of
the Transaction Security, in which case it will vote in, and share in the proceeds of, enforcement of the
Transaction Security with the lenders and creditors under the Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities (such
hedging agreements, the “Super Senior Hedging Agreements,” and, the hedge counterparties in respect thereof,
the “Super Senior Hedging Banks”); or (ii) have equivalent rights to the rights of the holders of the Notes under
the Intercreditor Agreement, in which case it will vote in, and share in the proceeds of, enforcement of the
Transaction Security with the same class of creditors as the holders of Notes and the holders of any Future Pari
Passu Debt (such hedging agreements, the “Pari Passu Hedging Agreements,” and, the hedge counterparties in
respect thereof, the “Pari Passu Hedging Banks” and, together with the Super Senior Hedging Banks, the
“Hedging Banks”).

###### Intra-Group Debt and Shareholder Debt

None of the Issuer, any of its restricted subsidiaries or any shareholder of a member of the Group which is not
otherwise party to (1) a document creating security in favor of any of the “Super Super Senior Creditors” (as
defined below), “Super Senior Creditors” (as defined below), “Senior Secured Creditors” (as defined below)
or the Future Senior Subordinated Creditors or (2) the debt documents thereby secured, will be party to the
Intercreditor Agreement save for: (i) the immediate shareholder of the Issuer (and any other person who accedes
or otherwise becomes party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a shareholder creditor) in respect of any existing
or future loan made to the Issuer or any of its restricted subsidiaries (each a “Shareholder Creditor,” and each
such loan, the “Shareholder Debt Liabilities”); and (ii) certain members of the Group that lend (each an
“Intragroup Lender”) to certain other members of the Group that will accede or otherwise become a party to
the Intercreditor Agreement with respect to such loan or indebtedness which is (when aggregated with all other
loans or indebtedness between such member of the Group and such other member of the Group) in an amount in
excess of €20 million and, in the case of each such loan or indebtedness, (or will be) outstanding for more than
twelve months (the “Intra-Group Liabilities”) (each an “Obligor” and, together, the “Obligors”).

The Intercreditor Agreement contains subordination provisions relating to any Intra-Group Liabilities as well as
the Shareholder Debt Liabilities. However, Obligors will not be prohibited from making payments in respect of
any Intra-Group Liabilities until an “acceleration event” has occurred and is continuing under any of the
Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities Agreement, the Indenture, any Credit Facility, any Future Pari Passu
Debt or any Future Senior Subordinated Debt.

###### Security Agent

There will be a single security agent appointed to act at all times on behalf of (i) the lenders under the Pension
Guarantee Facility Agreement (together, the “Pension Guarantee Lenders”) and any Additional Pension

238


-----

Guarantee Facility Lenders (together, the “Super Super Senior Creditors”), (ii) the lenders under the Revolving
Credit and Guarantee Facilities and any Additional Credit Facility Lender (together, the “RCF and Guarantee
**Lenders”), any Super Senior Hedging Banks and any Additional Credit Facility Lenders (together, the “Super**
**Senior Creditors”), (ii) the holders of the Notes, any Pari Passu Hedging Banks and any Future Pari Passu Debt**
Creditors (collectively, the “Senior Secured Creditors” and, together with the Super Senior Creditors and the
Super Super Senior Creditors, the “Senior Creditors,” and the debt owing to the Senior Creditors, the “Senior
**Debt”) and (iii) any Future Senior Subordinated Creditors.**

###### Ranking and Priority

 Priority of Indebtedness

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the liabilities of the Obligors, as the case may be, in respect of the
Pension Facilities (the “Pension Guarantee Facility Liabilities”) and any Additional Pension Facilities
(together with the Pension Guarantee Facility Liabilities, the “Super Super Senior Liabilities”), the Revolving
Credit and Guarantee Facilities (the “RCF and Guarantee Facilities Liabilities”), any Credit Facilities (the
“Credit Facility Liabilities”), the Existing Notes and any additional notes issued from time to time under the
Existing Indenture (together, the “Existing Senior Secured Notes,” and the liabilities in respect thereof, the
“Senior Secured Notes Liabilities”), the Future Pari Passu Debt (which shall include the Notes and any
additional notes issued from time to time under the Indenture (the “Future Pari Passu Debt Liabilities”)), the
amounts owing to the Super Senior Hedging Banks under the Super Senior Hedging Agreements (the “Super
**Senior Hedging Liabilities” and, together with the RCF and Guarantee Facilities Liabilities and the Credit**
Facility Liabilities, the “Super Senior Liabilities”) and the amounts owing to the Pari Passu Hedging Banks
under the Pari Passu Hedging Agreements (the “Pari Passu Hedging Liabilities” and, together with the Super
Senior Hedging Liabilities, the “Hedging Liabilities”), certain customary costs and expenses of the Existing
Senior Secured Notes Trustee (the “Senior Secured Trustee Liabilities”), amounts owing to the Security Agent,
and amounts owing to the representatives for the creditors under the Super Super Senior Liabilities, the RCF and
Guarantee Facilities Liabilities, the Credit Facility Liabilities, the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the Future
Pari Passu Debt Liabilities and the Pari Passu Hedging Liabilities, respectively, ranks equally (without preference
among them) in right and priority of payment and in priority to the liabilities of the Obligors, as the case may be,
in respect of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt (the “Future Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities”), the
Intra-Group Liabilities and the Shareholder Debt Liabilities.

The Future Senior Subordinated Debt ranks in priority to the Intra-Group Liabilities and the Shareholder Debt
Liabilities.

The Intercreditor Agreement does not rank any of liabilities and/or obligations owed any person who is not the
Issuer or a restricted subsidiary of the Issuer.

###### Priority of Transaction Security

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Transaction Security created pursuant to the Transaction Security
Documents shall rank and secure the following liabilities in the following order (but only, in each case, to the
extent that such Transaction Security is expressed to secure those liabilities):

- **first, pari passu between themselves and without any preference between them, the Super Super Senior**
Liabilities, the RCF and Guarantee Facilities Liabilities, the Credit Facility Liabilities, the Super Senior
Hedging Liabilities, the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the Future Pari Passu Debt Liabilities, certain
customary costs and expenses of the Senior Secured Trustee and the Pari Passu Hedging Liabilities; and

- **second,** _pari passu_ between themselves and without any preference between them, the Future Senior
Subordinated Debt Liabilities.

The proceeds from the enforcement of the Transaction Security are to be applied as described below under the
caption “—Application of Proceeds/Waterfall.”

239


-----

###### Intra-Group Liabilities and Shareholder Debt Liabilities

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Intra-Group Liabilities and the Shareholder Debt Liabilities are
postponed and subordinated to the liabilities owed by the Obligors to the Super Super Senior Creditors, the Super
Senior Creditors, the Senior Secured Creditors and the Future Senior Subordinated Creditors (collectively, the
“Primary Creditors”).

###### Restrictions on Payments

 Super Super Senior Creditors, Super Senior Creditors and Senior Secured Creditors

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Obligors may make payments in respect of the Super Super Senior
Liabilities, RCF and Guarantee Facilities Liabilities, the Credit Facility Liabilities, the Senior Secured Notes
Liabilities and the Future Pari Passu Debt Liabilities, respectively, at any time in accordance with their respective
terms.

###### Future Senior Subordinated Creditors

Prior to the date of discharge of all Senior Debt (the “Senior Debt Discharge Date”), except with the prior
consent of an “Instructing Group” (as defined below), neither the Issuer nor any member of the Group may
make payments in respect of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities without the consent of the
“Relevant Representative” (as defined below) except for the following:

(1) if:

(a) the payment is:

(i) any of the principal or interest (including capitalized interest and default interest) amount
of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities which is either (1) not prohibited from

Facilities finance arrangement, the Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities Agreement
or any Credit Facility finance agreement, the Indenture or any Future Pari Passu Debt
finance agreement or (2) paid on or after the final maturity date of the Future Senior
Subordinated Debt Liabilities (provided that (x) the scheduled maturity date of such Future
Senior Subordinated Debt is, at the first date of incurrence of such Future Senior
Subordinated Debt, no earlier than the date falling six months after the original scheduled
maturity date of the Notes issued on or about the date of the Intercreditor Agreement (it
being acknowledged that such Future Senior Subordinated Debt may have customary
optional redemption, change of control, asset sale and/or other customary mandatory
redemption provisions) and (y) such maturity date is no earlier than that contained in the
relevant Future Senior Subordinated Debt documents as of the first date of incurrence of
any Future Senior Subordinated Debt); or

(ii) any other amount in respect of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities which is not
an amount of principal or capitalized interest and default interest on the Future Senior
Subordinated Debt Liabilities accrued due and payable in cash in accordance with the terms
of the relevant debt documents for the Future Senior Subordinated Debt (together, the
“Future Senior Subordinated Debt Documents”), additional amounts payable as a result of
the tax gross-up provisions relating to the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities and

Documents;

(b) no notice delivered pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement blocking payments in
respect of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities (a “Payment Blockage Notice”) is
outstanding; and

(c) no payment default under the Pension Guarantee Facility, Revolving and Guarantee Credit Facility,
any Credit Facility and no payment default of €1,000,000 (or its equivalent) or more in respect of

(3) the payment is a “Permitted Post-Payment Blockage Payment” (as defined below).

(4) the payment is in respect of costs, commissions, taxes, consent fees and expenses incurred in respect of
(or reasonably incidental to) the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Documents (including in relation to
any reporting or listing requirements under the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Documents); or

(or reasonably incidental to) any refinancing of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt in compliance with
the Intercreditor Agreement, the Pension Guarantee Facility Agreement, any Additional Pension Facilities
finance arrangement, the Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities Agreement and any Credit Facility
finance agreement, the Indenture and any Future Pari Passu Debt finance agreement;

(6) the payment is in respect of certain customary costs and expenses payable to a “Future Senior
**Subordinated Debt Representative” (as defined below); or**

(7) the payment is permitted or otherwise not prohibited by Pension Guarantee Facility Agreement, any
Additional Pension Facilities finance arrangement, the Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities
Agreement, any Credit Facility finance agreement, the Indenture and any Future Pari Passu Debt finance
agreement.

On or after the Senior Debt Discharge Date, the Obligors may make payments to the Future Senior Subordinated
Creditors in respect of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities in accordance with the Future Senior
Subordinated Debt Documents.

###### Payment Block—Future Senior Subordinated Debt

Prior to the Senior Debt Discharge Date, if a Senior Debt Payment Default has occurred and is continuing, all
payments in respect of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities (other than any payment consented to by
the “Majority Super Super Senior Creditors,” the “Majority Super Senior Creditors” and the “Majority
**Senior Secured Creditors” (each as defined below) and certain specified exceptions) are suspended.**

Prior to the Senior Debt Discharge Date, if an event of default (other than a Senior Debt Payment Default) under
the finance documents in respect of the Senior Debt (a “Senior Default”) has occurred and is continuing, and
either the Pension Guarantee Facility Agent, the creditor representative for any Pension Guarantee Facility, the
RCF Agent, the creditor representative for any Credit Facility (together the “Senior Agents” and each a “Senior
**Agent”), the Existing Senior Secured Notes Trustee, the Trustee or a creditor representative of Future Pari Passu**
Debt (as the case may be) (each a “Relevant Representative”) has delivered a Payment Blockage Notice to the
Issuer, the Security Agent and creditor representative of the Future Senior Subordinated Creditors (the “Future
**Senior Subordinated Debt Representative”), all payments in respect of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt**
Liabilities (other than those consented to by the Majority Super Super Senior Creditors, Majority Super Senior
Creditors and Majority Senior Secured Creditors and certain specified exceptions) are suspended until the earliest
of:

(1) the date on which there is a waiver, remedy or cure of such Senior Default in accordance with the relevant
finance documents;

(2) the date on which a default under the Future Senior Subordinated Debt occurs for failure to pay principal
at the original scheduled maturity of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt;

(3) the date falling 179 days after the receipt by the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Representative of the
Payment Blockage Notice;

241


-----

(4) if a Future Senior Subordinated Debt Standstill Period (as defined below) is in effect at any time after
delivery of a Payment Blockage Notice, the date on which that Standstill Period expires;

(5) the date on which the relevant Senior Default is no longer continuing and, if the relevant Senior Debt has
been accelerated, such acceleration has been rescinded (and if such acceleration consisted solely of
declaring the relevant debt payable on demand such rescission can be effected by the relevant majority
creditors in respect of the relevant debt);

(6) the date on which the Relevant Representative which issued the Payment Blockage Notice (and, if at such
time a Senior Default is continuing (other than in relation to the Senior Debt in respect of which such
notice was given), the Relevant Representative(s) in respect of that other Senior Debt) delivers a notice
to the Issuer, the Security Agent and the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Representative cancelling that
Payment Blockage Notice;

(7) the Senior Debt Discharge Date; and

(8) the date on which the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Representative or the Security Agent takes any
Enforcement Action which it is permitted to take in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.

Unless the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Representative waives this requirement: (i) no new Payment
Blockage Notice may be served by a Relevant Representative unless 360 days have elapsed since the delivery of
the immediately prior Payment Blockage Notice; and (ii) no Payment Blockage Notice may be served in reliance
on a Senior Default more than 60 days after the date that the Relevant Representative received notice of that
Senior Default.

The Relevant Representative may only serve one Payment Blockage Notice with respect to the same event or set
of circumstances. Subject to the immediately preceding paragraph, this shall not affect the right of the Relevant
Representatives to issue a Payment Blockage Notice in respect of any other event or set of circumstances.

No Payment Blockage Notice may be served by a Relevant Representative in respect of a Senior Default which
had been notified to each of them at the time at which an earlier Payment Blockage Notice was issued.

###### Cure of Payment Block—Future Senior Subordinated Creditors

If:

(a) at any time following the issue of a Payment Blockage Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Debt Payment
Default, that Payment Blockage Notice ceases to be outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the Senior
Debt Payment Default ceases to be continuing; and

(b) the relevant Obligor then promptly pays to the Future Senior Subordinated Creditors an amount equal to
any payments which had accrued under any Future Senior Subordinated Debt Documents and which
would have otherwise been entitled to make but for that Payment Blockage Notice or Senior Debt
Payment Default (a “Permitted Post-Payment Blockage Payment”), then any event of default which
may have occurred as a result of that suspension of payments shall be waived and any “Future Senior
**Subordinated Debt Enforcement Notice” (as defined below) which may have been issued as a result of**
that event of default shall be waived, in each case without any further action being required on the part of
the Future Senior Subordinated Creditors.

###### Enforcement Action

 Permitted enforcement by Future Senior Subordinated Creditors

Prior to the Senior Debt Discharge Date, neither the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Representative nor the
Future Senior Subordinated Creditors may take or require the taking of an Enforcement Action with respect to
the Future Senior Subordinated Debt without the prior consent of or as required by an “Instructing Group” (as
defined below), except if:

242


-----

(1) an event of default has occurred under a Future Senior Subordinated Debt finance agreement resulting
from failure to pay the principal amount of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities at final
maturity; or

(2)

(a) an event of default under a Future Senior Subordinated Debt finance agreement is continuing (the
“Relevant Future Senior Subordinated Debt Event of Default”);

(b) each Relevant Representative has received notice of the Relevant Future Senior Subordinated Debt
Event of Default from the relevant Future Senior Subordinated Debt Representative;

(c) a Future Senior Subordinated Debt Standstill Period (as defined below) has expired; and

(d) the Relevant Future Senior Subordinated Debt Event of Default is continuing at the end of the
relevant Standstill Period,

_provided that in the case of paragraph (2) above only, no such Enforcement Action may be taken if the Security_
Agent is acting in accordance with the instructions of the Instructing Group to take steps for Enforcement and
such proposed Enforcement Action in relation to the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Documents might
reasonably be likely to adversely affect such Enforcement Action by the Security Agent.

###### Standstill on enforcement by Future Senior Subordinated Creditors

A “Future Senior Subordinated Standstill Period” shall mean the period starting on the date that the Future
Senior Subordinated Debt Representative serves an enforcement notice (a “Future Senior Subordinated Debt
**Enforcement Notice”) on the Relevant Representatives until the earliest of:**

(a) 179 days after such date;

(b) the date on which the Security Agent takes any Enforcement Action, provided that (i) if the Future Senior
Subordinated Standstill Period ends pursuant to this paragraph (b), the Future Senior Subordinated
Creditors may only take the same Enforcement Action against the same entity as is taken by the Security
Agent and may not take any other action against any other member of the Group and (ii) Enforcement
Action, for the purposes of this paragraph (b), shall not include action taken to preserve or protect any
security as opposed to realize it;

(c) the date on which an insolvency event occurs in respect of a particular Obligor owing Future Senior
Subordinated Debt Liabilities and against whom Enforcement Action is to be taken;

(d) the date on which an event of default under a Future Senior Subordinated Debt Document occurs for
failure to pay principal at the original scheduled maturity of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt; and

(e) the expiration of any other Future Senior Subordinated Standstill Period which was outstanding at the
date that the current Future Senior Subordinated Standstill Period commenced (other than as a result of a
cure, waiver or other permitted remedy thereof).

###### Standstill on enforcement by Super Super Senior Creditors

A “Pension Guarantee Standstill Period” shall mean the period starting on the date that the creditor
representative for any Pension Guarantee Facility serves an enforcement notice on the Relevant Representatives
until the earliest of:

(a) 120 days if they take enforcement action due to a payment default;

(b) 150 days if they take enforcement action due to any other event of default;

(c) the Majority Super Senior Secured Creditors and the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have given their
prior consent; or

243


-----

(d) the date on which an insolvency event occurs in respect of a particular Obligor owing Super Super Senior
Liabilities and against whom Enforcement Action is to be taken.

###### Composition of the instructing creditor groups

The Intercreditor Agreement generally provides that the Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the
Transaction Security unless instructed otherwise by an Instructing Group. Each of the creditor groups referred to
below under this caption constitute an “Instructing Group” in relation to instructions with respect to any
Enforcement.

Prior to the date upon which all amounts (actual or contingent) owing under the (a) Revolving Credit and
Guarantee Facility and each other Credit Facility are fully discharged and paid in full and all commitments
thereunder are irrevocably cancelled (such date, the “RCF/Credit/Guarantee Facility Discharge Date”), (b)
the Pension Guarantee Facility and each other Additional Pension Guarantee Facility are fully discharged and
paid in full and all commitments thereunder are irrevocably cancelled (such date, the “Pension Guarantee
**Facility Discharge Date”) and (c) Super Senior Hedging Liabilities are fully discharged and paid in full (“Super**
**Senior Hedging Discharge Date”), in relation to instructions with respect to any Enforcement, the Security**
Agent will act on the instructions of, generally:

(1) the Pension Guarantee Lenders and any Additional Pension Guarantee Facility Lenders whose credit

participations represent more than 66 2⁄3 per cent. of the aggregate credit participations of all Pension
Guarantee Lenders and Additional Pension Guarantee Facility Lenders (the “Majority Super Super
**Senior Creditors”);**

(2) the RCF and Guarantee Lenders, the Additional Credit Facility Lenders and the Super Senior Hedging
Banks whose credit participations represent more than 50 per cent. of the aggregate credit participations
of all RCF and Guarantee Lenders, Additional Credit Facility Lenders and Super Senior Hedging Banks
(the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”); and/or

(3) the holders of the Existing Senior Secured Notes, the Future Pari Passu Debt Creditors and the Pari Passu
Hedging Banks whose aggregate credit participations represent more than 50 per cent. of the aggregate
credit participations of all holders of Existing Senior Secured Notes, Future Pari Passu Debt Creditors and
Pari Passu Hedging Banks (the “Majority Senior Secured Creditors”),

in each case subject to a consultation period referred to under the caption “—Consultation” below and provided
that such instructions are consistent with the “Security Enforcement Principles” (as defined below) as generally
described below under the caption “—Security Enforcement Principles”

Following the RCF/Credit/Guarantee Facility Discharge Date, the Pension Guarantee Facility Discharge Date
and the Super Senior Hedging Discharge Date but prior to the Senior Debt Discharge Date, the Security Agent
will act on the instructions of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors which would, solely for this purpose, include
all Super Senior Hedging Banks (if any).

Following the Senior Debt Discharge Date, the Security Agent will act on the instructions of the “Majority Senior
Subordinated Creditors” (being, at any time, those Future Senior Subordinated Creditors whose credit
participations at that time aggregate more than 50 per cent. of the aggregate credit participations of all Future
Senior Subordinated Creditors).

###### Consultation

Prior to giving any instructions to the Security Agent to commence enforcement of all or part of the Transaction
Security and/or the requesting of a “distressed disposal” and/or the release or disposal of claims or Transaction
Security on a distressed disposal (each an “Enforcement”), the relevant creditor representative(s) of the Majority
Super Super Senior Creditors, the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors shall
first notify the Security Agent and the creditor representative for each of the, Super Super Senior Creditors, the
Super Senior Creditors and each of the Senior Secured Creditors that the applicable Transaction Security has
become enforceable.

244


-----

As soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of such a notice instructing the Security Agent to solicit
instructions to enforce the Transaction Security or take any other Enforcement Action given by (subject to the
Super Super Senior Creditors being entitled to take Enforcement Actions as generally described below under the
caption “—Standstill on enforcement by Super Super Senior Creditors”) the Majority Super Super Senior
Creditors, the Majority Super Senior Creditors and/or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (as the case may
be), the Security Agent shall distribute such notice to the relevant addressees promptly upon receipt, following
which, each Senior Agent (acting on the instructions of the Majority Super Senior Creditors and/or the Majority
Super Super Senior Creditors (as the case may be)), the Existing Senior Secured Notes Trustee, the Trustee and
the creditor representative(s) of the Future Pari Passu Debt Creditors will consult in good faith with each other
and the Security Agent for a period of 15 days from the date such notice is received by such persons (or such
shorter period as the relevant parties may agree) (the “Consultation Period”) with a view to coordinating the
instructions to be given by an Instructing Group and agreeing an enforcement strategy.

Generally, no such consultation shall be required (and an Instructing Group shall be entitled to give any
instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security or take any other Enforcement Action prior
to the end of the Consultation Period, in each case provided such instructions comply with the Security
Enforcement Principles (“Qualifying Instructions”)) where:

(a) the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an insolvency event affecting the Original
Shareholder Creditor, the Issuer or any Obligor (owing liabilities to any Primary Creditor or the Issuer)
or any “significant subsidiary” (as applicable) (each a “Relevant Company”); or

(b) the Majority Super Super Senior Creditors, the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior
Secured Creditors determine in good faith (and notify the creditor representatives of each of the other
Pension Guarantee Lenders, the Additional Pension Guarantee Facility Lenders, RCF and Guarantee
Lenders, Additional Credit Facility Lenders, Super Senior Hedging Banks, the holders of the Existing
Senior Secured Notes, the Future Pari Passu Debt Creditors and the Security Agent) that any delay caused
by such consultation could reasonably be expected to reduce the amount likely to be realized to a level
such that (following application thereof in accordance with the “Payments Waterfall” (as defined below)
described below under the caption “—Application of Proceeds/Waterfall”) Super Super Senior Liabilities
and the Super Senior Liabilities would not be discharged in full and in this case any instructions is limited
to those necessary to protect or preserve the interests of the Senior Secured Creditors on behalf of which
the relevant Instructing Group is acting and the Security Agent shall act in accordance with the instructions
first received.

If, following the Consultation Period, the Majority Super Super Senior Creditors, the Majority Super Senior
Creditors and/or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have agreed on an enforcement strategy, the Security
Agent shall be instructed to implement the same.

Subject to the paragraph below, in the event that conflicting instructions are received from either Instructing
Group by the end of (or following) the Consultation Period, the Security Agent shall enforce the Transaction
Security and/or refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security and/or take the relevant other Enforcement
Action in accordance with the instructions provided by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, provided that any
such instructions are Qualifying Instructions and the terms of all instructions received by the Majority Super
Super Senior Creditors and/or Majority Super Senior Creditors during the Consultation Period shall be deemed
revoked.

If, prior to the:

(a) RCF/Credit/Guarantee Facility Discharge Date, either (x) the Super Senior Liabilities have not been
repaid in full within six months of the end of the Consultation Period, (y) the Security Agent has not
commenced any Enforcement (or any transaction in lieu) or other Enforcement Action within three
months of the end of the Consultation Period or (z) at any time (whether before or after the end of the
Consultation Period) an insolvency event has occurred with respect to a Relevant Company and the
Security Agent has not commenced any Enforcement (or any transaction in lieu) or other Enforcement

245

###### Security Enforcement Principles

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that enforcement of the Transaction Security must be conducted in
accordance with the “Security Enforcement Principles,” which principles shall include the following:

(a) It shall be the primary and over-riding aim of any Enforcement of the Transaction Security to maximize,
so far as is consistent with a prompt and expeditious realization of value from Enforcement of the
Transaction Security, and in a manner consistent with the Intercreditor Agreement, the recovery of the
Pension Guarantee Lenders and Additional Pension Guarantee Facility Lenders, the RCF and Guarantee
Lenders and Additional Credit Facility Lenders, the Hedging Banks, the holders of the Existing Senior
Secured Notes and their representatives, the Future Pari Passu Debt Creditors and their representatives
and the Future Senior Subordinated Creditors (to the extent the Transaction Security is expressed to secure
such debt) and their representatives (the “Security Enforcement Objective”).

(b) Without prejudice to the Security Enforcement Objective, the Transaction Security is enforced and any
other action as to Enforcement is taken such that either:

(i) all proceeds of Enforcement are received by the Security Agent in money (or substantially all cash)
for distribution in accordance with the Payments Waterfall; or

(ii) sufficient proceeds of Enforcement is received by the Security Agent in money to ensure that when
the proceeds are applied in accordance with the Payments Waterfall, first, the Super Super Senior
Liabilities are repaid and discharged in full (unless the Majority Super Super Senior Creditors
agree otherwise) and second, the Super Senior Liabilities are repaid and discharged in full (unless
the Majority Super Senior Creditors agree otherwise).

(c) On:

(i) a proposed Enforcement of any of the Transaction Security over assets other than shares in a
member of the Group, where the aggregate book value of such assets exceeds €5.0 million (or its
equivalent); or

(ii) a proposed Enforcement of any of the Transaction Security over some or all of the shares in a
member of the Group over which Transaction Security exists,

the Security Agent shall (unless such enforcement is made pursuant to a public auction or process
supervised by a court of law which makes a determination as to value) obtain an opinion from a reputable

246


-----

internationally recognized investment bank or international accounting firm or other reputable, third-party
professional firm that is regularly engaged in providing valuations of businesses or assets similar or
comparable to those charged under the Transaction Security to be enforced (a “Financial Advisor”) to
opine as expert:

(A) on the optimal method of enforcing the Transaction Security so as to achieve the Security
Enforcement Objective and maximize the recovery of any such Enforcement Action;

(B) that the proceeds received from Enforcement are fair from a financial point of view after
taking into account all relevant circumstances; and

(C) that such sale is otherwise in accordance with the Security Enforcement Objective.

(d) The Security Agent shall be under no obligation to appoint a Financial Advisor or to seek the advice of a
Financial Advisor, unless expressly required to do so by the Intercreditor Agreement or any other
provision of the Intercreditor Agreement. It is understood that the Financial Advisor may limit its liability
in respect of the opinion referred to in (c) above to the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement.

Generally, the Security Enforcement Principles may be amended, varied or waived with the prior written consent
of the Issuer, the Majority Super Senior Creditors, the requisite Senior Secured Creditors; and the requisite Future
Pari Passu Debt Creditors (as determined under the relevant finance documents for such Future Pari Passu Debt
or, if not addressed thereunder, with the approval of at least a majority of such Future Pari Passu Debt Liabilities).

###### Turnover

The Intercreditor Agreement will also provide that, subject to certain exceptions, if any Primary Creditor receives
or recovers the proceeds of any enforcement of any Transaction Security applied other than in accordance with
the Payments Waterfall, it shall:

- in relation to receipts or recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off: (i) hold that amount on
trust for the Security Agent and separate from other assets, property or funds and promptly pay that
amount or an amount equal to that amount to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and (ii) promptly pay an amount equal to the amount (if any) by
which receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities owed to the Security Agent for application in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

- in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an amount
equal to that receipt or recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

###### Disposals

 Non-distressed Disposals

Generally, in circumstances where a disposal or certain other specified transactions (including mergers,
reorganizations, an IPO and other transactions or arrangements) are not being effected pursuant to a “Distress
**Event” (as defined below) (a disposal effected pursuant to a Distress Event being a “Distressed Disposal”) and**
are otherwise permitted by the terms of the Indenture, the finance documents for the Pension Guarantee Facilities,
any Additional Pension Facilities, Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facility, any Credit Facilities and any Future
Pari Passu Debt and the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide

248


-----

execute any related documents); and (ii) if the relevant asset consists of shares in the capital of an Obligor, to
release the Transaction Security or any other claim in respect of the liabilities secured by the Transaction Security
over the assets of that Obligor and the shares in and assets of any of its subsidiaries (and in connection with such
release, execute any related documents).

###### Distressed Disposals

Where a Distressed Disposal of an asset is being effected, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the
Security Agent is authorized:

(a) to release the Transaction Security, or any other claim over the relevant asset;

(b) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of an Obligor, to release: (i) that Obligor
and any subsidiary of that Obligor from all or any part of its “borrowing liabilities” and “guarantee
liabilities” to Super Super Senior Creditors, the Super Senior Creditors, the Senior Secured Creditors, the
Future Senior Subordinated Creditors, the Intragroup Lenders and the Shareholder Creditors (together,
the “Primary Liabilities”) or “other liabilities” it may have to Shareholder Creditors, Intragroup Lenders
or Obligors (together, the “Other Liabilities”); (ii) any Transaction Security granted by that Obligor or
any subsidiary of that Obligor over any of its assets and any holding company of that Obligor over any

Creditor, Intragroup Lender, or another Obligor over that Obligor’s assets or over the assets of any
subsidiary of that Obligor;

release: (i) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or any part of its
Primary Liabilities and Other Liabilities; (ii) any Transaction Security granted by any subsidiary of that
holding company over any of its assets and any holding company of that holding company over shares,

the Security Agent (provided that it is acting in accordance with the Security Enforcement Principles) the
disposal, to third parties, of creditors’ claims against that Obligor or holding company (which may include
claims against the Issuer).

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected such that the claims of the holders of the Future Senior Subordinated
Debt Liabilities and Transaction Security over shares in (and any shareholder loans to) the Issuer or assets of a
guarantor of Future Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities or the Issuer is released, it will be a further condition
to the release that either:

(i) the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Representative has approved the release on the instructions of the
requisite Future Senior Subordinated Debt Creditors (as determined under the relevant Future Senior
Subordinated Debt Documents or, if not addressed thereunder, with the approval of at least a majority of
such Future Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities); or

(ii) each of the following conditions are satisfied:

(A) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash);

(B) all present and future obligations owed to the relevant secured parties under the Senior Debt
finance documents by a member of the Group, all of whose shares are pledged under the
Transaction Security are sold or disposed of pursuant to such Enforcement Action, are
unconditionally released and discharged or sold or disposed of concurrently with such sale (and
such obligations are not assumed by the purchaser or one of its affiliates), and all Transaction

249


-----

Security in respect of the assets that are sold or disposed of is simultaneously and unconditionally
released concurrently with such sale; and

(C) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made:

(II) where an internationally recognized investment bank or an internationally recognized firm
of accountants selected by the Security Agent has delivered an opinion in respect of such
sale or disposal that the amount received in connection therewith is fair from a financial
point of view taking into account all relevant circumstances including the method of
enforcement and the circumstances giving rise to such sale, provided that the liability of
such investment bank or internationally recognized firm of accountants in giving such
opinion may be limited to the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement.

The net proceeds of a Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities) shall be paid to the
Security Agent (as the case may be) for application in accordance with the provisions set forth under “—
_Application of Proceeds/Waterfall” above as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of the_
Transaction Security and, to the extent that any disposal of liabilities has occurred, as if the disposal of liabilities
had not occurred.

_refer to the Issuer and its subsidiaries and references to the “Issuer” refer to Assemblin Caverion Group AB_
_(publ) (formerly Assemblin Group AB (publ) and, before that, Apollo Swedish Bidco AB (publ))._

The Issuer will issue €     million aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2031
(the “Floating Rate Notes”) and €     million aggregate principal amount of      % Senior Secured Rate

indenture to be dated as of     , 2024 (the “Indenture”), between, inter alios, the Issuer, Deutsche Trustee
Company Limited, as trustee (the “Trustee”), and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as security agent (the
“Security Agent”) and as paying agent. The Indenture will not be qualified under, incorporate or include, by
reference or otherwise, or be subject to, any of the provisions of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

The proceeds of the offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date will be used as set forth in this Offering
Memorandum under the caption “Use of Proceeds.”

The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which €800 million aggregate principal amount
of Notes will be issued in this Offering. We may, subject to applicable law, issue an unlimited principal amount
of additional Notes having identical terms and conditions as the Notes (the “Additional Notes”); provided that,
if the Additional Notes are not fungible with the initial Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such
Additional Notes will be issued with a separate ISIN code or common code, as applicable, from the Notes.
Additional Notes may also be designated as “Additional Fixed Rate Notes” or “Additional Floating Rate
**Notes”. The initial Fixed Rate Notes and any Additional Fixed Rate Notes shall be deemed to form one series**
and references to the “Fixed Rate Notes” shall be deemed to include the Fixed Rate Notes initially issued on the
Issue Date as well as any Additional Fixed Rate Notes. The initial Floating Rate Notes and any Additional
Floating Rate Notes shall be deemed to form one series and references to the “Floating Rate Notes” shall be
deemed to include the Floating Rate Notes initially issued on the Issue Date as well as any Additional Floating
Rate Notes. However, in order for any Additional Notes to have the same ISIN, CUSIP or Common Code, as
applicable, as the Notes of the applicable series, such Additional Notes must be fungible with such series of the
Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We will only be permitted to issue Additional Notes in compliance
with the covenants contained in the Indenture, including the covenant restricting the Incurrence of Indebtedness
(as described below under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”). Except with respect to right of
payment and optional redemption, and as otherwise provided for in the Indenture, the Notes issued in this
Offering and, if issued, any Additional Notes will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture,
including, without limitation, with respect to waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Unless
the context otherwise requires, in this “Description of the Notes,” references to the “Notes” include the Notes
and any Additional Notes that are actually issued.

The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements (each as defined below). The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding
the terms and ranking of the Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” for a description of the material terms of the Intercreditor Agreement._

This “Description of the Notes” is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Notes, the
Indenture and the Security Documents, and it refers to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Since
this description of the terms of the Notes is only a summary, you should refer to the Notes, the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents for complete descriptions of the obligations of the Issuer
and your rights. Copies of the Indenture are available from us upon request.

The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered Holders will
have rights under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to enforcement and the pursuit of
other remedies. The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act and are subject to
certain transfer restrictions.

in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

###### Interest

_Interest on the Fixed Rate Notes_

Interest on the Fixed Rate Notes will accrue at the rate of      % per annum and will be payable, in cash, semiannually in arrears on April 5 and October 5 of each year, commencing on October 5, 2024 to Holders of record
on the immediately preceding Business Day, respectively. Interest on the Fixed Rate Notes will accrue from the
most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the date of the original
issuance. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360 day year comprised of twelve 30 day months. Each
interest period shall end on (but not include) the relevant interest payment date.

_Interest on the Floating Rate Notes_

Interest on the Floating Rate Notes will accrue at a rate per annum (the “Applicable Rate”), reset quarterly,
equal to the sum of (i) three-month EURIBOR (and if that rate is less than zero, EURIBOR shall be deemed to
be zero) plus (ii)      %, as determined by the calculation agent (the “Calculation Agent”), who shall initially
be Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch. Interest on the Floating Rate Notes will:

- accrue from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid;

- be payable quarterly in arrears on January 5, April 5, July 5 and October 5, commencing on October 5,
2024;

- be payable to the Holder of record of such Floating Rate Notes on the business day immediately preceding
the related interest payment date; and

- be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed.

Set forth below is a summary of certain of the provisions from the Indenture relating to the calculation of interest
on the Floating Rate Notes.

“Determination Date” means, with respect to an Interest Period, the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days
preceding the first day of such Interest Period.

“EURIBOR” means, with respect to an Interest Period, the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for
deposits in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the
Determination Date that appears on Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page or Bloomberg equivalent as of 11:00
a.m. London time, on the Determination Date. If Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page or its Bloomberg equivalent
does not include such a rate or is unavailable on a Determination Date, the Issuer will request the principal
London office of each of four major banks in the euro-zone inter-bank market, as selected by the Issuer, to provide
such bank’s offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London
time, on such Determination Date, to prime banks in the euro-zone inter-bank market for deposits in a
Representative Amount in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement
Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, the rate for the Interest
Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the
Issuer will request that each of three major banks in London, as selected by the Issuer, to provide such bank’s
rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Determination
Date, for loans in a Representative Amount in euro to leading European banks for a three-month period beginning
on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such rates are so

253


-----

provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than such rates are so
provided, then the rate for the Interest Period will be the rate in effect with respect to the immediately preceding
Interest Period.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if for any Interest Period the rate determined based on the procedure specified in
this paragraph is less than 0.0%, EURIBOR shall mean 0.0% for purposes of determining the Applicable Rate
for such Interest Period.

In the event that EURIBOR is no longer being calculated or administered or is otherwise no longer generally
accepted in the euro-zone for the purposes of determining floating rates of interest in respect of euro-denominated
securities, the alternative basis for determining the rate of interest on the Notes will be any successor rate
generally accepted in the euro-zone for the purposes of determining floating rates of interest in respect of eurodenominated securities, as identified by the Issuer in good faith; _provided that, in the event that there is no_
generally accepted successor rate to EURIBOR in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, the Issuer, in consultation
with the Rate Determination Agent, shall determine a reasonably appropriate alternative basis for determining
the rate of interest (and any applicable adjustment spread to reduce or eliminate, to the extent reasonably
practicable in the circumstances, any economic prejudice or benefit (as the case may be) to Holders of the Notes
as a result of the replacement of EURIBOR (the “Adjustment Spread”)) on the Notes; provided, further, that
any such alternative basis adopted pursuant to this paragraph shall in all cases never be less than 0.0%. Following
the adoption of an alternative basis pursuant to this paragraph, all references to “EURIBOR” in the Indenture
shall be deemed to refer to such alternative basis. The Issuer shall promptly thereafter notify the Holders of the
Notes and (by way of an Officer’s Certificate, delivered at least two Business Days prior to the relevant
Determination Date) the Calculation Agent of the new rate replacing EURIBOR, and the Calculation Agent shall
be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate (without further enquiry, investigation, verification or liability of
any kind whatsoever) as sufficient evidence thereof. Holders of the Notes shall be bound by any such alternative
basis (and the Adjustment Spread) without any further action or consent by the Holders of the Notes or the
Trustee; provided that if the Calculation Agent is unable (based on the information provided by the Issuer with
respect to such new rate or Adjustment Spread (if any)) to calculate, or calculate definitely, the interest rate
applicable to the Interest Period commencing immediately following notification thereof, then EURIBOR in
respect of such Interest Period will be the EURIBOR in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest
Period.

None of the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent shall be responsible or liable for any action or
inaction of the Issuer or its determination of such new rate. Nothing in the Indenture will require or oblige the
Trustee, Paying Agent or Calculation Agent to agree to any amendment or modification in connection with such
new rate which may, in its opinion, expose the Trustee, Paying Agent or Calculation Agent to any additional
liabilities or increase in its obligations or decrease in its rights or protections.

“euro-zone” means the region comprising of the member states of the European Union that adopt the euro.

“Interest Period” means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and ending on and
including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest payment date, with the exception that the
first Interest Period shall commence on and include the Issue Date and end on and include October 4, 2024.

“Representative Amount” means the greater of (i) €1,000,000 and (ii) an amount that is representative for a
single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time.

“Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page” means the display page so designated by Reuters (or such other page as
may replace that page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the information vendor).

The Calculation Agent shall, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (London time) on each Determination Date,
determine the Applicable Rate and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable in respect of the following
Interest Period (the “Interest Amount”). The Interest Amount shall be calculated by applying the Applicable

254


-----

Rate to the principal amount of each Floating Rate Note outstanding at the commencement of the Interest Period,
multiplying each such amount by the actual amounts of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 360. All
percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred
thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g.
4.876545% (or .04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or .0487655)). All euro amounts used in or resulting
from such calculations will be rounded to the nearest euro cent (with one half euro cent being rounded upwards).
The determination of the Applicable Rate and the Interest Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence
of willful default, fraud or manifest error, be final and binding on all parties. In no event will the rate of interest
on the Floating Rate Notes be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, provided, however,
that the Calculation Agent shall not be responsible for verifying that the rate of interest on the Floating Rate
Notes is permitted under any applicable law.

The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on such Notes are subject to applicable procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day at the
place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount
due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other
payment as a result of any such delay.

###### Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes

Principal, interest and premium, if any, on the Global Notes (as defined below) will be payable at the specified
office or agency of one or more Paying Agents; _provided_ that all such payments with respect to the Notes
represented by one or more Global Note registered in the name of or held by a nominee of a common depositary
for Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account specified by the Holder or Holders thereof.

Principal, interest, premium and Additional Amounts if any, on any certificated securities (“Definitive
**Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents maintained**
for such purposes. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be paid by wire transfer to the
person entitled thereto as shown on the register for the Definitive Registered Notes. See “—Paying Agent and
_Registrar for the Notes.”_

###### Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes

The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Notes. The Initial Paying Agent will be Deutsche
Bank AG, London Branch (the “Paying Agent”).

The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”) and a transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”). The
initial Registrar shall be Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. and the initial Transfer Agent shall be Deutsche Bank
AG, London Branch. The Registrar and Transfer Agent will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Notes
outstanding from time to time, if any, and will make payments on and facilitate transfers of the Notes on behalf
of the Issuer.

The Issuer may change any Paying Agents, Registrars or Transfer Agents for the Notes without prior notice to
the Holders of such Notes. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect
of the Notes.

###### Guarantees

By not later than the date falling 90 days following the Issue Date, the obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the
Notes, including any payment obligation resulting from a Change of Control, will (subject to any legal or
corporate benefit restrictions and the Agreed Security Principles) be guaranteed, jointly and severally on a senior
basis, by each Subsidiary of the Issuer that is a guarantor under the Pension Guarantee Facility, the Super Senior
Facilities and the Existing Notes, including Assemblin Financing AB (formerly Assemblin Group AB),
Assemblin Holding AB, Assemblin AB, Assemblin Sweden AB, Assemblin Norge AS, Fidelix Holding Oy,
Assemblin AS, Assemblin VS AB, Assemblin El AB, Assemblin Ventilation AB, Assemblin Oy, Fidelix Oy,
Crayfish BidCo Oy and Crayfish HoldCo Oy (the “Initial Assemblin Guarantors”). By the later of the date

255


-----

falling 90 days following the Issue Date and 30 days after Crayfish Bidco Oy obtaining title to all the issued and
outstanding shares in Caverion Corporation (“Caverion”)by posting security in the form required by Chapter
18, Section 6 of the Finnish Limited Liability Companies Act (the ”Finnish Companies Act”), the obligations
of the Issuer pursuant to the Notes, including any payment obligation resulting from a Change of Control, will
(subject to the Agreed Security Principles) also be guaranteed, jointly and severally on a senior basis, by the
following additional Subsidiaries of the Issuer, including Caverion Industria Oy, Caverion Suomi Oy, Caverion
Sverige AB, Caverion Norge AS and Caverion; (the “Initial Caverion Guarantors” and, together with the Initial
Assemblin Guarantors, the “Initial Guarantors”). As of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, the
Initial Guarantors represented 77.5 per cent. of our Combined Group EBITDA and over 100 per cent. of our
Combined Group assets (other than goodwill and shares in subsidiaries), in each case, calculated on a standalone basis without giving effect to intra-group eliminations (including intra-group receivables).

The obligations of the Guarantors will be contractually limited under the applicable Guarantees to reflect
limitations under applicable law with respect to maintenance of share capital, corporate benefit, fraudulent
conveyance and other legal restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and their respective shareholders, directors
and general partners. For a description of such legal and contractual limitations, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related
_to the Notes and the Collateral—The Notes Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to_
_certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may_
_limit their validity and enforceability,” and “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity_
_and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

A significant portion of the operations of the Issuer will be conducted through its Restricted Subsidiaries. Claims
of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors
holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority
stockholders (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and
earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including
Holders of the Notes. The Notes and each Guarantee therefore will be effectively subordinated to creditors
(including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of Restricted Subsidiaries of the
Issuer (other than the Guarantors). See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Collateral——The
_Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-Guarantor members of our Group.” Although the_
Indenture limits the incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted
Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture does not
impose any limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation
_on Indebtedness.”_

In addition, as described below under “—Certain Covenants—Future Guarantees” and subject to the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, each Restricted Subsidiary that guarantees the
Pension Guarantee Facility, the Super Senior Facilities, Public Debt or certain other indebtedness shall also enter
into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Notes.

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the
Pension Guarantee Facility, the Super Senior Facilities and the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include
restrictions on the granting of guarantees including where, among other things, such the relevant entity is not
incorporated other than in an agreed guarantee jurisdiction or is where such grant would be restricted by general
statutory or other contractual or legal limitations, restrictions or requirements, financial assistance, corporate
benefit, fraudulent preference, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and similar principles.

Each Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject
to avoidance or illegality under applicable financial assistance rules or fraudulent conveyance provisions of the
United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required
under the Agreed Security Principles to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By
virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts
payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. See

256

“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Collateral—The Notes Guarantees and the Collateral securing
_the Notes will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject_
_to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability,” and “Certain Insolvency Considerations and_
_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

The Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and release as described under “Certain Covenants—Release of the
_Guarantees.”_

###### Transfer and Exchange

The Notes will be issued in the form of several registered notes in global form without interest coupons, as
follows:

- Fixed Rate Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A
under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form
without interest coupons attached (the “144A Fixed Rate Global Notes”) and Floating Rate Notes sold
within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A will initially be
represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “144A
**Floating Rate Global Notes” and together with the 144A Fixed Rate Global Notes, the “144A Global**
**Notes”). The 144A Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of**
the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

- Fixed Rate Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will
initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached
(the “Regulation S Fixed Rate Global Notes”) and Floating Rate Notes sold to non-U.S. persons outside
the United States pursuant to Regulation S will initially be represented by one or more global notes in
registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Floating Rate Global Notes” and,
together with the Regulation S Fixed Rate Global Notes, the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together
with the 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Note will, on the Issue Date,
be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts
of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have
accounts with Euroclear and Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants.

Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on
transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under the section “Offering
_and Transfer Restrictions” in the Offering Memorandum. In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between_
participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant
to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or
Clearstream and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes of a series (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) may be transferred
to a person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes of such
series (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests”) denominated in the same currency only upon delivery by the
transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being
made in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Prior to 40 days after the Issue Date of the Notes, ownership of Regulation S Book-Entry Interests will be limited
to persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or persons who hold interests through Euroclear or
Clearstream, and any sale or transfer of such interest to US persons shall not be permitted during such period
unless such resale or transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Subject to the foregoing,
Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of 144A BookEntry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a
“qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of

257


-----

Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under the section “Offering and
_Transfer Restrictions” in the Offering Memorandum and in accordance with any applicable securities law of any_
other jurisdiction.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a
Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it
will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000
principal amount, and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions
relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected
that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from
the participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange
for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in
compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer
summarized below and described more fully under the section “Offering and Transfer Restrictions” in the
Offering Memorandum.

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be
transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 in principal amount and
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture
will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and
transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream,
where appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with such
transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any
Taxes payable in connection with such transfer. No 144A Fixed Rate Global Notes and/or Regulation S Fixed
Rate Global Notes may be transferred for any 144A Floating Rate Global Notes and/or Regulation S Floating
Rate Global Notes, and no 144A Floating Rate Global Notes and/or Regulation S Floating Rate Global Notes
may be transferred for 144A Fixed Rate Global Notes and/or Regulation S Fixed Rate Global Notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Definitive
Registered Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control
Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will be entitled to treat the Holder
of a Note as the owner of it for all purposes.

###### Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries

As of the Issue Date, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for purposes of the
Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under “—Certain Definitions—Unrestricted
_Subsidiary,” the Issuer will be permitted to designate certain of its Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries”._
Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture.

258

###### Security

 General

On the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, certain perfection
requirements and any Permitted Collateral Liens, by the Collateral securing the Existing Notes, including security
interests over:

- the issued Capital Stock of the Issuer (the “Issuer Share Pledge”);

- certain long-term material intra-Group loans (in respect of which the Issuer is a creditor), with a final
maturity date or intended tenor in excess of 12 months and with a principal amount in excess of €20
million (or its equivalent in other currencies) in aggregate to a Restricted Subsidiary as debtor (if any);

- existing and future shareholder loans owed by the Issuer to its immediate Parent (other than the
Shareholder Bridge Loan which will be partly repaid, with the remainder converted to equity in the Issuer
on the Issue Date); and

- the Issuer’s material operating bank accounts (but excluding any escrow, cash collateral, blocked and
pooling accounts, accounts connected with any Bank Products, accounts in connection with any
receivables financing (including discounting or factoring or similar), any guarantee or letter of credit
financing, or similar) (if any),

(together, the “Issue Date Collateral”).

By not later than the date falling 90 days following the Issue Date or, where relevant, the later of 90 days
following the Issue Date and 30 days after Crayfish Bidco Oy obtaining title to all the issued and outstanding
shares in Caverion by posting security in the form required by Chapter 18, Section 6 of the Finnish Companies
Act, the Notes will also be secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, certain perfection requirements
and any Permitted Collateral Liens, by Security Interests over:

- the issued Capital Stock of the Initial Guarantors;

- certain of the Initial Guarantors’ material operating bank accounts (but excluding any escrow, cash
collateral, blocked and pooling accounts, accounts connected with any Bank Products, accounts in
connection with any receivables financing (including discounting or factoring or similar), any guarantee
or letter of credit financing, or similar) (if any, and only to the extent that such bank accounts are required
to be secured under the Super Senior Facilities Agreements);

- certain long-term material intra-Group loans (in respect of which an Initial Guarantor is a creditor), with
a final maturity date in excess of 12 months and with a principal amount in excess of €20 million (or its
equivalent in other currencies) in aggregate to another Initial Guarantor as debtor (if any); and

- certain of the Initial Guarantors’ business mortgages (but only to the extent in existence prior to the date
of the super senior revolving credit and guarantee facilities agreement and pension guarantee agreement
and agreed between the Issuer and the mandated lead arrangers prior to the date of such agreements),

(together with the Issue Date Collateral, the “Collateral”).

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the Issuer and its Restricted_
Subsidiaries are permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with future issuances of
Indebtedness or Indebtedness of the Restricted Subsidiaries, including any Additional Notes issued by the Issuer
as permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes
_and the Collateral.”_

All Collateral shall be subject to the operation of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Agreed Security Principles and
any Permitted Collateral Liens. In addition, certain assets, including security forming part of the Collateral, have
or will be pledged to secure certain obligations under the Super Senior Facilities and/or the Existing Notes.

259


-----

However, Holders of the Notes are benefiting, or will benefit, indirectly from such security through the operation
of the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Other Indebtedness – The Intercreditor Agreement.”

Any other security interests that may in the future be granted to secure obligations under the Notes, any Guarantee
and the Indenture would also constitute “Collateral.” All Collateral will be subject to the operation of the Agreed
Security Principles and any Permitted Collateral Liens.

Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of the covenant described below under “—Certain
_Covenants—Future Guarantees,” certain property, rights and assets may not be pledged, and any pledge over_
property, rights and assets may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed Security
Principles. Pursuant to the Agreed Security Principles, a guarantee or security may not be given, or may be
limited. The following is a non-exhaustive summary of certain terms of the Agreed Security Principles which
include, among others:

- general legal and statutory limitations, financial assistance, capital maintenance, corporate benefit,
fraudulent preference, “interest stripping,” “controlled foreign corporation,” thin capitalization rules,
retention of title claims, employee consultation or approval requirements and similar principles may limit
the ability of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”) to provide a Guarantee
or security or may require that the Guarantee or security be limited by an amount or otherwise. If any
such limit applies, the Guarantees and security provided will be limited to the maximum amount which
the relevant member of the Group may provide having regard to applicable law (including any
jurisprudence) and subject to fiduciary duties of management;

- the giving of a Guarantee, the granting and the terms of security, the registration and/or the perfection of
the security granted or the becoming of a Guarantor will not be required;

- to the extent that the Group would incur any legal fees, registration fees, notary fees, stamp duty, taxes
and any other fees or costs directly associated with such security or Guarantee which are disproportionate
to the benefit obtained by the secured parties or having regard to the extent of the obligations which can
be guaranteed or secured by that security and the priority that will be offered by taking or perfecting the
security and, in any case, the security and the extent of its perfection will be agreed on the basis that the
cost to the Group of providing security shall be proportionate to the benefit accruing to the secured parties;

- where there is material incremental cost involved in creating security over all assets owned by the Issuer
or any Guarantor in a particular category the principle stated in the previous bullet above shall apply and,
subject to the Agreed Security Principles, only the material assets in that category shall be subject to
security;

- in certain jurisdictions, it may be either impossible, impractical or disproportionately costly to grant
Guarantees or create security over certain categories of assets in which event such Guarantees will not be
granted and security will not be taken over such assets;

- certain supervisory board, works council, regulator or regulatory board (or equivalent), or another external
body’s or person’s consent may be required to enable a member of the Group to provide a guarantee or
security. Such guarantee and/or security shall not be required unless such consent has been received
provided that reasonable endeavors have been used by the relevant member of the Group to obtain the
relevant consent (in each case if the security agent, taking into account the Issuer’s view on any potential
impact on relationships with third parties, reasonably requests the Issuer to do so);

- in connection with an acquisition or in respect of any acquired person or entity, any deadline and/or timing
requirement in connection with the giving of a guarantee, the granting of security, the registration and/or
the perfection of security, or the becoming of an Issuer, Guarantor or any other party may be amended,
varied, delayed and/or postponed by the Issuer (acting reasonably) in order to carry out or facilitate any
de-listing, public offers, squeeze-outs, compulsory redemption proceedings, irrevocables, private or open
market purchases, merger transactions and/or any other public or private sale, contribution, right of
transfer, or other similar transactions or arrangements (or any combination thereof);

260


-----

- any person or assets subject to legal requirements, leases, licenses or any other third-party arrangements
(including, without limitation, any trade receivables and any commercial contract agreement) which may
prevent a guarantee being granted or those assets from being charged (or guarantee which, if granted, or
assets which, if charged, would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights,
benefits and/or obligations of the Group in respect of those assets or require any member of the Group to
take any action materially adverse to the interests of the Group or any member thereof) will be excluded
from any requirement to provide guarantees and security and from any relevant Security Document
provided that, if the relevant asset is material and the Issuer determines (acting in good faith) that such
endeavors will not jeopardize commercial relationships with third parties, the relevant member of the
Group will use commercially reasonable endeavors to obtain any necessary consent or waiver;

- notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision to the contrary, no guarantees or security shall be
required from or over (and no consent or waiver request submitted with respect to) any person or assets
which are required to support letter of credit/bank guarantee arrangements (or similar), leasing
arrangements of indebtedness assumed or incurred in connection with an acquisition to the extent
permitted by the terms of the Notes Documents to remain outstanding following an acquisition
(“Assumed Acquisition Indebtedness”) and no member of the target group or other person or entity
acquired pursuant to an acquisition where Assumed Acquisition Indebtedness remains outstanding
following completion of such permitted acquisition shall be required to become a Guarantor or grant
security with respect to the Notes Documents if prevented or restricted by the terms of Assumed
Acquisition Indebtedness (or the documentation governing Assumed Acquisition Indebtedness) (or any
permitted refinancing or replacement of such Assumed Acquisition Indebtedness) or if becoming a
Guarantor or the granting of any security would give rise to a material obligation (including any material
expense or payment obligation) under or in relation thereto, and no security will be required to be granted
over any asset to the extent constituting a Permitted Lien (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, under
paragraph (28) of that definition);

- members of the Group will not be required to give Guarantees or enter into Security Documents if it is
not within the legal capacity of the relevant members of the Group or if the same would conflict with the
fiduciary duties of those directors or contravene any legal prohibition, bona fide contractual restriction or
regulatory condition or result in (or in a material risk of) personal or criminal liability on the part of any
Officer or result in any significant risk of legal liability for the directors of any Group company, provided
that the relevant member of the Group shall use reasonable endeavors to overcome such obstacle;

- additional guarantee limitation provisions may be included in any supplemental indenture if required by
any Officer of any member of the Group in connection with the granting of a Guarantee in order to protect
that Officer from potential liability or other legal risk;

- the terms of the security should not be such that they materially restrict the running of the business of or
materially adversely affect the tax arrangements of the relevant member of the Group in the ordinary
course as otherwise permitted by the Notes Documents;

- perfection of security, when required, and other legal formalities will be completed as soon as practicable
and, in any event, within the time periods specified in the Notes Documents therefor or (if earlier or to
the extent no such time periods are specified in the Notes Documents) within the time periods specified
by applicable law in order to ensure due perfection. The giving of a guarantee, the granting of security or
the perfection of security interests granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse effect
on the ability of the relevant Guarantor to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course as
otherwise permitted by the Notes Documents (and any requirement under the Agreed Security Principles
to seek consent of any person or take or not take any other action shall be subject to this paragraph);

- access to the assets of a Guarantor and the maximum guaranteed or secured amount may be restricted or
limited to minimize stamp duty, notarization, registration or other applicable fees, taxes and duties where
the benefit of increasing the guaranteed or secured amount is disproportionate to the level of such fees,

261


-----

taxes and duties (and in any event the maximum aggregate amount payable by the Group in respect of
fees, costs, expenses, disbursements and VAT relating to the provision of guarantees and security shall be
limited to an amount to be agreed between the security agent and the Issuer);

- no perfection action will be required in jurisdictions where the Issuer or a Guarantor is not located;
provided, however, that perfection actions may be required in the jurisdiction of one Guarantor in relation
to security granted by another Guarantor in a different jurisdiction; provided further than no perfection
action shall be required in relation to any security other than security granted over (i) the Capital Stock in
an Issuer or Guarantor incorporated in an agreed security jurisdiction (being, as at the Issue Date, Sweden,
Finland, Denmark and Norway); (ii) Subordinated Shareholder Funding provided to the Issuer pursuant
to a Security Document governed by Swedish law; (iii) business mortgages by certain Initial Guarantors
pursuant to a Security Document governed by Swedish law; and (iv) (solely upon the occurrence of an
enforcement event) (x) certain structural intercompany loans by an Issuer or Guarantor; or (y) material
operating bank accounts;

- guarantees and security will not be required from or over, or over the assets of, any joint venture or similar
arrangement or any minority interest;

- where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of granting
security over the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such security, security will be
granted over the material assets only;

- any member of the Group which is not incorporated in an agreed security jurisdiction (being, as at the
Issue Date, Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Norway) shall not be required to become a Guarantor or
provide security, and no guarantees or security shall be required in respect of assets located outside of the
agreed security jurisdictions;

- any member of the Group which is not (directly or indirectly) a wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Issuer (a
“Non Wholly-Owned Subsidiary”) shall not be required to become a Guarantor or provide any security,
if the Issuer is unable (after using its commercially reasonable endeavors, and provided that doing so does
not give rise to additional material obligations (including any expense or payment obligation) under or in
relation thereto) to procure consent from the minority shareholders to such member of the Group
becoming a Guarantor (including (without limitation) due to, for example, the opposition of the minority
shareholders, material payment obligations, legal or regulatory constraints or financial assistance
restrictions) and provided that this paragraph shall not apply to any Non Wholly-Owned Subsidiary which
is an Issuer;

- no security (other than floating security) will be required to be taken over fixed assets, parts, stock,
moveable plant or equipment, trade receivables, intellectual property rights or real estate (other than where
such security may be granted under local law pursuant to a “floating charge” or all assets Security
Document without material cost to the relevant Guarantor), and no security will be required over hedging
agreements;

- no security shall be required to be given over any escrow, cash collateral, blocked and pooling accounts,
accounts connected with any Bank Products, any receivables financing (including Qualified Receivables
Financing, discounting or factoring or similar), any guarantee or letter of credit financing, or similar), or
any accounts which are not material operating bank accounts;

- no Guarantee or security shall Guarantee or secure any “Excluded Swap Obligations” defined in
accordance with the LSTA Market Advisory Update dated February 15, 2013 entitled “Swap Regulations’
Implications for Loan Documentation,” and any update thereto by the LSTA;

- no member of the Group will be required to create security over or otherwise encumber any Restricted
Asset (as defined below) (including, without limitation, any bank accounts which contain or are
reasonably likely to contain any Restricted Assets); and

262


-----

- no guarantees or security shall be required to be provided where to do so would be contrary to applicable
law or the provisions of the Agreed Security Principles. By virtue of the operation of the Agreed Security
Principles, guarantees and security may be given to, for the benefit of, or in respect of, certain secured
parties and certain liabilities which may not be given to, for the benefit of, or in respect of, other secured
parties and other liabilities (which may include the Notes).

For the purposes of the foregoing paragraph, “Restricted Asset” means:

- the regulatory capital that a regulated entity is required to maintain pursuant to any applicable law or
regulation or the views, guidance or interpretation of any relevant regulator;

- the settlement cash balances of that regulated entity and any other cash held by or on behalf of that
regulated entity for merchants, card schemes, cardholders of any card scheme, banks, financial institutions
or other similar entity or person;

- any amounts held by or on behalf of that regulated entity in segregated funds under the Payment Services
Directive (PSD, 2007/64/EC) (or any relevant local implementing regulation or legislation) for merchants
or other payment service users or payment service providers or card schemes, cardholders of any card
scheme, banks, financial institutions or other similar entity or person;

- any sums receivable by or on behalf of that regulated entity from or under any card scheme, bank, financial
institution or other similar entity or person for onward transmission or remittance to a merchant;

- any sums receivable by or on behalf of that regulated entity from a merchant for onward transmission or
remittance to a card scheme bank, financial institution or other similar entity or person; and

- any right, title or interest of that regulated entity in or under any letter of credit, guarantee, cash collateral
or other financial support or security provided by a bank, financial institution or other similar entity (or
an affiliate thereof) for its account to any card scheme counterparty.

As described above, all of the Collateral will also secure the liabilities under the Existing Notes, the Super Senior
Facilities, as well as certain future Hedging Obligations and any Additional Notes and may also secure certain
future indebtedness; provided, however, that the lenders under the Super Senior Facilities and counterparties to
certain future Hedging Obligations, will receive the proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in priority
to the Holders of the Notes and any Additional Notes. See “—Priority.” See also, “Risk Factors—Risks Related
_to the Notes and the Collateral—Creditors under the Super Senior Facilities, any credit facility that refinances_
_or replaces the Super Senior Facilities, certain hedging obligations and certain other indebtedness and_
_obligations (including any future guarantee facilities) permitted to be incurred on a priority basis under the_
_Indenture are entitled to be repaid in priority to the Notes.”_

The lenders under the Super Senior Facilities and/or counterparties to certain future Hedging Obligations and
any Additional Notes may also benefit from security which does not secure the Notes offered hereby.

No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with this Offering of the Notes. By its nature, some
or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the
Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
_Notes and the Collateral—It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes.”_

###### Priority

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the Security
Documents (the “Security Interests” and each a “Security Interest”) is established by the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture, the Existing Notes Indenture, the Security Documents and the security
documents relating to the Pension Guarantee Facility, the other Super Senior Facilities and such Hedging
Obligations (if any) which provide, among other things, that the obligations under the Notes will receive proceeds
on enforcement of security over the Collateral only after the claims of the Pension Guarantee Facility, followed
by the claims of the other Super Senior Facilities and such future Hedging Obligations and any future

263


-----

Indebtedness permitted to be secured on a super-priority basis in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and
the Intercreditor Agreement, are satisfied.

See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”. In addition, pursuant to the
Intercreditor Agreements or Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Issue Date, the Collateral
may be pledged or assigned to secure other Indebtedness. See “—Release of Liens,” “—Certain Covenants—
_Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens.”_

###### Security Documents

Under the Security Documents, security will be granted over the Collateral to secure, inter alia, the payment
when due of the Issuer’s payment obligations under the Notes and the Indenture. The Security Documents will
be entered into among, inter alios, the relevant security provider and the Security Agent as agent for the secured
parties. When entering into the Security Documents, the Security Agent will act in its own name, but for the
benefit of the secured parties (including itself, the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes from time to time). Under
the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will also act as an agent of the Trustee and holders under the
Existing Notes Indenture, the lenders under the Super Senior Facilities and the counterparties under certain
Hedging Obligations in relation to the Security Interests created in favor of such parties.

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by the applicable laws,
only the Security Agent will have the right to enforce the Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee and the
Holders of the Notes. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, Holders of the Notes will not be entitled
to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Security Agent
under the Indenture. To the extent permitted by the applicable laws and subject to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Indenture, Holders of the Notes will, in certain circumstances, be entitled to direct the Trustee
to provide instructions to the Security Agent for the enforcement of security over the Collateral. Under the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will also act on behalf of the Trustee and holders under the Existing
Notes Indenture, the lenders under the Super Senior Facilities and the counterparties under certain hedging
agreements in relation to the Security Interests in favor of such parties.

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes and
the Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by Security Interests in the Collateral until all obligations under the
Notes and the Indenture have been discharged. However, the Security Interests may be released under certain
circumstances as provided under “—Release of Liens” below. Please see the section of this Offering
Memorandum entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Collateral.” The validity and
enforceability of the Security Interests will be subject to, inter alia, the limitations described in “Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to the Notes and the Collateral” and “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the_
_Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

The Security Documents will provide that the rights under the Security Documents and the Indenture must be
exercised by the Security Agent. The Holders may only act through the Trustee, who will instruct the Security
Agent in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.

In the event that the Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the
Security Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in the
Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the Security
Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement was successful, the Holders may not be able to recover any
amounts under the Security Documents. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Collateral.”

###### Enforcement of Security Interest

The Security Documents will provide that the rights under the Security Documents must be exercised by the
Security Agent. Since the Holders are not a party to the Security Documents, Holders may not, individually or
collectively, take any direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Security Documents. The Holders
may only act through the Security Agent or the Trustee (as applicable).

264


-----

To the extent permitted by the applicable laws and subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the
Indenture, Holders of the Notes will, in certain circumstances, be entitled to direct the Trustee to provide
instructions to the Security Agent for the enforcement of security over the Collateral. The Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement will restrict the ability of the Holders or the Trustee to enforce the Security Interests and
provide for the release of the Security Interests created by the Security Documents in certain circumstances upon
enforcement by the lenders under the Super Senior Facilities. These limitations are described under “Description
_of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Certain Insolvency Considerations and_
_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests.” The ability to_
enforce may also be restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness that is secured on the
Collateral in compliance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Trustee and holders under the Existing Notes Indenture, creditors under the Super Senior Facilities, the
counterparties to certain Hedging Obligations (if any) secured by the Collateral and the Trustee have, and by
accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to have, appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent under the
Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents securing such Indebtedness, including the Security
Documents. The Trustee and holders under the Existing Notes Indenture, creditors under the Super Senior
Facilities, the counterparties to certain Hedging Obligations (if any) secured by the Collateral and the Trustee
have, and by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to have, authorized the Security Agent to: (i) perform
the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor
Agreement and the security documents securing such Indebtedness, including the Security Documents, together
with any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each Security Document, waiver,
modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Security Agent on its behalf.

###### Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer and the Trustee will be authorized (without any further consent of the
Holders of the Notes) to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement to give effect to the provisions described in the
section entitled “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder of the Notes, by accepting such Note, will be deemed to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements;

(2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents;

(3) agreed and acknowledged that the Security Agent will administer the Collateral in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture and the Security Documents; and

(4) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into and comply with
the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

Please see the sections entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Collateral—Holders of the
_Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral” and “Description of Certain Financing_
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as
defined below) entered into in compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional
_Intercreditor Agreements.”_

###### Release of Liens

The Issuer and its Subsidiaries and any provider of Collateral will be entitled to the release of the Security
Interests in respect of the Collateral under any one or more of the following circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral (other than the Issuer Share Pledge or, after
the Post-Closing Merger and to the extent it is a successor for the Issuer, the MergerCo Share Pledge (as
defined below)) to (a) any Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any

265

disposition does not violate the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of
_Assets and Subsidiary Stock” or is otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture or (b) any_
Restricted Subsidiary, provided that this clause (b) shall not be relied upon in the case of a transfer of
capital stock or of accounts receivable to a Restricted Subsidiary (except to a Receivables Subsidiary)
unless the relevant property and assets remain subject to, or otherwise become subject to a Lien in favor
of the Notes following such sale or disposal;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the
release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

(3) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(4) in connection with the Post-Closing Merger; provided that, to the extent permitted by law and subject to
the Agreed Security Principles, certain perfection requirements and any Permitted Collateral Liens, the
Notes will be secured by first-priority security interests over the issued Capital Stock of MergerCo (the
“MergerCo Share Pledge”);

(5) automatically without any action by the Trustee, if the Lien granted in favor of the Indebtedness that gave
rise to the obligation to grant the Lien over such Collateral is released and such Lien is not otherwise
required to be granted in favor of the Notes as provided under “— Certain Covenants—Limitations on
_Liens”;_

(6) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or defeasance or discharge
of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

Unrestricted Subsidiary;

case of a merger, consolidation or other transfer of assets in compliance with the covenant described
below under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”;

(10) with respect to the Securities Interests in respect of the Capital Stock of a Person or its Restricted
Subsidiary or Parent to be Offered, within a reasonable time to facilitate an Initial Public Offering in
which such Person or its Restricted Subsidiary or Parent is the IPO Entity (an “IPO Release”); provided
that (i) the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio is not, at such time, greater than 3.75 to 1.00 (calculated on
a pro forma basis after giving effect to such Initial Public Offering and the receipt and use of proceeds
therefrom) and (ii) such security interests so released shall be promptly granted or re-granted, as
applicable, in favor of the Notes in the event that such Capital Stock is not sold or the Initial Public
Offering does not complete for any reason; or

(11) in the case of any security interests over intra-group receivables (if any), upon partial repayment or
discharge thereof, the security interests created over such receivables will be automatically reduced in
proportion to such partial repayment or discharge and, upon full repayment or discharge thereof, the
security interests shall be automatically and fully released and of no further effect; or

(12) as may be permitted by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security
_Interest” or as otherwise provided in the Indenture._

At the request of the Issuer, the Security Agent and the Trustee (if required) will take all necessary action required
to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions
of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security

266


-----

Document. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the
Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee (unless action is required by it to effect such release).

In connection with the Transactions, the Security Agent shall enter into such documentation as may be requested
by the Issuer and take all necessary action required to consent to, permit and provide for the payments to be made
as more fully described under “–Use of Proceeds” and any related consent or release required in connection
therewith.

Notwithstanding any other provisions, the release of any perfected Liens over any assets created by the Parent,
the Issuer or any Guarantor pursuant to a security document governed by Swedish law or Finnish law which is
“Perfected Security” (being security over (i) the Capital Stock in an Issuer or Guarantor that is incorporated in
Sweden or Finland; (ii) Subordinated Shareholder Funding; (iii) business mortgages granted by certain Initial
Guarantors) or disposal of (including by way of merger of shares or assets which are subject to such Liens) or
transfer of any assets, property and/or interests which are the subject of such Liens shall be subject to the prior
written consent of the Security Agent, except in the case of any Post-Closing Merger (completed on or prior to
the date falling 12 months after the Issue Date and provided that, to the extent involving the Issuer, the Issuer is
the surviving entity) or where the assets to be released are disposed of for market value and the proceeds are
directly paid to the Security Agent and applied towards repayment and/or prepayment of any debt secured by the
relevant Liens (or are paid into a blocked account which is subject to perfected Liens and held with the Security
Agent). The Security Agent’s consent shall be given in its sole discretion.

Each Holder of the Notes irrevocably authorises and instructs the Security Agent to consent to any such release
and to release such Liens in relation to any transaction or arrangement which is permitted by the Indenture,
without notification, consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from or reference to the Holders. The
Security Agent shall not unreasonably delay the giving of such consent and release.

purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party
will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 10 days
following such tender offer expiration date, to redeem the series of Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but
not in part, following such purchase, at a price equal to the price (excluding any early tender premium or similar

Notes for redemption in compliance with the requirements of the principal securities exchange, if any, on which
the Notes are listed, and in compliance with the requirements of Euroclear or Clearstream, or if the Notes are not
so listed or such exchange prescribes no method of selection and the Notes are not held through Euroclear or
Clearstream, or Euroclear or Clearstream prescribes no method of selection, on a pro rata basis by use of a pool
factor; provided, however, that no Note of €100,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in
part and only Notes in integral multiples of €1,000 will be redeemed. Neither the Trustee, the Paying Agent nor
the Registrar will be liable for any selections made in accordance with this paragraph.

269


-----

If and so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited
and to the extent that the rules and regulations of The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the
“Authority”) so require, the Issuer shall notify the Authority of such redemption and, in addition to such
publication, not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption, the Issuer will mail, or at the
expense of the Issuer, cause to be mailed, such notice to Holders. All notices to Holders will be validly given if
mailed to them at their respective addresses in the register of Holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar. For
Notes which are represented by global certificates held on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, notices may be
given by delivery of the relevant notices to Euroclear or Clearstream in substitution for the aforesaid mailing to
Holders.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the portion
of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive
Registered Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of any Definitive Registered Note
redeemed in part will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Definitive
Registered Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Note to decrease the
principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the
applicable redemption notice, Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and
after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of Notes called for redemption.

###### Redemption for Taxation Reasons

The Issuer may redeem the Notes of a series in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 10
nor more than 60 days’ prior notice to the Holders of the Notes of such series (which notice will be irrevocable)
at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest,
if any, to the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on
the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts
(as defined below under “—Withholding Taxes”), if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax
Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if any, if the Issuer determines in good faith that, as
a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder)
of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any amendment to, or change in an official written position regarding the application, administration or
interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a
court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) (each of the foregoing
in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Notes would be, required to
pay Additional Amounts with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the
payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or another Guarantor who can make such
payment without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts) and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking
reasonable measures available to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new
Paying Agent where this would be reasonable). Such Change in Tax Law must be announced and become
effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Tax Jurisdiction became a Relevant Tax
Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date). The foregoing provisions shall apply mutatis mutandis
to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture, with respect to a change
or amendments occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under
“—Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given: (a) earlier
than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of Additional
Amounts; and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains
in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of any such series of Notes pursuant to
the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee: (i) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect

270


-----

such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to
redeem have been satisfied; and (ii) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing and
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) to the effect that the
relevant Payor has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law.
The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion of tax counsel as
sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in
which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

###### Withholding Taxes

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (each, a “Payor”) in respect of the Notes or
with respect to any Guarantee, as applicable, will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction
for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any
deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) Sweden or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or therein having power to tax;

(2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or any Guarantee is made by or on
behalf of the Payor, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the
power to tax; or

(3) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated, organized, engaged in business for tax purposes,
or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental
authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1), (2) and (3) a “Relevant Taxing
**Jurisdiction”),**

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor or the
Paying Agent under or with respect to any Note or any Guarantee, including, without limitation, payments of
principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such
additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in
respect of such payments, after such withholding or deduction (including any such deduction or withholding
from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been received in respect of
such payments on any such Note or Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction; _provided,_
_however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:_

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection
between the relevant Holder or the beneficial owner of a Note (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary,
partner, member or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder or beneficial owner, if
the relevant Holder or beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company
or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being resident for tax
purposes, or being a citizen or resident, national or domiciliary of, or carrying on a business for tax
purposes, or maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership,
holding or sale of such Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under
such Note, the Indenture or a Guarantee;

(2) any Tax that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner of the
Note to comply with a written request of the Payor or any other person through whom payment can be
made addressed to the Holder, after reasonable notice by the Payor (at least 60 days before any such
withholding or deduction would be payable), to provide certification, information, documents or other
evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity or connection with the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction
of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other
reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or
administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part
of such Tax but, only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such
certification or documentation;

271


-----

(3) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of the Note for
payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made
available for payment to the Holder;

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment of the principal
of, premium, if any, or interest, if any, on the Notes or with respect to any Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other
governmental charge;

(6) any Taxes imposed in connection with a Note presented for payment by or on behalf of a Holder or
beneficial owner who would have been able to avoid such Tax by presenting the relevant Note to, or
otherwise accepting payment from, another Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union; or

(7) any combination of the items (1) through (6) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or
any person other than the beneficial owner of the Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settler with respect
to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to
Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner held such Notes directly.

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture, any amounts to be paid on the Notes by or on behalf of
the Issuer will be paid net of any deduction or withholding imposed or required pursuant to an agreement
described in Section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or otherwise
imposed pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (or any regulations thereunder or official
interpretations thereof) or an intergovernmental agreement between the United States and another jurisdiction
facilitating the implementation thereof (or any fiscal or regulatory legislation, rules or practices implementing
such an intergovernmental agreement) (any such withholding or deduction, a “FATCA Withholding”). Neither
the Issuer nor any other person will be required to pay any additional amounts in respect of FATCA Withholding.

The Payor will (i) make or cause to be made any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount
deducted or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use
all reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted
or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes or, if such tax receipts are not
reasonably available, other reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee
and copied to the Paying Agent. Such copies or other evidence shall be made available to the Holders upon
request and will be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any Note or
any Guarantee, at least 45 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the
Paying Agent, an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount
estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional
Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less
than 30 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate
as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are
necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a redemption of Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Guarantee,

272


-----

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context,
Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay and indemnify the Holder or beneficial owner for any present or future stamp, issue,
registration, transfer, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest,
penalties or additions to tax) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including
any related interest, penalties or additions to tax) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution,
delivery, or registration of any Notes, any Guarantee, the Indenture, or any other document or instrument in
relation thereto (other than in each case, in connection with a transfer of the Notes after this Offering) or the
receipt of any payments with respect thereto or any such taxes or charges or levies (including any related interest,
penalties, or additions to tax) imposed by any jurisdiction as a result of, or in connection with, the enforcement
of the Notes or any Guarantee (limited, solely in the case of the receipt of any payments with respect thereto, to
taxes or similar charges or levies imposed in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction that are not excluded under clauses
(1) through (3) above or clauses (5) through (7) above or any combination thereof).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and any transfer
by a Holder or beneficial owner of its Notes, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any
successor to a Payor is incorporated, organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for
tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to the Notes is made
by or on behalf of such Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**IPO Pushdown**

(1) On, in contemplation of, or following an Initial Public Offering (an “IPO Event”), the Issuer shall be
entitled to require (by written notice to the Trustee and the Security Agent (a “Pushdown Notice”)) that
the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement)
shall automatically operate (with effect from the date specified in the relevant Pushdown Notice) on the
basis that: (i) references to the “Group” and to the Issuer and Restricted Subsidiaries (and all related
provisions) shall apply only to the IPO Pushdown Entity and its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time;
(ii) all financial ratio calculations, basket calculations and financial definitions shall exclude any Parent
of the IPO Pushdown Entity and all reporting obligations shall be assumed at the level of the IPO
Pushdown Entity; (iii) each reference in the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) to the “Issuer” shall be deemed to be a reference to the IPO Pushdown Entity
(to the extent applicable and unless the context requires otherwise); and provided, further, that nothing in
this paragraph, including the deeming construct contemplated by this sub-paragraph (iii) and any action
related thereto taken by the IPO Pushdown Entity prior to but in connection with it being deemed to be
the Issuer, shall, or shall be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any
representation, warranty, undertaking, covenant or other term in the Indenture or a Default or an Event of
Default; (iv) none of the representations, warranties, undertakings, covenants or Events of Default, as
applicable, in the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the
Security Documents shall apply to any Parent of the IPO Pushdown Entity (whether in its capacity as a
Guarantor in respect of the Notes or otherwise); (v) no event, matter or circumstance relating to any Parent
of the IPO Pushdown Entity (whether in its capacity as a Guarantor or otherwise) shall, or shall be deemed
to, directly or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking,
covenant or other term in the Indenture or a Default or an Event of Default; (vi) each Holding Company
and Parent of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released from all
obligations under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement)
and any security granted by any such Holding Company or Parent provided that any release of Liens over
the Capital Stock of the IPO Entity, any Holding Company or any Parent of the IPO Entity (as applicable)
or over Subordinated Shareholder Funding provided to such entity (as applicable) pursuant to this section
“IPO Pushdown” constitutes an IPO Release as described under paragraph (9) under “—Security—
_Release of Liens” and is subject to the further conditions described therein and to the conditions described_
in the last paragraph under “—Security—Release of Liens” unless following such release, Security
Interests under Security Documents exist or will, promptly following such Initial Public Offering, exist

273


-----

over the Capital Stock in a member of the Group as selected by the Issuer that holds (directly or indirectly)
all or substantially all of the assets of the Group and any Subordinated Shareholder Funding provided by
a direct or indirect shareholder to such entity, such that a single point of enforcement in respect of the
Group will be maintained after the Initial Public Offering of the IPO Entity; (vii) unless otherwise notified
by the Issuer: (A) each Person which is party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) as a “Shareholder Creditor” (as such term is defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement) shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released from the Intercreditor Agreement (or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and all obligations and restrictions under the Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (and from the date specified by the Issuer, that Person shall
cease to be party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as a
“Shareholder Creditor” (as such term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) and shall have no further
rights or obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an
Investor); and (B) there shall be no obligation or requirement for any Person to become party to the
Intercreditor Agreement as a “Shareholder Creditor” (as such term is defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement); and (viii) in the event that any Person is released from or does not become party to the
Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as a “Shareholder Creditor” (as such
term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) as a consequence of this paragraph (1), any term of the
Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) which requires
or assumes that any Person be a “Shareholder Creditor” (as such term is defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement) or that any liabilities or obligations to such Person be subject to the Intercreditor Agreement
(or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or otherwise subordinated shall cease to apply.

(2) The Trustee, the Security Agent and any other agents party thereto shall be required to enter into any
amendment to the Indenture or amendment to or replacement of the Intercreditor Agreement or the other
collateral documents required by the Issuer in writing and/or take such other action as is required by the
Issuer in order to facilitate or reflect any of the matters contemplated by paragraph (1) of this covenant
(collectively, an “IPO Pushdown”). The Trustee, the Security Agent and any other agents party thereto
are each irrevocably authorized and instructed by the Holders of the Notes (without any requirement to
obtain consent by the Holders of the Notes) to execute any such amended or replacement documents
and/or take other such action on behalf of the Holders (and shall do so on the reasonable request of and
at the cost of the Issuer).

(3) For the purpose of this covenant, the “IPO Pushdown Entity” shall be the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer notified to the Trustee and the Security Agent by the Issuer in writing as the
Person to be treated as the IPO Pushdown Entity in relation to the relevant IPO Event; provided, that the
IPO Pushdown Entity shall be the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer that will issue shares, or
whose shares are to be sold, pursuant to that IPO Event (or a Parent of the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary).

(4) If the Issuer delivers a Pushdown Notice to the Trustee and the Security Agent pursuant to paragraph (1)
of this covenant in relation to a contemplated IPO Event, it shall be entitled to revoke that Pushdown
Notice at any time prior to the occurrence of the relevant IPO Event by written notice to the Trustee and
the Security Agent. In the event that any Pushdown Notice is revoked in accordance with this paragraph
(4): (i) the provisions of clauses (i) to (viii) of the first paragraph of this covenant shall cease to apply in
relation to that Pushdown Notice; (ii) if any security has been released pursuant to paragraph (1) above in
reliance on that Pushdown Notice, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Issuer or the relevant
Restricted Subsidiary shall as soon as reasonably practicable execute a replacement Security Document
in respect of that security; and (iii) if any “Shareholder Creditor” (as such term is defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement) has been released from the Intercreditor Agreement pursuant to sub-paragraph
(a)(vii) above in reliance on that Pushdown Notice, that Person shall as soon as reasonably practicable
accede to the Intercreditor Agreement as a “Shareholder Creditor” (as such term is defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement).

274


-----

For the avoidance of doubt: (A) nothing in paragraph (4) above shall prohibit or otherwise restrict the Issuer from
delivering a further Pushdown Notice in relation to any actual or contemplated IPO Event; and (B) revocation of
a Pushdown Notice shall not, and shall not be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of
any representation, warranty, undertaking or other term in the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or a
Default or an Event of Default (whether by reason of any action or step taken by any Person, or any matter or
circumstance arising or committed, while that Pushdown Notice was effective or otherwise).

###### Change of Control

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms of the covenant described under this heading “—Change of
_Control,” each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part of such Holder’s Notes_
at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes repurchased, plus accrued and
unpaid interest to (but not including) the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however, that the Issuer shall
not be obligated to repurchase the Notes as described under this heading, “—Change of Control,” in the event
and to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of the Notes of such series as
described under “—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived.

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes as described under “— Optional
_Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60_
days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will deliver a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each
Holder of Notes, with a copy to the Trustee:

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require
the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of
the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of
purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant
interest payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”);

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date
such notice is delivered) and the record date (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) stating that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue
interest on the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Payment is not paid, and
that any Notes or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest;

(4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute
the Change of Control;

(5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must
follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and

(6) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of
Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the
extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes
so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal
amount of Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer;

(4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent the Global Notes in
order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and
purchased by the Issuer; and

275


-----

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Registrar for
cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer.

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly deliver to each Holder of
Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee (or an
authenticating agent) will, at the cost of the Issuer, promptly authenticate and deliver (or cause to be transferred
by book-entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal
amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any, provided that each such new Note will be in
a principal amount that is at least €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

If and so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited
and to the extent that the rules and regulations of The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited so require,
the Issuer will notify the Authority of any Change of Control Offer.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that
permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover,
recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase such
Holder’s Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the
Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party
makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements
set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes
validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control,
conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place providing
for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. The closing date of any such Change
of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control may be changed to conform to the actual closing date
of the Change of Control, provided that such closing date is not earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from
the date the Change of Control Offer notice is mailed as described in the second paragraph of this section.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and
any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To
the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the
Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached
its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of the conflict.

If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not
withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third-party making a Change of Control
Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by
such Holders, the Issuer or such third-party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’
prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer
described above, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to
101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but
excluding the date of redemption.

The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a
number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control may require a
mandatory prepayment of certain Indebtedness. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control
under certain Indebtedness and may require a mandatory prepayment of such Indebtedness may not constitute a
Change of Control under the Indenture. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain
prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be
repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer
to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the
Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s

276


-----

ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial
resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required
repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Collateral—We may not be able to obtain
_the funds required to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control and the occurrence of certain important_
_corporate events will not constitute a Change of Control.”_

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets
of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a
limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of
the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree
of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of
the property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred
and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a
result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in
outstanding principal amount of the Notes.

###### Certain Covenants

 Limitation on Indebtedness

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness (including
Acquired Indebtedness); _provided, however, that the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary may Incur_
Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) if on the date of such Incurrence and after giving pro forma
effect thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof):

(1) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Relevant Period ending on the Applicable Reporting Date for
the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been at least 2.00 to 1.00; and

(2) to the extent that the Indebtedness is Senior Secured Indebtedness, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net
Leverage Ratio for the Relevant Period ending on the Applicable Reporting Date would have been no
greater than 4.50 to 1.00.

Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not Guarantors may only incur Indebtedness pursuant to this
first paragraph if the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Indebtedness incurred by Restricted
Subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not Guarantors pursuant to this first paragraph (calculated at the time
of such incurrence and after giving effect to the incurrence of such Indebtedness and the application of
proceeds thereof, on a pro forma basis) would not exceed an amount equal to the greater of €85 million
and 25% of Consolidated EBITDA.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness (“Permitted
**Debt”):**

(1) Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility (including in respect of letters of credit or bankers’
acceptances issued or created thereunder), and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and
Guarantees in respect of such Indebtedness in a maximum aggregate principal amount at any time
outstanding not exceeding (a) the greater of (i) SEK 3,735 million and (ii) 100% of Consolidated EBITDA
_plus (b) the amount of any Guarantee Facilities, plus in the case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness_
permitted under this clause (1) or any portion thereof, the aggregate amount of fees, accrued and unpaid
interest, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs (including redemption premia and defeasance
costs) and expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing;

(2)

(e) Guarantees by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary, so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted under the terms
of the Indenture; or

277


-----

(f) without limiting the covenant described under “—Limitation on Liens,” Indebtedness arising by
reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to any Person securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted under the
terms of the Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Issuer owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a Restricted
Subsidiary owing to and held by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that:

(a) in the case of Indebtedness owing by the Issuer to any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor
(except in respect of intercompany liabilities Incurred in the ordinary course of business or in
connection with cash pooling or cash management or tax positions of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries), such Indebtedness shall be (subject to the Agreed Security Principles and the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement) unsecured and expressly subordinated in right of payment to the
prior payment in full in cash of all obligations with respect to the Notes, in the case of the Issuer,
and the respective Guarantee, in the case of a Guarantor, in each case pursuant to and to the extent
required by the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(b) (i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in any
such Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer; and (ii) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person
other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer, shall be deemed, in each case, to
constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness not permitted by this clause (3) by the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be;

(4) (a) Indebtedness represented by the Notes (other than any Additional Notes) and the Existing Notes
outstanding on the Issue Date, the related Guarantees, and any related “parallel debt” obligations under
the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, (b) any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness
Incurred under the Super Senior Facilities and Indebtedness described in clause (3) of this paragraph)
outstanding on the Issue Date, (c) Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness
described in this clause (4) or clauses (5) and (13) of this paragraph or Incurred pursuant to the first
paragraph of this covenant and (d) Management Advances;

(5) Indebtedness of any Person (a) outstanding on the date on which such Person becomes a Restricted
Subsidiary or any Restricted Subsidiary or is merged, consolidated, amalgamated or otherwise combined
with (including pursuant to any acquisition of assets and assumption of related liabilities) the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary or (b) Incurred to provide all or a portion of the funds utilized to consummate
the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which any Person became a Restricted
Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, with
respect to this clause (5), that on the Applicable Test Date (x) the aggregate amount of such Indebtedness
incurred under this clause (5)(x), together with any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof, does not
exceed the greater of €35 million and 10% of Consolidated EBITDA, or (y)(i) if such Indebtedness is not
Senior Secured Indebtedness, either the Issuer would have been able to Incur €1.00 of additional
Indebtedness pursuant to clause (1) of the first paragraph of this covenant after giving pro forma effect to
the relevant acquisition and the Incurrence of such Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (5) or the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio would not be less than it was immediately prior to giving pro forma effect to such
acquisition or other transaction and the incurrence of such Indebtedness or (ii) if such Indebtedness
constitutes Senior Secured Indebtedness, either the Issuer would have been able to Incur €1.00 of
additional Indebtedness pursuant to clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant after giving pro
forma effect to the relevant acquisition and the Incurrence of such Indebtedness pursuant to this clause
(5) or the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio would not be greater than it was immediately
prior to giving pro forma effect to such acquisition or other transaction and the incurrence of such
Indebtedness or (z) in the case of Acquired Indebtedness, such Indebtedness is discharged within six
months of Incurrence or would otherwise constitute Permitted Debt or Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to
the first paragraph of this covenant;

278


-----

(6) Indebtedness under Currency Agreements, Interest Rate Agreements and Commodity Hedging
Agreements not for speculative purposes (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an
Officer of the Issuer);

(7) Indebtedness consisting of (a) Capitalized Lease Obligations, mortgage financings, Purchase Money
Obligations or other financings, incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price
or cost of construction or improvement of property, plant or equipment used in a Similar Business or (b)
Indebtedness otherwise incurred to finance the purchase, lease, rental or cost of design, construction,
installation or improvement of property (real or personal) or equipment that is used or useful in a Similar
Business, whether through the direct purchase of assets or the Capital Stock of any Person owning such
assets, and any Indebtedness which refinances, replaces or refunds such Indebtedness, either (x) Incurred
in the ordinary course of business or (y) otherwise, in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which,

is repaid within five Business Days of the date on which such Indebtedness is incurred.

For purposes of determining compliance with, and without prejudice to the section “—Financial Calculations,”
and the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with,
this covenant:

(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described
in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may
from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and
type of such Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first paragraph of this
covenant;

(2) all Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date under the Super Senior Facilities shall be deemed initially
Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant and not the first paragraph or clause
(4)(b) of the second paragraph of this covenant, and may not be reclassified;

(3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of
a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred
pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (7), (11), (15) or
(16) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’
acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall
not be included;

(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock
of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or
repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation
preference thereof;

(6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision
permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or
more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(7) for the purposes of determining “Consolidated EBITDA” (x) pro forma effect shall be given to
Consolidated EBITDA on the same basis for calculating the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio for the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries and (y) in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance
Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on a clause of the first or second paragraphs of this covenant
measured by reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, if such
refinancing would cause the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated
based on the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of
Consolidated EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of
such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being
refinanced, plus premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance, costs and fees in connection with
such refinancing;

(8) in the event that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments under a

-----

permission, as applicable, for borrowings and reborrowing thereunder (and including issuance and
creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will, at the Issuer’s option as elected on
the date the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, enters into or increases such
commitments, either (a) be determined on the date of such revolving credit facility, such letter of credit
facility or such increase in commitments (assuming that the full amount thereof has been borrowed as of
such date), and, if such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, Consolidated
Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or Consolidated EBITDA-based permission, as applicable, is satisfied
with respect thereto at such time, any borrowing or reborrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation
of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be permitted under this covenant irrespective
of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Senior Secured Net
Leverage Ratio or Consolidated EBITDA, as applicable, at the time of any borrowing or reborrowing (or
issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the committed amount
permitted to be borrowed or reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’
acceptances) on a date pursuant to the operation of this clause (a) shall be the “Reserved Indebtedness
Amount” as of such date for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Net Leverage
Ratio, Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or Consolidated EBITDA-based permission, as
applicable) and for purposes of subsequent calculations of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated
Net Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or Consolidated EBITDA-based
permission, as applicable, the Reserved Indebtedness Amount shall be deemed to be Incurred and
outstanding, whether or not such amount is actually outstanding, for so long as such commitments are
outstanding or (b) be determined on the date such amount is borrowed pursuant to any such facility or
increased commitment; and

(9) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to
the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original
issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the
form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or
obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of
Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” Except as
otherwise specified, the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value
thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (b) the principal amount, or
liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness. For purposes of determining compliance
with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness Incurred under a Credit Facility, reborrowings of amounts
previously repaid pursuant to “cash sweep” provisions or any similar provisions under a Credit Facility that
provide that Indebtedness is deemed to be repaid daily (or otherwise periodically), including any revolving
indebtedness, shall only be deemed for purposes of this covenant to have been Incurred on the date such
Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on the date of any subsequent reborrowing thereof.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary
shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not
permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the
Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency
shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was
Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or, at the option of the Issuer, first committed (or first Incurred,
whichever yields the lower Euro Equivalent), in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit
facility; _provided_ that; (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a
currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be
exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such eurodenominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded, so long as the principal amount of such

282


-----

Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the definition of Refinancing
Indebtedness; (b) the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue
Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if any
such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect
to the euro) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness
expressed in euro will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result
of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance
other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated
based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is
denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor will incur any Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt) that is contractually
subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor unless such
Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and the applicable Guarantee, if
any, on substantially identical terms; provided, however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually
subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of
being unsecured or by virtue of being secured with different collateral or by virtue of being secured on a junior
priority basis or by virtue of the application of waterfall or other payment ordering provisions affecting different
tranches of Indebtedness. No Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment
to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being
secured on a first or junior Lien basis.

###### Limitation on Restricted Payments

Incurred pursuant to clause (3) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on

Issuer or any Parent in lieu of the issuance of fractional shares of such Capital Stock, provided, however,
that any such payment, loan, advance, dividend or distribution shall not be for the purpose of evading any
limitation of this covenant or otherwise to facilitate any dividend or other return of capital to the holders
of such Capital Stock (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer);

of Indebtedness, the net cash proceeds of which have been contributed to the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries and that has been guaranteed by, or is otherwise considered Indebtedness of, the Issuer or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries incurred in accordance with the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Indebtedness;” and_

(21) so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Restricted Payments of amounts deemed
to not constitute Excess Proceeds pursuant to the third paragraph of the covenant described under
“Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock.”

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of such
Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value of any
cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash Restricted Payment
shall be determined conclusively by an Officer or the Board of Directors of the Issuer acting in good faith.

For the purposes of calculating “Consolidated EBITDA” pro forma effect shall be given to Consolidated
EBITDA on the same basis as for calculating the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio for the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries.

If any Investment or Restricted Payment would be permitted pursuant to one or more provisions described above
and/or one or more of the exceptions contained in the definition of “Permitted Payment” or “Permitted
Investment” (or any other definition used in this covenant or such definitions), the Issuer may, at its sole
discretion, divide and classify such Investment or Restricted Payment in any manner that complies with this
covenant or such definition and may later reclassify in whole or in part any such Investment or Restricted
Payment (based on circumstances existing on the date of such reclassification) in whole or in part at any time,
so long as the Investment or Restricted Payment (as so reclassified) would be permitted to be made in reliance
on the applicable exception as of the date of such reclassification.

###### Limitation on Liens

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or suffer
to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary of the
Issuer), whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any income or
profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien the “Initial Lien”), except (a) in the case
of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral, (1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets
that are not Permitted Liens if the Notes and the Indenture (or a Guarantee of the Notes in the case of Liens of a
Guarantor) are (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) directly secured equally and ratably with, or prior to,
in the case of Liens with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for
so long as such Indebtedness is so secured, and (b), in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral,
Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Notes will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged
upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates, and (ii) otherwise as set forth under “—
_Security—Release of Liens.”_

For the purposes of determining compliance with this covenant and for the purposes of the definitions of
“Permitted Liens” and “Permitted Collateral Liens,” in the event that a Lien meets the criteria of more than one
of the categories or exceptions contained in the definition of, as the case may be, “Permitted Liens” or “Permitted
Collateral Liens” (or any other definition used in this covenant or such definitions), as applicable, the Issuer may,
at its sole discretion, divide and classify such Lien in any manner that complies with this covenant or such

289


-----

definition and may later divide and/or reclassify any such Lien at any time and in any manner that complies with
this covenant or such definition.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of the
Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such
Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such
Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms,
accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference, in each case with respect to such Indebtedness, and
increases in the amount of Indebtedness resulting solely from fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or
increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

###### Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit to exist
or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted
Subsidiary to:

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock to the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary or pay any Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,

provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to
dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the
application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such
an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) the Indenture, the Notes, any Credit Facility (including the
Super Senior Facilities), the Security Documents, any Guarantee and any Intercreditor Agreement and
Additional Intercreditor Agreement or (b) any other agreement or instrument with respect to the Issuer
and its Subsidiaries, in each case, in effect at or entered into on the Issue Date (including the Indenture,
the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents or any related security documents); and
(in all cases) any amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings,
replacements or refinancings of any such agreements or arrangements referred to in this clause (1)
provided that such encumbrances and restrictions are not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole,
with respect to dividend and other payment restrictions than those contained in those agreements as at the
Issue Date (as determined in good faith by the Issuer);

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating to any
Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person entered into on or before the date on which such Person was
acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary, or on which such agreement or instrument is assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred
as consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the transaction
or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was
acquired by the Issuer or was merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary entered into or in connection with such transaction) and outstanding on such date;
_provided that, for the purposes of this clause (2), if another Person is the Successor Issuer or Guarantor_
(each as defined under “—Merger and Consolidation”), any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or
instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed by the Issuer or

290


-----

any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the Successor Issuer or Successor Guarantor, as
applicable;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a refinancing of
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument referred to in
clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3) (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in any
amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this
paragraph or this clause (3); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to
such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less favorable in any
material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the
Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other
modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer);

(4) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or asset
that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment or transfer of any lease,
license or other contract;

(b) contained in mortgages, charges, pledges or other security agreements permitted under the
Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted under the
Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict the transfer of the property or
assets subject to such mortgages, charges, pledges or other security agreements; or

(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in any
reciprocal easement agreements of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capitalized Lease
Obligations permitted under the Indenture, in each case, that impose encumbrances or restrictions on the
property so acquired, or any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to a joint venture agreement that imposes
restrictions on the distribution or transfer of the assets or Capital Stock of the joint venture;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any of its property or assets)
imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect sale or disposition to a Person of
all, or substantially all, the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary (or the property or assets
that are subject to such restriction) pending the closing of such sale or disposition;

(7) customary provisions in leases, licenses, joint venture agreements and other similar agreements and
instruments entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(8) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable rule,
regulation or order, or required by any regulatory authority;

(9) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers under
agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(10) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Currency Agreements, Interest Rate Agreements or
Commodity Hedging Agreements;

(11) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument (a) relating to any
Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if the encumbrances and restrictions contained
in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Holders of
the Notes than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Indenture or the Super Senior
Facilities, together with the security documents associated therewith, or the Intercreditor Agreement, in
each case, as in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) as is customary in comparable financings (as determined
in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer) or where the Issuer determines that
such encumbrance or restriction will not adversely affect in any material respect the Issuer’s ability to

291


-----

make principal or interest payments on the Notes or (b) constituting an Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

(12) restrictions effected in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing that, in the good faith
determination of the Board of Directors or, an Officer or of the Issuer, are necessary or advisable to effect
such Qualified Receivables Financing; or

(13) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any lien permitted under “—Limitation on Liens.”

###### Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any Asset Disposition unless:

(1) the consideration the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives (including by way of relief from, or by
any Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) for such Asset Disposition
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap) is not less
than the fair market value of the assets sold (as determined by the Issuer’s Board of Directors); and

(2) except where the Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75% of the consideration the Issuer
or such Restricted Subsidiary receives in respect of such Asset Disposition or series of related Asset
Dispositions consists of:

(i) cash (including any Net Cash Proceeds received from the conversion within 180 days of such Asset
Disposition of securities, notes or other obligations received in consideration of such Asset
Disposition);

(ii) Cash Equivalents;

(iii) the assumption by the purchaser of (x) any liabilities recorded on the Issuer’s or such Restricted
Subsidiary’s consolidated balance sheet or the notes thereto (or, if Incurred since the date of the
latest balance sheet, that would be recorded on the next balance sheet) (other than Subordinated
Indebtedness), as a result of which neither the Issuer, nor any of the Restricted Subsidiaries remains
obligated in respect of such liabilities or (y) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is no
longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, if the Issuer and each other
Restricted Subsidiary is released from any guarantee of such Indebtedness as a result of such Asset
Disposition;

(iv) Replacement Assets;

(v) any Capital Stock or assets of the kind referred to in clause (D) or (F) in the second paragraph of
this covenant;

(vi) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor received from Persons who
are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, but only to the extent that such Indebtedness (i) has
been extinguished by the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor and (ii) is not Subordinated
Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor;

(vii) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,
having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash
Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at any one time outstanding, not to exceed
the greater of €100 million and 30% of Consolidated EBITDA (with the fair market value of each
issue of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without
giving effect to subsequent changes in value); or

(viii) a combination of the consideration specified in clauses (i) through (vii) of this clause (2).

If the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Disposition, the Net Cash Proceeds of the Asset
Disposition received by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, within 365 days (or 545 days in the circumstances

292


-----

described in clause (H) below) of the later of (i) the date of completion of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the
receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds, may be used by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary to:

(A) (i) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph
of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or any Refinancing Indebtedness in
respect thereof, (ii) unless included in (A)(i), prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Notes or Indebtedness
that is secured by a Lien on the Collateral and that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes,
(iii) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Indebtedness that is not subordinated in right of payment to the
Notes that is secured on assets which do not constitute Collateral, or (iv) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem
any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor (in each case other than Subordinated
Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor or Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary);
_provided_ that the Issuer shall prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Public Debt (other than the Notes)
pursuant to clause (ii) only if the Issuer either (1) reduces the aggregate principal amount of the Notes on
an equal and ratable basis with any such Indebtedness by redeeming Notes or by purchasing Notes through
open-market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions at market prices or (2) makes (at such time
or in compliance with this covenant) an offer to Holders to purchase their Notes in accordance with the
provisions set forth below for an Asset Disposition Offer for an aggregate principal amount of Notes equal
to the proportion that (x) the total aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding bears to (y) the sum
total aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding plus the total aggregate principal amount
outstanding of such Indebtedness (other than the Notes);

(B) (a) purchase any series of Notes pursuant to an offer to all Holders of such Notes at a purchase price in
cash equal to at least 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of
relevant record on the record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) (to the
extent Holders elect not to tender their Notes for such purchase, the amount of Net Available Cash equal
to such amount not tendered shall not increase the amount of Excess Proceeds (as defined below)); or (b)
redeem any series of Notes pursuant to the redemption provisions of the Indenture;

(C) invest in any Replacement Assets;

(D) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Similar Business, if, after
giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Similar Business is or becomes a Restricted
Subsidiary;

(E) make a capital expenditure;

(F) acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock and cash or Cash Equivalents) that are used or useful in a
Similar Business;

(G) consummate any combination of the foregoing; or

(H) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Available Cash pursuant to clause (A), (C), (D), (E) or
(F) of this paragraph or a combination thereof,

_provided that, a binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Available Cash_
from the date of such commitment until the earlier of (x) the date on which such investment is
consummated an[d (]y) the 180th day following the expiration of the aforementioned 365 day period, if the
investment has not been consummated by that date; provided, further that the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary may elect to invest pursuant to clauses (C) through (F) of the above paragraph (or a
combination of the foregoing) prior to receiving the Net Available Cash (provided that such investment
shall be made no earlier than the earliest of notice to the Trustee of the relevant Asset Disposition,
execution of a definitive agreement for the relevant Asset Disposition or consummation of the relevant
Asset Disposition) and deem the amount so invested to be applied pursuant to and in accordance with
clauses (C) through (F) (or a combination of the foregoing).

293


-----

The amount of such Net Available Cash not so used as set forth in this paragraph shall constitute “Excess
_Proceeds” in the following amounts and such determination may be made by the Issuer on any date on or after_
such Asset Disposition at the Issuer’s election (but in each case on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such
Asset Disposition and the use of proceeds therefrom):

(1) if the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio exceeds 4.25 to 1.00, 100% of such Net Available Cash; or

(2) if the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries exceeds 3.75 to
1.00 but does not exceed 4.25 to 1.00, 50% of such Net Available Cash; or

(3) if the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries does not exceed
3.75 to 1.00, 0% of such Net Available Cash,

and any Net Available Cash that will not constitute Excess Proceeds pursuant to this paragraph shall be
immediately available to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries for any purposes permitted by the
Indenture without regard to the periods specified in the second paragraph of this covenant.

Pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash, the Issuer may temporarily reduce revolving credit
borrowings or otherwise invest or use such Net Available Cash in any manner that is not prohibited by the terms
of the Indenture. To the extent that following or in connection with an Asset Disposition the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary has elected to prepay, repay or purchase any amount of Notes or other Senior Secured
Indebtedness (other than the Notes), in each case, at a price of no less than 100% of the principal amount thereof,
and has extended such offer to the Holders of the Notes on at least a pari passu basis to the extent the creditors
in respect of such Senior Secured Indebtedness (including the Holders) elect not to tender their Senior Secured
Indebtedness for such prepayment, repayment or purchase, the Issuer will be deemed to have applied an amount
of Net Available Cash equal to such amount not tendered under this paragraph, and such amount shall not increase
the amount of Excess Proceeds (such amount, together with the aggregate amount described under the sixth
paragraph of this covenant, the “Declined Proceeds”).

On the 36[6th] day (or the 546th day if a binding commitment as described in clause (H) is entered into) after an
Asset Disposition, or such earlier time if the Issuer elects, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds
the greater of €100 million and 30% of Consolidated EBITDA, the Issuer will be required within 10 Business
Days thereof to make an offer (“Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to
all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes
and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of
the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any Pari
Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and 100% of the
principal amount of Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not
including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements
governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof in the case of the Notes.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, any remaining Excess
Proceeds shall constitute “Declined Proceeds” and the Issuer may use such proceeds for any purpose not
otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset
Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively,
exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness to be repaid or purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of
tendered Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such
Indebtedness not denominated in euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal
amounts into their Euro Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset
Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of
Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

294


-----

To the extent that any portion of Net Cash Proceeds payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a currency
other than the currency in which the relevant Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of
such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Notes are denominated that
is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net Cash Proceeds into such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of not less than five
Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later than five Business
Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset Disposition Purchase Date”), the
Issuer will purchase the principal amount of Notes and, to the extent it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness required
to be repaid or purchased by it pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if less than
the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly
tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment, on a
pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness
or portions of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the
Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and
in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will
deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof were accepted for
payment by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of this covenant. The Issuer or the Paying Agent, as the case
may be, will promptly (but, in any case, not later than five Business Days after termination of the Asset
Disposition Offer Period) deliver to each tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase price of the Notes
so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Issuer for purchase, and the
Issuer will promptly issue a new Note (or amend the applicable Global Note), and the Trustee (or an
authenticating agent), upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, will authenticate and deliver (or
cause to be transferred by book-entry) such new Note to such Holder, in a principal amount equal to any
unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount
with a minimum denomination of €100,000. Any Note not so accepted will be promptly delivered (or transferred
by book-entry) by the Issuer to the Holder thereof.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and
any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to the Indenture. To
the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the
Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached
its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

###### Limitation on Affiliate Transactions

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into or
conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any
property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer (any such transaction or series of related
transactions being an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of €17.5 million
and 5% of Consolidated EBITDA unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable
transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such transaction
in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of €50 million
and 15% of Consolidated EBITDA, the terms of such transaction or series of related transactions have
been approved by a resolution of the majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors of
the Issuer resolving that such transaction complies with clause (1) above.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

295


-----

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments,” any Permitted Payments (other than pursuant to clause (9)(b)(ii) of the third_

Investment (other than Permitted Investments as defined in paragraphs (1)(b) and (2) of the definition
thereof);

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, or other

agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other compensation arrangements,
options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any
Parent, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation rights plans, participation
plans or similar employee benefits or consultants’ plans (including valuation, health, insurance, deferred

provided on behalf of officers, employees, directors or consultants approved by the Board of Directors of
the Issuer, in each case in the ordinary course of business;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(4) any transaction between or among the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted Subsidiaries or any

(5) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities (including
under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses provided on behalf of,

directors, officers or employees);

(6) (i) the Transactions, (ii) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Issuer or any of its Restricted

the Issue Date or described in “Related Party Transactions” in the Offering Memorandum, as these
agreements and instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed, replaced or
refinanced from time to time in accordance with the other terms of this covenant or to the extent not more
disadvantageous to the Holders in any material respect, and (iii) the entry into and performance of any
registration rights or other listing agreement;

(7) the execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement or any arrangement pursuant to
which the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or any Parent is required or permitted to file a consolidated tax
return, or the formation and maintenance of any consolidated group for tax, accounting or cash pooling
or management purposes in the ordinary course of business, provided that any such consolidated group
arrangement does not permit or require cash payment by the Issuer to any Parent in excess of the amount
of Tax that would be payable by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis;

(8) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services (including,
without limitation, pursuant to joint venture arrangements), in each case in the ordinary course of business,
which are fair to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of the
Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less
favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Issuer or an Associate or similar entity that would constitute an Affiliate
Transaction solely because the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any Permitted Holder owns an equity interest in or otherwise
controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity;

296


-----

(10) (a) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares) of
the Issuer or options, warrants or other rights to acquire Capital Stock or Subordinated Shareholder

determination and (b) any amendment, waiver or other transaction with respect to any Subordinated
Shareholder Funding in compliance with the other provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable;

(11) (a) payments by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether directly or

Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether directly or indirectly, and including through any

connection with loans, equity, capital market transactions, acquisitions or divestitures, investments or
joint ventures, which payments (or agreements providing for such payments) in respect of this clause (11)
are approved by a majority of the Board of Directors of the Issuer in good faith; and (c) all reasonable out
of pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Investors or any Permitted Holder in connection with its
direct or indirect investment in the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (but, for the avoidance of doubt,

such payment would violate financial assistance restrictions under applicable law);

Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is (i) fair to the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary from a financial standpoint or (ii) on terms not less favorable than might have been obtained

(15) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Receivables Financing.

###### Reports

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee the following reports:

(1) within 120 days of the end of the Issuer’s fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ended December 31,
2024, annual reports containing, to the extent applicable:

(i) an operating and financial review of the audited financial statements, including a discussion of the
results of operation, financial condition, consolidated EBITDA and liquidity and capital resources;

(ii) unaudited pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of the Issuer (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall not include provision of a full income statement or balance sheet to the
extent not reasonably available), together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions,
dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently
completed fiscal year as to which such annual report relates; provided further that, if such pro
forma financial information is not reasonably available, the Issuer will provide, in the case of a
material acquisition, acquired company financials;

297


-----

(iii) the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Issuer as at the end of the most recent fiscal year and
audited consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow of the Issuer for the most
recent two fiscal years, including appropriate footnotes to such financial statements, for and as at
the end of such fiscal years and the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements;

(iv) a description of the business, management and shareholders of the Issuer, all material affiliate
transactions, and a description of all material debt instruments; and

(v) a description of material operational risk factors and material subsequent events.

(2) within 60 days of the end of the first, second and third fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the Issuer
beginning with the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2024, quarterly financial statements of the Issuer
containing the following information:

(i) the Issuer’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as at the end of such quarter and
unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow for the most recent quarter year to date
period ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date and the comparable prior period,
together with condensed footnote disclosure;

(ii) unaudited pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of the Issuer, together with
explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have
occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as to which such quarterly
report relates (provided that such pro forma financial information will be provided only to the
extent available without unreasonable expense, in which case the Issuer will provide, in the case
of a material acquisition, acquired company financials);

(iii) an operating and financial review of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of
the consolidated financial condition, results of operations, consolidated EBITDA and material
changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Issuer;

(iv) a discussion of material changes in material debt instruments since the most recent report; and

(v) material subsequent events and any material changes to the risk factors disclosed in the most recent
annual report, provided that the information described in clauses (iv) and (v) may be provided in
the footnotes to such financial statements; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Issuer announces publicly or any acquisition,
disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction that is material to the Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or a senior executive officer or director changes at the Issuer or a change
in auditors of the Issuer, a report containing a description of such event.

So long as the Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will also, within five Business Days after furnishing to the Trustee
the annual and quarterly reports required by clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this “Reports” covenant,
hold a conference call to discuss such reports and the results of operations for the relevant reporting period. The
Issuer shall provide notice of the conference call no fewer than three Business Days prior to the date of the
conference call required to be held in accordance with this paragraph, announcing the time and date of such
conference call and either including all information necessary to access the call or directing parties to contact the
appropriate person at the Issuer to obtain such information.

In addition, the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of such parties,
any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for so long as the
Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by persons who are not “affiliates” under the Securities
Act.

Contemporaneously with the furnishing of each such report discussed above, the Issuer will also post such report
on the Issuer’s website.

298


-----

The Issuer shall also make available to Holders and prospective holders of the Notes copies of all reports
furnished to the Trustee on the Issuer’s website and if and so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of
The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited and to the extent that the rules and regulations of The
International Stock Exchange Authority Limited so require, by posting such reports on the official website of
The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (www.tisegroup.com/). Notwithstanding the above, the
Issuer will be deemed to have provided such reports to the Trustee, the Holders and prospective holders of the
Notes if such reports referenced above in clauses (1), (2) and (3) have been posted on the Issuer’s website.

All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of such
report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis for
the periods presented, except as may otherwise be described in such information; provided, however, that the
reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods
on a basis that applied to such periods. No report need include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries
of the Issuer or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical
disclosure not of a type included in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, the reports set forth above will not
be required to contain any reconciliation to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

With respect to any period or comparable period, as the case may be, for which financial information of the Issuer
does not exist for the full length of such period, the financial information or comparable period financial
information of the Company or special purpose financial information of the Issuer (incorporating such Company
financial information) may be provided in lieu thereof.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may satisfy its obligations under clauses (1) and (2) of the first
paragraph of this covenant by delivering the corresponding consolidated annual and quarterly reports of any
Parent. To the extent that material differences exist between the management, business, assets, shareholding or
results of operations or financial condition of the Issuer or any Parent that is the reporting entity (if applicable),
the annual and quarterly reports shall include an explanation and an unaudited reconciliation of such material
differences. Following an IPO on the Capital Stock of the Issuer or any Parent or Subsidiary thereof and/or the
listing of such Capital Stock on an internationally recognized stock exchange, the requirements of this covenant
shall be considered to have been fulfilled if the IPO Entity complies with the reporting requirements of such
stock exchange and reports consolidated EBITDA and, if the IPO Entity is different than the Issuer following
such IPO, and material differences exist between the assets, results of operations or financial condition of the
IPO Entity and the Issuer, then the reports shall include an explanation and an unaudited reconciliation of such
material differences.

At any time that any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the
Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first paragraph of this “—Reports”
covenant will include (i) a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in
the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of
the Issuer or (ii) stand-alone audited or unaudited financial statements, as the case may be, of such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or Unrestricted Subsidiaries, together with an unaudited reconciliation to the financial information of
the Issuer and its subsidiaries, which reconciliation shall include the following items: revenues, consolidated
EBITDA, net income, cash, total assets, total debt, shareholder equity, capital expenditures and interest expense.

For the purposes of this covenant, IFRS shall be deemed to be IFRS as in effect from time to time, without giving
effect to the proviso in the definition thereof.

All reports provided pursuant to this “—Reports” covenant shall be made in the English language.

In the event that (i) the Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports required by
Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Issuer elects to provide to the Trustee reports which, if filed with the SEC,
would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Issuer) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of

299


-----

the Exchange Act (other than the provision of U.S. GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or information as
to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Trustee such
annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the
SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d). Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Issuer will be
deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture to the contrary, any failure to comply with this covenant shall be
automatically cured, prior to acceleration of the relevant breach, when the Issuer or any direct or indirect Parent
of the Issuer, as the case may be, makes available all required reports to the Trustee or makes such required
reports available on the Issuer’s website (or a website of a Parent or Subsidiary of the Issuer).

Delivery of the above reports to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee’s receipt of such
reports will not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from
information contained therein, including the Issuer’s or any other parties’ compliance with any of its covenants
in the Indenture (as to which the Trustee will be entitled to rely exclusively on Officer’s Certificates that are
delivered).

###### Merger and Consolidation

 The Issuer

The Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose
of all or substantially all the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in one
transaction or a series of related transactions to, any Person, unless:

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Issuer”) will be a Person organized and
existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union, the United Kingdom or the United
States of America, any State of the United States or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province of
Canada, Norway or Switzerland and the Successor Issuer (if not the Issuer) will expressly assume, (a) by
supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee, all the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture and (b) all obligations of the
Issuer under the Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security Documents, as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the Successor Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Successor Issuer as a result of such transaction
as having been Incurred by the Successor Issuer or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no
Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Successor Issuer would be able to Incur
at least an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio contained in the
first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b) the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio would not be less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to
the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply
with the Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture (if any) has
been duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal, valid and binding agreement enforceable
against the Successor Issuer (in each case, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee),
_provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any_
matters of fact.

Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is deemed to be
Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of any such transaction
undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto, shall be
deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

300


-----

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Issuer, which properties and assets,
if held by the Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties and
assets of the Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the
properties and assets of the Issuer.

The Successor Issuer will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the
Issuer under the Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the predecessor company
will not be released from its obligations under the Indenture or the Notes.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve
“all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this “—Merger and
_Consolidation” covenant) shall not apply to (i) any transactions which constitute an Asset Disposition if the_
Issuer has complied with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”
or (ii) the creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary or (iii) the Post-Closing Merger.

###### Guarantors

No Guarantor (other than a Guarantor whose guarantee is to be released in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement) may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving
corporation);

(2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of, all or substantially all of the assets of such
Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one transaction or a series of related
transactions, to any Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into it unless:

(A) the other Person is the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or becomes a
Guarantor;

(B) (1) either (x) a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or transferee
Person (the “Successor Guarantor”) expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor
under its Guarantee and the Indenture (pursuant to a supplemental indenture executed and
delivered in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee); and (2) immediately after giving effect
to the transaction, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing; or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger)
of a Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of a Guarantor (in each
case other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Indenture,

_provided, however, that the prohibition in clauses (1), (2) and (3) of this paragraph shall not apply to the extent_
that compliance with paragraphs (A) and (B)(1) could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation of
statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules,
capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws rules or regulations (or analogous
restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case
of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a
Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3)
any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out of pocket
expenses.

The provisions set forth in this “—Merger and Consolidation” covenant shall not restrict (and shall not apply
to): (i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor from consolidating with, merging or liquidating into or

301


-----

transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer, a Guarantor or any other Restricted
Subsidiary; (ii) a Guarantor from merging or liquidating into or transferring all or part of its properties and assets
to the Issuer or another Guarantor; (iii) any consolidation or merger of the Issuer into any Guarantor; provided
that, if the Issuer is not the surviving entity of such merger or consolidation, the relevant Guarantor will assume
the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable, and clauses (1) and (4) under the heading
“—The Issuer” shall apply to such transaction (iv) a Permitted Reorganization and (v) the Issuer or a Guarantor
changing legal domicile or legal form or consolidating into or merging or combining with an Affiliate
incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of such entity, reincorporating such
entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such entity; provided, however, that clauses (1), (2)
and (4) under the heading “—The Issuer” or clauses (3)(A) and (3)(B) under the heading “—Guarantors,” as the
case may be, shall apply to any such transaction.

###### Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status

If, on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no Default or
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning on that day and
continuing until such time, if any, at which the Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (the “Reversion
**Date”), the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply to the Notes:**

(1) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(2) “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

(3) “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(4) “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

(5) “—Impairment of Security Interest”;

(6) “—Future Guarantees”;

(7) “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”; and

(8) the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Merger and
_Consolidation—The Issuer,”_

and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be
applicable to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first day on
which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard
to actions of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during the continuance of the
Suspension Event, and no action taken prior to the Reversion Date will constitute a Default or Event of Default.
The “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date
of the Indenture but not during the continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness
Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue
Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” In addition, the Indenture will also permit, without causing a Default or
Event of Default, the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any contractual commitments or take
actions in the future after any date on which the Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long as the
contractual commitments were entered into during the Suspension Event and not in anticipation of the Notes no
longer having an Investment Grade Status. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes that
the conditions set forth in the first paragraph under this caption have been satisfied, _provided_ that, no such
notification shall be a condition for the suspension or reversion of the covenants described under this caption to
be effective. The Trustee shall not be obliged to notify the Holders of such event. There can be no assurance that
the Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Status.

###### Impairment of Security Interest

The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, and the Parent shall not, take or knowingly
or negligently omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security Interest
with respect to the Collateral (it being understood, subject to the proviso below, that the Incurrence of Permitted
Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interest with respect
to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any
Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the
Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral, except that (i) the Issuer
and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Permitted Collateral Liens and may effect a Permitted Reorganization
and an IPO Pushdown or IPO Release, and the Collateral may be discharged and released and retaken, and the
applicable Security Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise
modified, replaced or released, if applicable, in accordance with the Indenture, the applicable Security
Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (ii) the applicable Security
Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified, replaced or
released, from time to time to (a) cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect or inconsistency therein, (b)
comply, or in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
(c) add Collateral, (d) evidence the succession of another Person to the Issuer or any security provider and the
assumption of such successor of the obligations under the Indenture, the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement and/or
the Security Documents, in each case, including in accordance with the terms under “—Merger and Consolidation,”
(e) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of the appointment of a successor Trustee or Security Agent and (f)
in any manner that does not adversely affect Holders of the Notes in any material respect, and (iii) the Issuer and
its Restricted Subsidiaries may discharge and release Security Interests with respect to the Collateral in connection
with the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization and an IPO Pushdown or IPO Release; provided, however,
that in the case of clause (i) above, except with respect to any discharge or release in accordance with the
Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Incurrence of Permitted
Collateral Liens or any action expressly permitted by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents may not be amended, extended, renewed, restated,
supplemented, released and retaken, if applicable, or otherwise modified or replaced, unless contemporaneously
with any such action, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee and the Security Agent, either (1) a solvency opinion, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and the Security Agent from an Independent Financial
Advisor confirming the solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or
replacement, (2) a certificate from the Board of Directors of the relevant Person which confirms the solvency of
the person granting such Security Interest after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement or (3) an Opinion of Counsel,
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and the Security Agent, confirming that, after giving
effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release,
modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Security Documents, so amended, extended,
renewed, restated, supplemented, released, modified or replaced are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any
limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise
subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release,
modification or replacement.

In the event that the Issuer complies with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent
shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such amendments without the need for
instructions from the Holders.

###### Future Guarantees

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this covenant, no Restricted Subsidiary shall Guarantee the
Indebtedness outstanding under the Super Senior Facilities, any other Indebtedness with an aggregate outstanding
principal amount in excess of the greater of €85 million and 25% of Consolidated EBITDA or any other Public

303


-----

Debt, in each case of the Issuer or a Guarantor unless such Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor on
the date on which the Guarantee is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental
indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Guarantee, which Guarantee will be senior
to or pari passu with such Restricted Subsidiary’s guarantee of such other Indebtedness; provided, however, that
such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be obligated to become such a Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the
Incurrence of such Guarantee is contrary to the Agreed Security Principles or the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, or could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation of statutory
limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, capital
maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of
any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted
Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted
Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost,
expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out of pocket
expenses. At the option of the Issuer, any Guarantee may contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the extent
reasonably necessary.

Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under “—Release of the Guarantees.”
A Guarantee of a Guarantor may also be released at the option of the Issuer if at the date of such release either
(i) there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which
could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture if such Guarantor had not been designated as a
Guarantor, or (ii) there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date
and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture as at the date of such release if such
Guarantor were not designated as a Guarantor as at that date. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take
all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Guarantee in accordance with these provisions,
subject to customary protections and indemnifications.

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the
Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other
things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial
assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and
similar principles. By virtue of such limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be
significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no
obligation under its Guarantee.

The validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of each Guarantor
will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in “Risk Factors” and “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” in the Offering_
Memorandum.

###### Release of the Guarantees

The Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and release:

(1) upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital Stock of the
relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company) or the sale or disposition of all
or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary)
otherwise permitted by the Indenture;

(2) upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(3) upon (i) defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and
_Discharge” or (ii) the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the Issuer and the_
Guarantors under the Indenture and the Notes;

304


-----

(4) with respect to a Guarantor that is not a Significant Subsidiary, so long as no Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, to the extent that such Guarantor is unconditionally released and discharged from its
liability with respect to the Super Senior Facilities and is not otherwise required to be a Guarantor pursuant
to the covenant described under “— Future Guarantees”;

(5) in accordance with an enforcement action pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

(6) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(7) as described in the covenant described under “—Future Guarantees”;

(8) pursuant to a Permitted Reorganization or as a result of a transaction permitted by “—Merger and
_Consolidation—Guarantors,” or in connection with a transaction permitted by “—IPO Pushdown;” or_

(9) upon the solvent liquidation or winding-up of a Guarantor.

At the request of the Issuer, the Trustee shall take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or
waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release
of a Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each
of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee without the consent of the Holders. Neither the
Trustee nor the Issuer will be required to make a notation on the Notes to reflect any such release, termination or
discharge.

###### Additional Intercreditor Agreements

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the Incurrence by the Issuer or its
Restricted Subsidiaries of any Indebtedness permitted pursuant to the covenant described under “— Limitation
_on Indebtedness” or as contemplated by the Intercreditor Agreement, the Issuer, the relevant Restricted_
Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their
duly authorized Representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) or a
restatement, amendment or other modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same
terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders), including containing
substantially the same terms with respect to release of Guarantees and priority and release of the Security Interest;
_provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee_
or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights,
duties, liabilities, indemnifications or immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Indenture or the
Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders, the Trustee
and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or any Security Document to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect
or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such
agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement
(including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of
provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes), (3) add Restricted
Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Notes
(including Additional Notes), (5) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure
Additional Notes, (6) implement any Permitted Liens or Permitted Collateral Liens, (7) amend the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof or (8) make any other
change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect. The Issuer shall
not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement
without the consent of the Holders of the majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding,
except as otherwise permitted below under “—Amendments and Waivers” or as permitted by the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee
and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal

305


-----

obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect
their respective rights, duties, liabilities, indemnifications or immunities under the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the Holders to the payment,
repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations
subordinated to the Notes thereby; provided, however, that such transaction would comply with the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

The Indenture also will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and
accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
(whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have
directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement. A copy of
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall be made available for inspection
during normal business hours on any Business Day upon prior written request at our offices or at the offices of
the listing agent.

###### Maintenance of Listing

The Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the listing of the Notes on the Official List of
The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited for so long as such Notes are outstanding; provided that if
at any time the Issuer determines that it will not maintain such listing, it will obtain prior to the delisting of the
Notes from the Official List of The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited, and thereafter use its
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain, a listing of such Notes on another recognized stock exchange.

###### Lines of Business

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, engage in any business other than a Similar
Business, except to such extent as would not be material to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole.

###### Financial Calculations

Any Applicable Metric to be determined in connection with an Applicable Transaction (including whether a
Default or Event of Default is continuing or would result from the Applicable Transaction) may, at the Issuer’s
election (which election the Issuer may revoke and re-make at any time and from time to time), be determined
as at any Applicable Test Date, in each case, where relevant and at the Issuer’s election (which election the Issuer
may revoke and re-make at any time and from time to time), based upon the financial position as at the Applicable
Reporting Date immediately preceding such Applicable Test Date. If the Issuer elects to determine any
Applicable Metric as of any Applicable Test Date, such Applicable Metric shall be calculated on a pro forma
basis after giving effect to such Applicable Transactions and to any other Applicable Transactions that have
occurred up to (and including) such Applicable Test Date as if they occurred on the first day of the most recently
completed Relevant Period to which the Applicable Reporting Date relates; _provided that the pro forma_
calculation may exclude any non-recurring fees, costs and expenses attributable to any Applicable Transaction.

If compliance with an Applicable Metric is established in accordance with the preceding paragraph, such
Applicable Metric shall be deemed to have been complied with (or satisfied) for all purposes under the Indenture;
_provided that: (a) the Issuer may elect (which election the Issuer may revoke and re-make at any time and from_
time to time) to recalculate any Applicable Metric on the basis of a more recent Applicable Test Date, in which
case, such date of redetermination shall thereafter be deemed to be the relevant Applicable Test Date for purposes
of such Applicable Metric; and (b) save as contemplated in paragraph (a) above, compliance with any Applicable
Metric shall not be determined or tested at any time after the relevant Applicable Test Date for such transaction
and any actions or transactions related thereto.

If any Applicable Metric for which compliance was determined or tested as of an Applicable Test Date would at
any time after the Applicable Test Date have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been complied with as a

306


-----

result of fluctuations in such Applicable Metric (or any other Applicable Metric), such Applicable Metric will
not be deemed to have been exceeded or failed to have been complied with as a result of such fluctuations.

If any related requirements and conditions (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of
Default) for which compliance or satisfaction was determined or tested as of any Applicable Test Date would at
any time after the Applicable Test Date not have been complied with or satisfied (including due to the occurrence
or continuation of a Default or Event of Default), such requirements and conditions will not be deemed to have
been failed to be complied with or satisfied (and such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed not to have
occurred or be continuing).

If any Applicable Metric is determined by reference to the greater of a fixed amount (the “Numerical
**Permission”) and a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA (the “Grower Permission”) and the Grower**
Permission of the Applicable Metric exceeds the applicable Numerical Permission at any time, the Numerical
Permission shall be deemed to be increased to the highest amount of the Grower Permission reached from time
to time and shall not subsequently be reduced as a result of any decrease in the Grower Permission.

For any relevant Applicable Metric set by reference to a fiscal year, a calendar year, a four-quarter period, a
twelve-month period or any other similar annual period (each an “Annual Period”):

(i) at the option of the Issuer, the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric during such
Annual Period may be increased by: (A)(x) an amount equal to 100% of the difference (if positive)
between the permitted amount in the immediately preceding Annual Period and the amount thereof
actually used or applied by the Group during such preceding Annual Period and (y) an amount equal to
any unused capacity accumulated from the Existing Notes Issue Date to, but excluding, the Issue Date,
under the corresponding Applicable Metric in the Existing Notes Indenture (the “Carry Forward
**Amount”); and/or (B) an amount equal to 100% of the permitted amount in the immediately following**
Annual Period and the permitted amount in such immediately following Annual Period shall be reduced
by such corresponding amount (the “Carry Back Amount”); and

(ii) to the extent that the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric during such Annual
Period is increased in accordance with clause (i) above, any usage of such Applicable Metric during
such Annual Period shall be deemed to be applied in the following order: (A) first, against the Carry
Forward Amount; (B) second, against the maximum amount so permitted during such Annual Period
prior to any increase in accordance with clause (i) above; and (C) third, against the Carry Back Amount.

For the avoidance of doubt, subject to clause (8) of the third paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation
_on Indebtedness,” any undrawn commitments for Indebtedness (including the Super Senior Facilities (which_
includes the Pension Guarantee Facility and the Guarantee Facilities) and any ancillary facility thereunder) shall
be disregarded for the purposes of testing any Applicable Metric.

###### Events of Default

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest or Additional Amounts on any Note issued under the Indenture when
due and payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under the
Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon
declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or (following the Post-Closing Merger) the Parent
to comply for 60 days after written notice by the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount
of the outstanding Notes with its other agreements contained in the Indenture (other than a default in
performance, or breach, of a covenant or agreement which is specifically addressed in clauses (1) or (2)
above);

307


-----

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there
may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries)
other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or
Guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at Stated Maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately upon
the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross acceleration
**provision”),**

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of
any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of which has
been so accelerated, aggregates in excess of €25 million or more;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary or
group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial
statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the
“bankruptcy provisions”);

(6) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together
(as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries),
would constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of €25 million
(exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability for), which
judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the judgment becomes final (the
“judgment default provision”);

(7) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect
(other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement,
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture and except through the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Trustee or Security Agent) with respect to Collateral having a fair market value
in excess of €10 million for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the
Indenture or the release of any such security interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents or any such
security interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Issuer shall assert in
writing that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable, and (in each case) any such Default
continues for 10 days; and

(8) any Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance
with the terms of such Guarantee or the Indenture) or is declared invalid or unenforceable in a judicial
proceeding or any Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations under its Guarantee and (in
each case) any such Default continues for 10 days.

However, a default under clause (3), (4) or (6) above will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or
the Holders of 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture notify the Issuer of the
default and, with respect to such clauses the Issuer does not cure such default within the time specified in such
clauses, as applicable, of this paragraph after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is continuing,
the Trustee by notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes
under the Indenture by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such
Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes under
the Indenture to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid
interest will be due and payable immediately. The Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any Default or
Event of Default unless a written notice of any event which is in fact such a default is received by a Responsible

308


-----

Officer of the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and such notice references the Notes and the
Indenture. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in
clause (4) above under “–Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of
the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of
Default pursuant to clause (4) above shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness,
or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days
after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes
would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events
of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest on the Notes that became due solely because of
the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any,
and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any
declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may
not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all past
or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or
Additional Amounts, if any) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences
if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and
is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture
at the request or direction of any of the Holders, unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee, and the Trustee
has received, indemnity and/or security (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to the Trustee against any
loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no
Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes, unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue
the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability
or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer
of security and/or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a
direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given
the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, of which a
responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the
Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in
the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law
or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that
would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be
entitled to indemnification and/or security (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to it in its sole
discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. Prior to the occurrence of

309


-----

an Event of Default, the Trustee will have no obligation to monitor compliance by the Issuer with the Indenture.
The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and a responsible officer of the Trustee is
informed in writing in accordance with the terms of the Indenture of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee
must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the
case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may
withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders.
The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s
Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during
the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof,
written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what
action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection
with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure
to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any
further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed
in the covenant entitled “Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant
to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required
by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed
period specified in the Indenture.

The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but
only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured (including by way of pre-funding) to its satisfaction. It may not
be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances
the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for
Holders to take action directly.

###### Amendments and Waivers

Subject to certain exceptions, the Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified with
the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents
obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) and, subject to certain
exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders
of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection
with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes). However, without the consent of Holders holding
not less than 90% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes affected, then outstanding, an amendment
or waiver may not, with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, waiver or
modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Note or change the time at which any Note may
be redeemed, in each case as described above under “—Optional Redemption”;

(5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Note;

(6) impair the right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or with respect
to such Holder’s Notes;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “—Withholding Taxes” that adversely
affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends the terms of such Notes
in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an

310


-----

exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder, unless the Issuer or
the applicable Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(8) release all or substantially all of the security interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the
Collateral other than in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture or the applicable Security Documents;

(9) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest or
Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by
the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment
default that resulted from such acceleration);

(10) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Guarantee or the Indenture, except in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement any applicable Additional
Intercreditor Agreement; and

(11) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent described in
this sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Security Agent and
the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Notes Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer, or any Restricted
Subsidiary under any Notes Document;

(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any right or
power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or that
does not adversely affect the rights or benefits to the Trustee or any of the Holders in any material respect
under the Notes Documents;

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer
of the Issuer) for the issuance of Additional Notes;

(6) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Guarantee in accordance with the covenants
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “—Certain Covenants— Future
_Guarantees,” to add Guarantees with respect to the Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of the Notes,_
or to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Guarantee or Lien
(including the Collateral and the Security Documents) or any amendment in respect thereof with respect
to or securing the Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking or amendment is provided
for under the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Notes to any provision of this
“Description of the Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of the Notes” was intended
to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Notes;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee or Security Agent pursuant
to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee or Security Agent to any Notes
Document;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in
favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Super Senior Facilities, in any
property which is required by the Security Documents or the Super Senior Facilities (as in effect on the
Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required to be

311


-----

granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a security interest in the Collateral for
the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such security interest is not prohibited by the
Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” is complied with; or

(10) as provided in “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements.”

In formulating its decision on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely absolutely on such
evidence as it deems necessary, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed
amendment of any Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed
amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder of Notes given in
connection with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

###### Acts by Holders

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Notes have concurred in any
direction, waiver or consent, the Notes owned by the Issuer or by any Person directly or indirectly controlled, or
controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the Issuer will be disregarded and deemed not to
be outstanding.

###### Defeasance

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and the
Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain
obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and
indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning
issuing temporary Notes, registration of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of
an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the
Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate (other than with
respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate its and the Guarantors’ obligations under the covenants described under
“Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (1) and (2) of “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”) and
“—Change of Control” and the default provisions relating to such covenants described under “Events of Default”
above, the operation of the cross-default upon a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the
bankruptcy provisions with respect to the Issuer and Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision, the
guarantee provision and the security default provision described under “Events of Default” above (“covenant
**defeasance”).**

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of
its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of a series of Notes
may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to such series of Notes. If the Issuer exercises
its covenant defeasance option with respect to a series of Notes, payment of such series of Notes may not be
accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3), (4), (5) (with respect only to the Significant
Subsidiaries), (6) or (7) under “Events of Default” above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option of a series, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the
“defeasance trust”) with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed as agent by the Trustee for this
purpose) cash in euros or euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a combination thereof
sufficient for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on such series of the Notes to redemption
or maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee
of:

312


-----

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that the beneficial owners of the Notes will not
recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and
defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner
and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and
in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United States must be based on a
ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating,
hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to customary
assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to legal
defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with;

(4) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not constitute, or is
qualified as, a regulated investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended; and

(5) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee all other documents or other information that the Trustee may reasonably
require in connection with either defeasance option.

###### Satisfaction and Discharge

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except
as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Notes, as expressly provided for in the
Indenture) as to all outstanding Notes when: (1) either: (a) all the Notes previously authenticated and delivered
(other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes, and certain Notes for which provision for payment was
previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Paying
Agent for cancellation; or (b) all Notes not previously delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation (i) have
become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to
be called for redemption within one year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving
of notice of redemption by the Paying Agent in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has
deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another entity designated by the Trustee for this purpose),
money or euro-denominated European Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, as applicable, in an
amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Notes not previously delivered to the Paying
Agent for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Notes that
have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Issuer
has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; (4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable
instructions to the Trustee to apply the funds deposited towards the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the
redemption date, as the case may be; and (5) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and
an Opinion of Counsel each to the effect that all conditions precedent under the “Satisfaction and Discharge”
section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with,
_provided_ that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to
compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).

###### No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer or any of their respective Subsidiaries
or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor under the Notes
Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each
Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the
consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S.
federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

###### Concerning the Trustee

Deutsche Trustee Company Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will provide
that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has
received written notice in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Trustee will perform only such duties
as are set forth specifically in the Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default of which a responsible
officer of the Trustee has received written notice in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Trustee will
exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of care that a
prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain
from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the
Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any
such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Issuer
and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced. Such terms
will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the then outstanding Note, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Issuer
and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated, or (b) becomes
incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any
Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six months may petition any court for removal of the
Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the
successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, taxes, expenses
incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising out of or in connection with
the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

###### Notices

For so long as any of the Notes are listed on The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited and the rules
of The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited so require, notices with respect to the Notes will be
published, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, on the official website of The International
Stock Exchange Authority Limited (www.tisegroup.com/). In addition, for so long as any Notes are represented
by Global Notes, all notices to Holders of the Notes will be delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer to Euroclear
and Clearstream.

All notices to Holders of the Notes will be validly given if mailed to them at their respective addresses in the
register of Holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more than
once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are mailed, such
notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after being so
mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or
other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed.
Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with
respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given,
whether or not the addressee receives it. For so long as any Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices to
Holders of the Notes may be delivered via Euroclear and Clearstream in lieu of notice via registered mail.

###### Prescription

Claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the Notes will
be prescribed 10 years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against the Issuer and the

314


-----

Guarantors for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed five years after the applicable due date for
payment of interest.

###### Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions

The euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the Guarantors, if
any, under or in connection with the Notes and the Guarantees, if any, including damages. Any amount received
or recovered in a currency other than euro, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of
a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by any
Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a Guarantor will only
constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the euro amount which the
recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that
receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is
practicable to do so).

If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under any
Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors, if any, will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or
the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors, if any, will indemnify the recipient or the
Trustee on a joint or several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency
indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Note or the
Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources of information used)
the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent
obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent
cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Note or the Trustee (other than
a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment,
order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or any Guarantee, or to
the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any eurodenominated restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a noneuro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such noneuro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

###### Listing

Application will be made to list the Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange Authority
Limited. There can be no assurance that the application to list the Notes on the Official List of The International
Stock Exchange Authority Limited will be approved and settlement of the Notes is not conditioned on obtaining
such listing.

###### Enforceability of Judgments

Since substantially all the assets of the Issuer are located outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the
United States against the Issuer, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest,
Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Notes, may not
be collectable within the United States.

###### Consent to Jurisdiction and Service

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and the Notes,
the Issuer will in the Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough
of Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State of New York, United States.

###### Governing Law

The Indenture and the Notes, and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. For the avoidance of doubt, the governing law
of the Indenture and the Notes may be amended with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal
amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender

315


-----

offer or exchange offer for, Notes). The Intercreditor Agreement and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales.

include the full run rate effect of cost savings, operating expense reductions, restructuring charges,
operating improvements, expenses, synergies or similar initiatives that are reasonably anticipated to be
realized within the next 24 months following the date of such calculation) as if they had occurred on the
first day of the Relevant Period; provided that, if definitive documentation has been entered into with
respect to a Purchase that is part of the transaction causing a calculation to be made hereunder,
Consolidated EBITDA for such period will be calculated after giving pro forma effect to such Purchase
(including the full run rate effect of cost savings, operating expense reductions, restructuring charges,
operating improvements, expenses, synergies or similar initiatives that are reasonably anticipated to be
realized within the next 24 months following the date of such calculation) as if such Purchase had occurred
on the first day of such period, even if the Purchase has not yet been consummated as of the date of
determination;

(2) the Consolidated EBITDA (whether positive or negative) attributable to discontinued operations, as
determined in accordance with IFRS, and operations, businesses or group of assets constituting a business
or operating unit (and ownership interests therein) disposed of prior to the Applicable Test Date, will be

(taking into account the full run rate effect of cost savings, operating expense reductions, restructuring
charges, operating improvements, expenses, synergies or similar initiatives that are reasonably anticipated
to be realized within the next 24 months following the date of such calculation, resulting from any such
disposal, as determined in good faith by a responsible accounting or financial officer of the Issuer);

(3) the Consolidated Interest Expense attributable to discontinued operations, as determined in accordance
with IFRS, and operations, businesses or group of assets constituting a business or operating unit (and
ownership interests therein) disposed of prior to the Applicable Test Date, will be excluded on a pro forma

326


-----

basis as if such disposition occurred on the first day of the Relevant Period, but only to the extent that the
obligations giving rise to such Consolidated Interest Expense will not be obligations of the Issuer or any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries following the Applicable Test Date;

(4) any Person that is a Restricted Subsidiary on the Applicable Test Date will be deemed to have been a
Restricted Subsidiary at all times during the Relevant Period;

(5) any Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary on the Applicable Test Date will be deemed not to have
been a Restricted Subsidiary at any time during the Relevant Period; and

(6) if any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest, the interest expense on such Indebtedness will be
calculated as if the rate in effect on the Applicable Test Date had been the applicable rate for the Relevant
Period (taking into account any Interest Rate Agreement applicable to such Indebtedness), and if any
Indebtedness is not denominated in the Issuer’s functional currency, that Indebtedness for purposes of the
calculation of Consolidated Net Leverage shall be determined in accordance with IFRS.

For the purposes of this definition and the definitions of Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Net Income, calculations will be as determined
in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer (including in respect of the full run
rate effect of anticipated cost savings, operating expense reductions, restructuring charges, operating
improvements, expenses, synergies or similar initiatives that are reasonably anticipated to be realized within the
next 24 months following the date of such calculation) as though the full effect of such cost savings, operating
expense reductions, restructuring charges, operating improvements, expenses, synergies or similar initiatives
were realized on the first day of the Relevant Period and shall also include the reasonably anticipated full run
rate effect (as calculated in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer) of cost
savings, operating expense reductions, restructuring charges, operating improvements, expenses, synergies or
similar initiatives that have been or will be initiated by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries and are reasonably
anticipated to be realized within the next 24 months following the date of such calculation as though such cost
savings, operating expense reductions, restructuring charges, operating improvements, expenses, synergies or
similar initiatives had been fully implemented on the first day of the Relevant Period, provided that such
anticipated cost savings, operating expense reductions, restructuring charges, operating improvements, expenses,
synergies or similar initiatives (i) are not duplicative of cost savings, operating expense reductions, restructuring
charges, operating improvements, expenses, synergies or similar initiatives already included in such calculation
for such period and (ii) such anticipated cost savings and synergies under clauses (1) and (2) above do not exceed
25% of Consolidated EBITDA for such period (calculated prior to giving pro forma effect to such synergies and
cost savings, but not other items or types of adjustments, including those under clause (12) of the definition of
Consolidated EBITDA).

###### BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM

 General

Each series of Notes sold within the United States to “qualified institutional buyers” in reliance on Rule 144A
will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached
(the “Rule 144A Global Notes”). On the Issue Date, the Rule 144A Global Notes representing each series of
the Notes will be deposited with a common depository and registered in the name of the nominee of the common
depository for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Each series of Notes sold outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act will
initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
“Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). On the
Issue Date, the Regulation S Global Notes representing each series of the Notes will be deposited with a
common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of
Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the “Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests”) and ownership
of interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the
Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts
with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that hold interests through such participants. Euroclear and
Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities
accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories. Except under the limited
circumstances described below, Book-Entry Interests will not be issued in definitive form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained
in book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The Book-Entry Interests in the Global
Notes will be issued only in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.
The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit a
participant’s account on their book-entry transfer and registration systems with the interest beneficially owned
by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require
that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of those securities in definitive form. The foregoing
limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes
are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not be considered the owners or “holders” of Notes for
any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary of Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or its
respective nominees), will be considered the sole holders of the Global Notes for all purposes under the
Indenture. In addition, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and indirect
participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and the participants through which they
own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders of Notes under the
Indenture.

None of the Issuer, the Guarantors or any of the Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the Paying Agent, the Registrar or
any of their respective agents will have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records relating to
the Book-Entry Interests.

3 6


-----

###### Definitive Registered Notes

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive Notes in registered
form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”) only in the following circumstances:

(i) if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as
depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days; or

(ii) the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear or
Clearstream following an “Event of Default” under the Indenture.

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest
described in the immediately preceding clause (ii), their current procedure is to request that the Issuer issue or
cause to be issued Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests and not only to the
owner who made the initial request.

In such an event, the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and
issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream or the Issuer, as
applicable (in accordance with its respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from
participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes
will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the Indenture, unless that legend is not required by the Indenture
or applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, any Transfer Agent and the Registrar
shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person
will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced through
registration from time to time at the registered office of the Issuer, and such registration is a means of evidencing
title to the Notes.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the Book-Entry
Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear
and/or Clearstream, as applicable.

The Issuer will not be required to register the transfer or exchange of Definitive Registered Notes for a period
of 15 calendar days preceding (i) the record date for any payment of interest on the Notes, (ii) any date fixed
for redemption of the Notes or (iii) the date fixed for selection of the Notes to be redeemed in part. The Issuer
is also not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Notes selected for redemption or which the holder
has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a change of control offer or asset sale offer.
In the event of the transfer of any Definitive Registered Note, the Trustee may require a holder, among other
things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents as described in the Indenture. The Issuer
may require a holder to pay any transfer taxes and fees required by law and permitted by the Indenture and the
Notes.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such a Definitive Registered Note has
been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Note is mutilated and is surrendered
to the Registrar or at the office of a transfer agent, the Issuer will issue and the Trustee (or an authentication
agent appointed by it) will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and the
Issuer’s requirements are met. The Issuer or the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a
Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both to protect
themselves, the Registrar or the Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which any of
them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. The Issuer, Registrar and Trustee may charge for
any expenses incurred by it in replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

3


-----

If any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to become
due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by the Issuer pursuant to the provisions of the
Indenture, the Issuer, in its discretion, may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or
purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged only after the transferor first delivers to the
Trustee a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply
with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

###### Redemption of the Global Notes

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount
received by them in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection
with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The
Issuer understands that, under the existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes
are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on
a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions), by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and
appropriate; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000 principal amount may be
redeemed in part.

###### Payments on Global Notes

The Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal,
premium, if any, interest and additional amounts, if any) to the Paying Agent, which will make payments to
Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, such payments will be credited to participants’ accounts in accordance
with their customary procedures. The Issuer expects that standing customer instructions and customary practices
will govern payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar
and any of their respective agents will treat the registered holders of the Global Notes (e.g., the common
depositary (or its respective nominee)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all
other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the
Registrar or any of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

- any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to,
or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the
records of Euroclear or Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments
made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

- any other matter relating to the actions and practices of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or
indirect participant (including payments made); or

- the records of the common depositary.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility of
such participant.

-----

###### Currency of Payment for the Global Notes

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of Notes will be
paid to holders of interests in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in euro.

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any regulations of
the applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Initial Purchasers, the
Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or any of their respective agents will be liable to any holder of
a Global Note or any other person for any commissions, costs, losses or expenses in relation to or resulting from
any currency conversion or rounding effected in connection with any such payment. Holders may be subject to
foreign exchange risks that may have economic and tax consequences to them.

###### Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of a
Note (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described above) only at the direction of one or more
participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of
such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have
given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents,
waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default
under the relevant Notes, Euroclear and Clearstream, at the request of the holders of such Notes, reserve the
right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes, and to distribute such Definitive Registered
Notes to their participants.

###### Transfers

Transfers between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in accordance with Euroclear’s and
Clearstream’s rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder of a Note requires physical
delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes to persons in states that require
the physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder of Notes must transfer its
interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth under “Transfer Restrictions.” Book-Entry Interests
in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements discussed under
“Transfer Restrictions.”

Transfers of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A Book-Entry
Interests will at all times be subject to such transfer restrictions.

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Regulation
S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in
the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 or any
other exemption (if available under the Securities Act).

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Rule
144A Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided
in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes
is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements
of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions”
and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction.

3 9


-----

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the
Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only
as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only if the transferor
first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such
transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Transfer
_Restrictions.”_

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest
in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly
will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry
Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

###### Pledges

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect
participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a Book-Entry Interest to pledge such interest to persons
or entities who or that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in
respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some
jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently,
the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited.

###### Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable. We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience
of investors. The operations and procedures of the settlement system are controlled by the settlement system
and may be changed at any time. Neither the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the
Registrar nor any of the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those operations or procedures.

The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold
securities for participating organizations. They facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions
between their participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such participants. Euroclear
and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration,
clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream
interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such
as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect
access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust
companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant,
either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can act only on behalf of participants, who or that in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to
persons or entities who or that do not participate in the Euroclear and/or Clearstream system, or otherwise take
actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The
laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form.
Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of

360


-----

beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the
144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

###### Special Timing Considerations

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving the Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems are open
for business. In addition, because of time zone differences, there may be complications with completing
transactions involving Euroclear and/or Clearstream on the same business day as in the United States. United
States investors who or that wish to transfer their interests in the Notes, or to receive or make a payment or
delivery of Notes, on a particular day, may find that the transactions will not be performed until the next business
day in Brussels, if Euroclear is used, or in Luxembourg, if Clearstream is used.

###### Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of the Exchange.
Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in
the ordinary way in accordance with their respective system’s rules and operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers
of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, they are under no obligation to
perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any
time. None of the Issuer or any of the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the
Registrar or the Paying Agent will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or
their participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing
their operations.

###### Initial Settlement

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euros. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or
Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in registered form.
Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders
on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value of the settlement date.

###### Secondary Market Trading

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear and Clearstream and will settle in same
day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading
of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that
settlement can be made on the desired value date.

###### CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS

 U.S. Federal Income Taxation

The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and
disposition of Notes by a U.S. Holder (as defined below). This summary deals only with initial purchasers of
Notes at the “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of Notes is sold for money, excluding
sales to underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) in the initial offering that are U.S. Holders and that will
hold the Notes as capital assets. The discussion does not cover all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that
may be relevant to, or the actual tax effect that any of the matters described herein will have on, the acquisition,
ownership or disposition of Notes by particular investors (including consequences under any alternative
minimum tax, net investment income tax or special rules for the taxable year of inclusion for accrual basis
taxpayers under Section 451(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”)), and does not
address any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or
any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. This summary also does not discuss all of the tax considerations that may
be relevant to certain types of investors subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws
(such as financial institutions, insurance companies, regulated investment companies, real estate investment
trusts, individual retirement accounts and other tax-deferred accounts, tax-exempt organizations, dealers in
securities or currencies, investors that will hold the Notes as part of straddles, hedging transactions or
conversion transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes, persons that have ceased to be U.S. citizens or
lawful permanent residents of the United States, investors holding the Notes in connection with a trade or
business conducted outside of the United States, U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents living abroad or
investors whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar).

As used herein, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of Notes that is, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, (i) an individual citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation (or other entity treated as a
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized under the laws of the United States, any
state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income
tax without regard to its source or (iv) a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary
supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all
substantial decisions of the trust, or the trust has validly elected to be treated as a domestic trust for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

The U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S.
federal income tax purposes that holds Notes will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the
partnership. Prospective purchasers that are entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal
income tax purposes should consult their tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences to
them and their partners of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of Notes by the partnership.

This summary is based on the tax laws of the United States including the Code, its legislative history, existing
and proposed regulations thereunder, published rulings and court decisions, all as of the date hereof and all
subject to change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service (“IRS”) have been or are expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can
be no assurance that the IRS will not take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the acquisition,
ownership or disposition of the Notes or that any such position would not be sustained.

**AND EFFECT OF STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. AND OTHER TAX LAWS AND POSSIBLE CHANGES**
**IN TAX LAW.**

###### Payments of Stated Interest

 General

It is expected, and this discussion assumes, that the Notes will not be issued with original issue discount for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, payments of stated interest on a Note (without reduction for any
amounts withheld and including payments of any Additional Amounts) generally will be taxable to a U.S.
Holder as ordinary income at the time it is received or accrued, depending on such U.S. Holder’s method of
accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Prospective purchasers should consult their tax advisors
concerning the applicability of the foreign tax credit and source of income rules to income attributable to the
Notes.

###### Foreign Currency Denominated Interest

The amount of income recognized by a cash basis U.S. Holder will be the U.S. dollar value of the Euro interest
payment, based on the spot rate of exchange in effect on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment
is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. A cash basis U.S. holder will not recognize foreign currency exchange
gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such stated interest, but may have exchange gain or loss attributable
to the actual disposition of the Euros so received.

An accrual basis U.S. Holder may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to an interest
payment denominated in Euros in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, the amount
of income accrued will be based on the average exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual period (or, in
the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. Holder, the part of the period within each
taxable year).

Under the second method, the U.S. Holder may elect to determine the amount of income accrued on the basis
of the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans
two taxable years, the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the part of the period within each taxable year).
Additionally, if a payment of interest is actually received within five business days of the last day of the accrual
period, an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder may instead translate the accrued interest into U.S. dollars at the
exchange rate in effect on the day of actual receipt. Any such election will apply to all debt instruments held by
the U.S. Holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by
the U.S. Holder, and will be irrevocable without the consent of the IRS.

Upon receipt of the interest payment (including a payment attributable to accrued but unpaid interest upon the
sale or retirement of a Note) denominated in foreign currency, the accrual basis U.S. Holder may recognize U.S.
source exchange rate gain or loss (taxable as U.S.-source ordinary income or loss) equal to the difference
between the amount received (translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date of receipt) and the amount
previously accrued, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars.

**_IPO Pushdown_**

The terms of the Notes provide that, in certain circumstances, the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes may
be assumed by a subsidiary of the Issuer (see “Description of the Notes – IPO Pushdown”). Any such
assumption might be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a deemed disposition of Notes by a U.S.
Holder in exchange for “new notes” issued by the IPO Pushdown Entity. As a result of this deemed exchange,
a U.S. Holder could be required to recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to
the difference, if any, between the issue price of the “new notes” (as determined for U.S. federal income tax

363

purposes), and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Notes (although any such loss could be disallowed).
A U.S. Holder would also have a new holding period and new tax basis in the “new notes” for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. In addition, if the fair market value of the “new notes” at the time of the IPO Pushdown
was less than the principal amount of the “new notes” (by more than a statutorily defined de minimis amount),
you may be required to include the difference as ordinary income as it accrues (on a constant yield to maturity
basis) in advance of the receipt of cash. To the extent that the IPO Pushdown Entity acquires substantially all
of the assets of the Issuer and the transaction does not result in a change in payment expectations or a significant
alteration, such assumption generally should not be treated as a deemed exchange of the Notes for “new notes”.
U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences to them of
a change in obligor with respect to the Notes.

###### Sale, Exchange, Redemption, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes

A U.S. Holder generally will recognize gain or loss on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other
taxable disposition of a Note equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale, exchange,
redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis of the Note, in each
case as determined in U.S. dollars. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note generally will be its U.S. dollar
cost of such Note to such U.S. Holder. The amount realized does not include the amount attributable to accrued
but unpaid interest, which will be taxable as interest income (as discussed above under “—Payments of Stated
_Interest”) to the extent not previously included in income. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors_
about how to account for proceeds received on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable
disposition of Notes that are not paid in U.S. dollars.

A U.S. Holder will recognize U.S. source exchange rate gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) on
the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note equal to the difference, if any,
between the U.S. dollar values of the U.S. Holder’s purchase price for the Note (i) on the date of sale, exchange,
redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition and (ii) the date on which the U.S. Holder acquired the Note.
In addition, upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder
may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated
interest and, which will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of Stated Interest”. Any such
exchange rate gain or loss, including any exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of accrued but unpaid
interest, will be realized only to the extent of total gain or loss realized on such disposition.

Except to the extent of changes in exchange rates, gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on the sale or
retirement of a Note will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the Note was held
by the U.S. Holder for more than one year. Non-corporate U.S. Holders generally are subject to tax on longterm capital gains at reduced rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

Gain or loss realized by a U.S. Holder on the sale or retirement of a Note generally will be U.S. source.
Prospective purchasers should consult their tax advisors as to the foreign tax credit implications of the sale or
retirement of Notes.

###### Backup Withholding and Information Reporting

Payments of principal and interest on the Notes, and the proceeds of a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement
or other taxable disposition of Notes, by a U.S. paying agent or other U.S. intermediary will be reported to the
IRS and to the U.S. Holder as may be required under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations. Backup withholding
may apply to these payments if the U.S. Holder fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number or
certification of exempt status or fails to comply with applicable certification requirements. Certain U.S. Holders

364


-----

are not subject to backup withholding. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors as to their qualification
for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining an exemption.

###### Reportable Transactions

A U.S. taxpayer that participates in a "reportable transaction" will be required to disclose its participation to the
IRS. Under the relevant rules, if the Notes are denominated in a foreign currency, a U.S. Holder may be required
to treat a foreign currency exchange loss from the Notes as a reportable transaction if this loss exceeds the
relevant threshold in the regulations (U.S.$50,000 in a single taxable year, if the U.S. Holder is an individual
or trust, or higher amounts for other non-individual U.S. Holders), and to disclose its investment by filing Form
8886 with the IRS. A penalty in the amount of U.S.$10,000 in the case of a natural person and U.S.$50,000 in
all other cases generally is imposed on any taxpayer that fails to timely file an information return with the IRS
with respect to a transaction resulting in a loss that is treated as a reportable transaction. Prospective purchasers
are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing disclosure requirements to their
ownership of the Notes and any other reporting obligations that may apply to the ownership or disposition of
Notes, including requirements related to the holding of certain specified foreign financial assets and the
significant penalties that may result from non-compliance with any of these disclosure or reporting obligations.

###### Certain Swedish tax considerations

The following summary of certain tax considerations that may arise as a result of holding Notes is based on
current Swedish tax legislation and is intended only as general information for holders of Notes who are resident
in Sweden for tax purposes, unless otherwise indicated. This description does not deal comprehensively with
all tax consequences that may occur for holders of Notes and is neither intended to be nor should be construed
as legal or tax advice. For instance, it does not cover the specific rules where Notes are held by a partnership or
as current assets in a business operation. Moreover, the description does not address situations where Notes are
held in an investment savings account (Sw. investeringssparkonto) or through an endowment insurance (Sw.
_kapitalförsäkring). The summary does not address the rules regarding reporting obligations for, among others,_
payers of interest. Special tax consequences that are not described below may also apply for certain categories
of taxpayers, including investment companies and mutual funds. Prospective purchasers of Notes should consult
their own tax advisers for information with respect to the special tax consequences that may arise as a result of
acquiring, holding and disposing of Notes, including the applicability and effect of foreign income tax rules,
provisions in double taxation treaties and other rules which may be applicable.

###### Taxation of individuals tax resident in Sweden

_Capital gains and losses. Individuals who sell their Notes, or have their Notes redeemed or bought back, are_
subject to capital gains tax. The tax rate is 30 per cent.

The capital gain or loss is calculated as the difference between the sales (or redemption) proceeds, after
deduction of sales costs, and the Notes’ acquisition cost for tax purposes. The acquisition cost is determined
according to the “average method”. This means that the acquisition value for all Notes of the same class and
type shall be added together and computed collectively, with respect to changes to the holding.

Gains or losses on currency exchange rate fluctuations may arise in relation to Notes where the sales proceeds
received are in a foreign currency. However, no special calculations are required if the sales proceeds are
exchanged into SEK within 30 days from the time of disposal. In such case, the exchange rate on the date of

36


-----

exchange shall be used when calculating the value of the sales proceeds. The exchange rate on the date of
acquisition is generally used when determining the acquisition cost for tax purposes.

As a general rule, 70 per cent. of a capital loss is deductible against any other taxable income from capital.
However, capital losses on listed Swedish receivables are fully deductible in the income from capital category.
According to Swedish case law, full deductibility also applies to capital losses on listed foreign receivables.

If a net loss arises in the income from capital category, a reduction of the tax on income from employment and
from business operations, as well as the tax on real estate and the municipal real estate fee, is allowed. The tax
reduction is 30 per cent. of any part of the net loss not exceeding SEK 100,000 and 21 per cent. of any part of
the net loss in excess of SEK 100,000. An excess net loss may not be carried forward to a subsequent fiscal
year.

_Interest. Any interest income received by an individual Noteholder is subject to Swedish tax at a tax rate of 30_
per cent. in the income from capital category. Interest income is taxable when the income can be disposed of.

_Withholding of tax on interest. The legal entity effecting an interest payment to an individual (or an estate of a_
deceased individual) will normally be required to withhold Swedish preliminary tax (Sw. preliminärskatt). The
preliminary tax withheld is normally equal to the final tax on the interest income, which means that there is
generally no further tax payable on the interest.

###### Taxation of Swedish limited liability companies

For limited liability companies (Sw. aktiebolag), all income, including interest and capital gains on the Notes,
is taxed as income from business operations at a flat rate of 20.6 per cent. Deductible capital losses on the Notes
may normally be fully off-set against income from business operations.

Interest income and currency exchange fluctuations are normally taxable, or deductible, as the case may be, on
an accrual basis.

Specific rules may apply to Notes held as a hedge for foreign currency exposure.

###### Taxation of holders of Notes that are not tax resident in Sweden

Payments of any principal amount or any amount that is considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes to
a Noteholder are not subject to Swedish income tax, provided that such a holder is not resident in Sweden for
Swedish tax purposes and provided that such a holder does not have a permanent establishment in Sweden to
which the Notes are effectively connected.

Swedish withholding tax, or Swedish tax deduction, is not imposed on payments of any principal amount or
any amount that is considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes to a non-resident holder of Notes.

Holders of Notes who are not resident in Sweden for Swedish tax purposes and who are not carrying on business
operations from a permanent establishment in Sweden to which the Notes are attributable are generally not
liable for Swedish capital gains taxation on the disposal of Notes. The holders of Notes may be subject to tax
in their country of residence.

###### PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION

The Issuer, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, J.P. Morgan SE, Danske Bank A/S, DNB Bank ASA, Sweden
Branch, Nordea Bank Abp, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (publ) and Swedbank AB (publ), as Initial
Purchasers, have entered into a purchase agreement dated on or around the date of this offering memorandum
with respect to the Notes (the “Purchase Agreement”).

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the Issuer has agreed to sell to the
Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase from the Issuer, the entire principal amount
of the Notes.

The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to purchase
Notes from the Issuer, are several and not joint.

The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the issue price that appears on the cover
of this offering memorandum for the Notes. After the initial Offering, the Initial Purchasers may change the
Offering’s price for the Notes and any other selling terms without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and
sell Notes in the United States through certain of their affiliates or through United States registered broker
dealers. In the Purchase Agreement, we have agreed that:

- the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the relevant Notes are subject
to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain opinions by their counsel;

- during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including the date that is 90 days
after such date, none of the Issuer or the Guarantors will offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose
of any debt (including, without limitation, any debt securities, loans or other debt instruments), issued
or guaranteed by any of the Issuer or the Guarantors and having a tenor of more than one year (other
than the Notes); and

- the Issuer and the relevant Guarantors will indemnify the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates
against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and/or will contribute to payments
that the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may be required to make in respect of those
liabilities.

- the Issuer has agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for their services in connection
with the Offering and to reimburse them for certain out-of-pocket expenses. Persons who purchase Notes
from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in accordance
with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the issue price set forth on the cover
page hereof. Certain affiliates of the Issuer may purchase a portion of the Notes in the Offering.

DNB Bank ASA, Sweden Branch (“DNB”) is not registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
as a U.S. registered broker-dealer and does not intend to participate in any offer of sale of the Bonds of the
within the United States but, to the extent that the offering by DNB is in the United States, DNB will offer to
and place securities with investors through DNB Markets, Inc., an affiliated U.S. broker-dealer.

Nordea Bank Abp (“Nordea”) is not registered as a U.S. broker-dealer and consequently will not effect any
offers or sales of any Notes in the United States unless intermediated by Nordea Securities LLC, an affiliated
U.S. registered broker-dealer. Nordea’s activities in United States will be effected only to the extent permitted
by Rule 15a-6 under the Exchange Act.

Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (publ) (“SEB”) is not a U.S. registered broker-dealer and therefore, intends
to participate in the offering outside of the United States and, to the extent that the offering by SEB is in the
United States, it will offer to and place securities with investors through SEB Securities, Inc., an affiliated U.S.

36


-----

broker-dealer. The activities of SEB in the United States will be effected only to the extent permitted by Rule
15a-6 under the Exchange Act.

Swedbank AB (publ) (“Swedbank”) is not an U.S. registered broker-dealer and accordingly Swedbank will
only effect offers and sales of the Notes solely outside of the United States in accordance with Regulation S.

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other
jurisdiction. In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has agreed that the Notes may not be offered or
sold within the United States except pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act or in transactions not subject to those registration requirements, including sales pursuant to Rule
144A and Regulation S.

In addition, until 40 days following the later of (i) the commencement of the Offering and (ii) the Issue Date,
an offer or sale of Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering) may
violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act unless the dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance
with Rule 144A or another exemption from registration under the Securities Act. During this 40-day period,
neither Clearstream nor Euroclear will monitor compliance by dealers with the Securities Act.

The Notes are a new issue of securities, and there is currently no established trading market for the Notes. In
addition, the Notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Transfer
_Restrictions.” We do not intend to apply for the Notes to be listed on any securities exchange other than the_
Official List of the Exchange or to arrange for the Notes to be quoted on any quotation system. The Initial
Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes, but they are not obligated to do so.
The Initial Purchasers may discontinue any market making in the Notes at any time in their sole discretion. In
addition, such market making activities will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act and other applicable legal requirements. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid trading market
will develop for the Notes, that you will be able to sell your Notes at a particular time or that the prices that you
receive when you sell will be favorable.

In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers may engage in overallotment, stabilizing transactions
and syndicate covering transactions. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the Offering size, which creates
a short position for the Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the Notes in the open
market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. Syndicate covering transactions
involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover
short positions. Stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions may cause the price of the Notes
to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of those transactions. If the Initial Purchasers engage in
stabilizing or syndicate covering transactions, they may discontinue them at any time.

It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the date specified
on the cover page of this offering memorandum, which will be the      business day following the date of
pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+     ”). Under Rule 15(c)6-1 of the
Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in one business day, unless the
parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the
date of pricing or the next successive      business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes
initially will settle in T+    , to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent
a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing should consult
their own advisor.

In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser, severally and not jointly, has represented and agreed that:

- it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything
done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom; and

368


-----

- it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of
Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances
in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or the Guarantors.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by the Issuer
or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or
distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction
where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or
indirectly, and neither this offering memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in
connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in
compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This offering
memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction
where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum
comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the
distribution of this offering memorandum and resale of Notes. See “Notice to Certain Investors.”

Certain of the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates from time to time have performed, and in the future will
perform, banking, investment banking, advisory, consulting and other financial services including hedging
services for the Issuer and its affiliates, for which they may receive customary advisory and transaction fees
and reimbursement of expenses. Each Initial Purchaser is also involved in the Super Senior Facilities. In
addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make
or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative
securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their
customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our
affiliates. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with us routinely
hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such
Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions that consist of
either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including
potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of
the Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations
or publish or express independent research views in respect of the Issuer, the Group, such securities or financial
instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long or short positions in such securities
and instruments.

###### CERTAIN INSOLVENCY CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS

Set forth below is a summary of certain limitations on the enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the security
interests in some of the jurisdictions in which the Note Guarantees or the Collateral are being provided. It is a
summary only, and proceedings of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event could be initiated in any of these
jurisdictions and in the jurisdiction of organization of a future guarantor of the Notes. The application of these
various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply and
could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights and collect payment in full under the Notes, the Note
Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral. Also set forth below is a brief description of certain
aspects of insolvency law in Sweden, Norway and Finland.

###### European Union

The Guarantors in Sweden, Norway and Finland are organized under the European Economic Area.

Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on insolvency
proceedings (recast), as amended, in particular by Regulation (EU) 2018/946 of the European Parliament and
of the Council of 4 July 2018, published in the Official Gazette of the European Union on July 6, 2018 (the
“EU Insolvency Regulation”), was published in the Official Gazette of the European Union on June 5, 2015.

The EU Insolvency Regulation applies within the European Union (other than Denmark), to public collective
insolvency proceedings as defined therein and listed in its Annex A. It provides that the courts of the Member
State in which a debtor’s “center of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency
Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to commence main insolvency proceedings relating to such debtor. The
determination of where a debtor has its center of main interests is a question of fact on which the courts of the
different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views.

Pursuant to Article 4 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, a court requested to open insolvency proceedings is
required to examine whether it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 3 and, pursuant to Article 5, such decision
may be challenged by the debtor or any creditor on grounds of international jurisdiction.

Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation provides that the center of main interests, or “COMI” of a “debtor
shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is
ascertainable by third parties”. It sets forth, as explained by Recital (30), a rebuttable presumption that a debtor
has its COMI in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary.
This presumption shall only apply if the registered office of the legal person has not been moved to another
Member State within the 3-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Recital
(30) provides that it should be possible to rebut this presumption if a debtor’s central administration is located
in a Member State other than that of its registered office and a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant
factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the debtor’s actual center of
management and supervision and the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. Under
the previous EU insolvency regulation (Council Regulation (EC) 1346/2000 of 29 May 2000), which defined
the COMI in similar terms, the courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in determining a
debtor’s COMI, including in particular where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts
the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors
are established. A debtor’s COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is determined
for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings at
the time of the filing of the insolvency petition.

3 0


-----

If a debtor’s COMI is and will remain located in the Member State (other than Denmark) in which it has its
registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the EU Insolvency Regulation
would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to
commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation.
Insolvency proceedings commenced in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be
recognized in the other EU Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be
commenced in another Member State.

If a debtor’s COMI is in a Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency
Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to commence secondary
(territorial) insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if such debtor has an “establishment” (within the
meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member
State or had an establishment in such EU Member State in the 3-month period prior to the request for
commencement of main insolvency proceedings. An “establishment” is defined to mean “any place of
operations where the debtor carries out or has carried out in the 3-month period prior to the request to commence
main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets”.

Where main proceedings have been commenced in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI, any
proceedings commenced subsequently in another Member State in which the debtor has an establishment shall
be secondary insolvency proceedings. The effects of such proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor
situated in the territory of such other Member State. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the
debtor has its COMI have not yet been commenced, pursuant to Article 3 (4) of the EU Insolvency Regulation,
secondary insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State where the debtor has an
establishment where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the
debtor’s COMI is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the secondary insolvency proceedings are
commenced at the request of (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an
establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is
requested or (ii) a public authority that has the right to make such a request under the law of the Member State
in which the establishment is located. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary
insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex for
concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency
proceedings of the debtor. Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of
the Member State within the territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with
its Article 3 shall have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is
closely linked with them, such as avoidance actions. The opening of insolvency proceedings in a Member State
pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation shall not affect the rights in rem of creditors or third parties in respect
of tangible or intangible, moveable or immoveable assets, both specific assets and collections of indefinite
assets as a whole that change from time to time, belonging to the debtor that are situated within the territory of
another Member State at the time of the opening of proceedings. Rights in rem include:

(a) the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the proceeds of or
income from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a mortgage;

(b) the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in respect of the claim
or by assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee;

(c) the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or use of
them contrary to the wishes of the party so entitled;

(d) a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets.

3 1


-----

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court commencing
main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary
proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in a Member State
that has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s COMI is located there) may exercise
the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets
of the debtor from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations, as long as no insolvency proceedings
have been commenced in that other Member State or no preservation measures have been taken to the contrary
further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has
assets.

Pursuant to Article 21 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner appointed by the court of
the main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of the Member State in which the
main proceedings are located in another Member State as long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened
in such other Member State or any preservation measure to the contrary has been taken there further to a request
to open insolvency proceedings in such other Member State. He may, in particular, subject to the preservation
of third parties’ right in rem pursuant to Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation and to the preservation of
the sellers’ rights based on a reservation of title pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, remove
assets of the company from that other Member State.

However, under Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency
proceedings may attempt to avoid the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State
by 243 giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which secondary
insolvency proceedings could be opened that the distribution of those assets or of the proceeds received as a
result of their realization, will comply with the distribution and priority rights that would apply under the
relevant national law if secondary insolvency proceedings were opened in such other Member State. Such
undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by known local creditors. The rules on qualified
majority and voting that apply to the adoption of restructuring plans under the laws of the Member State shall
also apply to the approval of the undertaking. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate
and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it shall, at the request of the insolvency
practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceedings if it is satisfied that the
undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors.

Additionally, under Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual
enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and its
creditors, the court, at the request of the company or of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency
proceedings, may stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding three
months, provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local creditors.

Under Article 46 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court that opened the secondary insolvency proceedings
will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part upon receipt of a request from the insolvency
practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a period of up to three months, unless such a request is
manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency proceedings. Such stay may be continued or
renewed for similar periods. Where the court stays the process of realization of the assets, the court may require
the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the
interests of the creditors in the secondary insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors.

The EU Insolvency Regulation provides:

(a) for cooperation and communication between insolvency practitioners of the main insolvency
proceedings and of the secondary insolvency proceedings and, in order to facilitate the coordination of

3 2


-----

main, territorial and secondary insolvency proceedings concerning the same debtor for cooperation and
communication between (i) courts and (ii)insolvency practitioners and courts;

(b) for specific cooperation, communication and coordination measures in order to ensure the efficient
administration of insolvency proceedings relating to different companies forming part of the same group;

(c) that the Member States shall establish and maintain a register of insolvency proceedings; and,

(d) that the European Commission shall establish a decentralized system for the interconnection of the
insolvency registers referred to under (b).

The United Kingdom ceased to be a member of the EU on January 31, 2020, 11.00 p.m. (“exit day”) and has
now entered its transition period. The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended by the European
Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020) provides that direct EU legislation (which term includes any EU
regulation as it has effect in EU law immediately before exit day (subject to certain exceptions)) shall form a
part of domestic law on and after exit day until the end of the transition period. In addition, whilst direct EU
legislation may continue to form a part of domestic law, it may be subject to a number of amendments. The
Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/146) sets out a number of amendments to be
made to the Recast Regulation. However, there remains considerable uncertainty regarding the final terms of
the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU, and related regulatory changes.

**_EU Directive on preventive restructuring frameworks_**

The EU Directive 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and the Council of 20 June 2019 on preventive
restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency
of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU)
2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency) (the “EU Restructuring Directive”) was published on
June 26, 2019.

The objectives of the EU Restructuring Directive are to ensure that (i) viable enterprises and entrepreneurs that
are in financial difficulties have access to effective national preventive restructuring frameworks that enable
them 244 to continue operating, (ii) honest insolvent or over-indebted entrepreneurs (i.e. individuals) can
benefit from a full discharge of debt after a reasonable period of time, thereby affording them a second chance
and (iii) the effectiveness of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt is improved,
in particular with a view to shortening their length.

The Restructuring Directive aims to achieve a higher degree of harmonization in the field of restructuring,
insolvency, discharge of debt and disqualifications by establishing substantive minimum standards for
preventive restructuring procedures as well as for procedures leading to a discharge of debt for entrepreneurs
in order to promote a culture that encourages early preventive restructuring to address financial difficulties at
an early stage, when it appears likely that insolvency can be prevented and the viability of the business can be
ensured. Most notably, the Restructuring Directive provides for a framework pursuant to which (a) a stay of
individual enforcement actions by creditors against debtors must be introduced by Member States national
legislation, (b) all creditor claims shall be grouped into separate classes each of which shall reflect a
commonality of interests (at a minimum, creditors of secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in separate
classes), (c) creditor claims may be restructured in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not
more than 75% of (i) the amount of the claims in each class and, (ii) where the Member State so requires, the
number of affected parties in each class and (d) a cross-class cram-down is introduced whereby a restructuring
plan may, under certain conditions, be adopted and bind dissenting creditors even if the creditors of one or more
classes do not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority. The transposition of the Restructuring
Directive into national legislation shall protect new financing and interim financing and may also provide
priority ranking to new or interim financing granted in the context of the restructuring.

3 3


-----

The EU Restructuring Directive shall be transposed into national laws or regulations by Member States by July
17, 2021 (with the exception of the provisions relating to the use of electronic means of communication for
which the time period for the transposition expires in certain respects on July 17, 2024, or, in others, on July
17, 2026), subject to a maximum 1 year extension of the transposition period for Member States encountering
particular difficulties in implementing the EU Restructuring Directive.

###### Sweden

 Applicable Insolvency Law

Certain Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Sweden (each a “Swedish Obligor”). To the extent that
such companies have their center-of-main interests in Sweden, Swedish bankruptcy law is applicable, subject
to the provisions of the EU-Insolvency Regulation. As a starting point and by virtue of Article 4 of the EU
Insolvency Regulation, insolvency proceedings applicable to a Swedish Obligor may be governed by Swedish
insolvency law (lex fori concursus).

###### Insolvency Proceedings

Pursuant to chapter 1, section 2 of the Swedish Bankruptcy Act (Sw. konkurslagen (1987:672)), if a company
is unable to pay its debts when due and such inability is not merely temporary, it is deemed insolvent and can
be declared bankrupt following a bankruptcy petition filed with the court by (i) the debtor or (ii) by a creditor
of the debtor.

In the event of bankruptcy, the court will appoint a receiver (Sw. konkursförvaltare) in bankruptcy who will
work in the interest of all creditors with the objective of realizing the debtor’s assets and distribute the proceeds
among the creditors.

The purpose of bankruptcy proceedings is to wind up the company in such a way that the company’s creditors
receive as high a proportion of their claims as possible. The receiver in bankruptcy is required to safeguard the
assets and can decide to continue the business or to close it down, depending on what is best for all creditors.
In general, the receiver in bankruptcy is required to sell the assets of the debtor as soon as possible and to
distribute the proceeds. In the interim, the receiver will take over the management and control of the company
and the company’s directors and/or managing director will no longer be entitled to represent the company or
dispose of the company’s assets.

When distributing the proceeds, the receiver must follow the mandatory provisions of the Swedish Rights of
Priority Act (Sw. förmånsrättslagen (1970:979)), as amended from time to time, that states the order in which
creditors have a right to be paid. As a general principle, in bankruptcy proceedings competing claims have equal
right to payment in relation to the size of the amount claimed from the debtor’s assets.

In case of enforcement outside of bankruptcy proceedings in respect of certain types of assets, such as over
shares, receivables, bank accounts, trademarks and contractual rights, enforcement can be carried out by the
security holder itself. A provision granting the secured party or its agent such right of enforcement is typically
included in any pledge agreement between the pledgor and the secured party or its agent. The secured party is
typically entitled to enforce the security through a sale of the collateral. However, certain restrictions apply to
the procedure for such a sale. In general, when enforcing the security, the secured party is under a duty of care
in relation to the security provider and the security granted. The security provider should, if the circumstances
are not exceptional, be given prior notice of the contemplated enforcement and also of the time and location of
the sale. Furthermore, sufficient notice should be given to prospective purchasers in order to create reasonable
preconditions for a market price being obtained in the sale. Where the secured party has been granted the right
to enforce the security through a private sale, such sale must be made to a party unaffiliated with the secured
party unless the market price of the security can be independently and objectively established and the security

3 4


-----

is sold at such price. Pledges over receivables and other claims are, if the receivable or claim has fallen due,
normally enforced through the secured party collecting the payment as opposed to selling the receivable.

Enforcement of security in bankruptcy is also subject to certain restrictions. A secured party holding a
possessory pledge over movable property (such as shares) may arrange for the sale of the movable property at
a public auction. Such secured party must however give the receiver in bankruptcy an opportunity to arrange
payment of the debtor’s debt to the creditor in order to redeem the movable property to the bankruptcy estate,
and the movable property may not, without the consent of the receiver in bankruptcy, be sold earlier than four
weeks after the estate inventory meeting (Sw. bouppteckningssammanträde) held as a part of the bankruptcy
proceedings. However, financial instruments, currency and, under certain circumstances, gold, are exempt from
this requirement. The secured party may either sell such financial instruments, currency or gold immediately or
assume ownership (against reduction of the secured debt with the market value of such assets or, if the market
value of the assets exceeds the outstanding debt, against repayment to the debtor of the surplus), provided that
the realization is done in a commercially viable manner. Should the security granted consist of rights over
unlisted shares in a subsidiary of the debtor, the receiver in bankruptcy must still be given an opportunity to
redeem the shares prior to the sale or deduction.

###### Priority of Certain Creditors

In general, proceeds are distributed in the following order:

(a) fees to the receiver;

(b) debts of the estate (Sw. massaskuld);

(c) specific preferential rights;

(d) general preferential rights;

(e) non-prioritized debts; and

(f) subordinated debts.

Fixed charges (in specified assets) are generally prioritized in order of establishment and fixed charges are
generally prioritized to floating charges. Debts with the same priority will be paid in relation to relative size.

###### Limitations on the Value of a Guarantee and security interests

A Swedish limited liability company may not provide a guarantee for the obligations of a parent or sister
company, unless they belong to the same group of companies and the Parent of that group is domiciled within
the European Economic Area (EEA). Furthermore, if a Swedish limited liability company provides any
guarantee without receiving sufficient corporate benefit in return, such guarantee will, in whole or in part, be
considered a distribution of assets, which will be lawful only to the extent (i) there is sufficient coverage for the
unrestricted equity capital of the Swedish limited liability company after the distribution (in other words, at the
time the guarantee is provided) (where the aggregate amount available for distribution during the period from
the annual general meeting until the following year’s annual general meeting shall be calculated on the basis of
the balance sheet approved by the shareholders at the first annual general meeting, taking into account changes
in the restricted equity capital after such annual general meeting) and (ii) if it is considered prudent by a Swedish
Obligor to undertake the value transfer after having taken into consideration the equity requirements imposed
by the nature, scope and risks relating to its business or such Swedish Obligor’s need to strengthen its balance
sheet, liquidity or financial position. Where the Swedish limited liability company is a parent company, the
latter assessment is also made on a group level. It should also be noted that laws relating to financial assistance
in Sweden prohibit limited liability companies incorporated in Sweden from providing guarantees or other
credit support for obligations of any person where such obligations are being incurred for the purpose of

3


-----

acquiring shares in the company itself or any of its group companies (with the exception of its subsidiaries) or
refinancing shareholder loans in connection therewith. The guarantees of and security interests granted by a
Swedish Obligor are limited in accordance with the above restrictions relating to corporate benefit and are
subject to limitation language limiting the liability of such entities thereunder if required by the above
restrictions relating to financial assistance and in accordance with the above restrictions relating to corporate
benefit.

###### Limitations on the Validity of Certain Transactions

In bankruptcy and company reorganization proceedings, transactions can (in certain circumstances and subject
to a time limit) be reversed and the goods or money can then be returned to the bankruptcy estate or the company
subject to company reorganization. Broadly, these transactions include, among others, situations where the
debtor has conveyed property fraudulently or preferentially to one creditor to the detriment of its other creditors
before the initiation of the relevant insolvency proceedings, granting a Guarantee that was either not stipulated
at the time when the obligation arose or not perfected without delay after such time and the delay is not
considered to be ordinary, or paid a debt that is not due or that is considerable compared to the value of the
debtor’s assets or if the payment is made by using unusual means of payment. In the majority of situations, a
claim for recovery can be made concerning actions that were made during the three months preceding the
commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. In certain situations, longer time limits apply and in
others there are no time limits. These include, among others, situations where the other party to an agreement
or other arrangement is deemed to be a closely related party to the debtor such as a subsidiary or Parent.

###### Limitations on Enforceability due to the Swedish Reorganization Act

The Swedish Reorganization Act (Sw. lagen (2022:964) om företagsrekonstruktion) provides companies facing
difficulties in meeting their payment obligations with an opportunity to resolve these without being declared
bankrupt. A petition for company reorganization may be presented by (i) the debtor or (ii) a creditor of the
debtor. A petition for company reorganization submitted by a creditor may be granted only where the debtor
has consented to the petition. Corporate reorganization proceedings shall, as a main rule, terminate within three
months from commencement. The company may request an extension for three months at a time. A corporate
reorganization may not, however, proceed for an aggregate period exceeding twelve months, unless the court
has ordered plan negotiation prior thereto. In such case, the corporate reorganization shall terminate not later
than fifteen months after the order regarding corporate reorganization.

An administrator (Sw. rekonstruktör) is appointed by the court and supervises the day-to-day activities and
safeguards the interests of creditors as well as the debtor. However, the debtor remains in full possession of the
business except that, for important decisions such as paying a debt that has fallen due prior to the order of
reorganization, granting security for a debt that arose prior to the order, undertaking new obligations or
transferring, pledging or granting rights in respect of assets of a substantial value for the business, the consent
of the administrator is required. The absence of such consent can affect the validity of the transaction and the
administrator may request that the transaction be reversed.

Upon the opening of corporate reorganization proceedings, the administrator must notify the creditors of the
reorganization proceedings. A creditors’ meeting will be held at which the creditors will be given the opportunity
to express their opinions as to whether the reorganization should continue. Upon the request of any of the
creditors, the court shall appoint a creditors’ committee composed of a maximum of three persons. However,
where special cause exists, the court may appoint additional persons to serve on the creditors’ committee. The
administrator shall, if possible, consult with the creditors’ committee prior to taking any important decisions.

The making of an order under the Swedish Reorganization Act does not have the effect of terminating contracts
with the debtor (other than long-term contracts which the debtor may terminate with the consent of the
administrator) and, during the reorganization procedure, the debtor’s business activities continue in the ordinary

3 6


-----

course of business. However, the procedure includes a suspension of payments to creditors and the debtor cannot
pay a debt that fell due prior to the order without the consent of the administrator and such consent may only
be granted should there be exceptional reasons for doing so and any petition for bankruptcy in respect of the
debtor will be stayed. The debtor may decide that a contract entered into prior to the order shall be performed
with the consent of the administrator (however, the consent of the administrator is not required where the
contract is in the course of the day-to-day management of the business). Where the contract relates to ongoing
or divisible obligations, the debtor may under certain circumstances decide that the contract shall be performed
only for a certain period of time or only for a number of the obligations that remain to be performed. A
moratorium also applies to execution in respect of a claim or enforcement of security during corporate
reorganization proceedings. However, execution may take place in respect of a claim for which the creditor
holds a chattel mortgage or right or retention (which is the case with a Swedish law pledge over the shares in a
Swedish limited liability company where the share certificates of such company has been delivered to the agent)
with the consent of the administrator, where it is unlikely that the company restructuring will thereby be
jeopardized or where the impact on the creditor would otherwise be unreasonably burdensome. The absence of
such consent from the administrator affects the validity of the transaction.

The debtor may request that the court order negotiation regarding a restructuring plan (Sw. rekonstruktionsplan)
which contains the measures that are necessary to successfully address the debtor’s financial difficulties and to
ensure that the business can be continued, in whole or in part, by the debtor or by a third party. The administrator
may request that the court order plan negotiation where the debtor’s request for plan negotiations does not lead
to a restructuring plan being confirmed. The affected parties are divided into one or more classes based on their
position or interest (classes include, among others, creditors with specific preferential rights, non-prioritized
debts, subordinated debt and shareholders and other parties who have an ownership interest in the debtor or the
debtor’s business) whereby the restructuring plan is adopted by a vote and confirmed by the court, after which
the plan becomes binding on the debtor and the other parties concerned. The adoption of a restructuring plan
requires at least two-third majority within each class in respect of the number of voters and the amounts of
claims or rights. However, the court shall nevertheless confirm a restructuring plan under certain circumstances
even if it has not been approved by all classes (such as an inter-class cramdown whereby more than half of the
classes have approved the restructuring plan and at least one of these classes is comprised of creditors with
preferential rights and at least two of the classes who approved the restructuring plan is comprised of creditors
who can be expected to receive payment in the event of the debtor’s bankruptcy).

###### Effect of Bankruptcy on the Bankruptcy Debtor’s Contracts

The declaration of bankruptcy does not automatically terminate existing contracts and instead the receiver may
in its discretion choose to have the bankruptcy estate itself become party to any such existing contracts. If the
estate enters into the contract and performance by the creditor is due, the creditor may demand that the estate
performs its obligations as well or, if a grace period has been granted, request that the estate, without
unreasonable delay, provides acceptable security for its performance. If performance by the creditor is not due,
the creditor may request security where this is necessary in order to protect against loss. If the estate does not
enter into the contract within a reasonable time after the creditor’s demand or if it does not comply with the
creditor’s request to provide security, the creditor may terminate the contract.

###### Limitations due to capital deficiency

Pursuant to the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. aktiebolagslag (2005:551)), as amended (the “Swedish
Companies Act”), whenever a company’s board of directors has a reason to assume that, as a result of losses or
reductions in the value of the company’s assets or any other event, the company’s equity is less than half the
registered share capital, the company’s board of directors shall prepare a special balance sheet (Sw.
_kontrollbalansräkning) and have the auditors examine it. The same obligation arises if the company in_

3


-----

connection with enforcement pursuant to Chapter 4 of the Swedish Enforcement Code (Sw. utsökningsbalken
_(1981:774)) is found to lack sizeable assets._

If the special balance sheet presented at the initial shareholders’ meeting fails to show that, on the date of such
meeting, the equity of the company amounts to the registered share capital and the initial shareholders’ meeting
has not resolved that the company shall go into liquidation, the shareholders’ meeting shall, within eight months
of the initial shareholders’ meeting, reconsider the issue of whether the company shall go into liquidation
(second shareholders’ meeting). However, if the company undergoes company restructuring during the eightmonth time period, a second shareholders’ meeting need not be held earlier than two months after the
restructuring terminated. Prior to the second shareholders’ meeting, the board of directors shall prepare a new
special balance sheet and cause such to be reviewed by the company’s auditors. The new special balance sheet
and an auditor’s report thereon shall be presented at the second shareholders’ meeting.

If the special balance sheet presented at the initial shareholders’ meeting fails to show that, on the date of such
meeting, the equity of the company amounts to the registered share capital and the initial shareholders’ meeting
has not resolved that the company shall go into liquidation, the shareholders’ meeting shall, within eight month
of the initial shareholders’ meeting, reconsider the issue of whether the company shall go into liquidation
(second shareholders’ meeting). Prior to the second shareholders’ meeting, the board of directors shall prepare
a new special balance sheet and cause such to be reviewed by the company’s auditors. The new special balance
sheet and an auditor’s report thereon shall be presented at the second shareholders’ meeting.

A shareholders’ resolution on liquidation of the company shall be registered with the Swedish Companies
Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket), which shall appoint a liquidator. Should the shareholders not resolve on
such voluntary liquidation where required (which is where (i) a second shareholders’ meeting is not held within
the period of time stated above, or (ii) the new special balance sheet which was presented at the second
shareholders’ meeting was not reviewed by the company’s auditor or fails to show that, on the date of such
meeting, the equity of the company amounts to at least the registered share capital), the court may put the
company into compulsory liquidation and appoint a liquidator. The liquidator takes over management and
control of the company and shall sell the company’s assets and settle the company’s debts with the proceeds.
The liquidator shall give notice to the company’s unknown creditors and creditors that have not lodged their
claims with the liquidator within six months following such notice will have forfeited their rights to their claims.

###### Foreign Currency

Swedish courts may award judgments in currencies other than Swedish kronor, but the judgment debtor has the
right to pay the judgment debt, even though denominated in a foreign currency, in Swedish kronor at the rate
of exchange prevailing at the date of payment.

###### Norway

 Limitations on Guarantees and security interests

The obligations of a Guarantor incorporated in Norway (each a “Norwegian Obligor”) under a Guarantee or in
connection with any security interest provided under any security documents, will be limited by such mandatory
provisions of law applicable to that Norwegian Obligor limiting the legal capacity or ability of the Norwegian
Obligor to grant or honor its guarantee and/or security obligations as provided for in this offering memorandum,
including, but not limited to, the provisions of Sections 8-7 and 8-10 of the Norwegian Private Limited Liability
Companies Acts of 13 June 1997 no. 44 (No. aksjeloven) and the Norwegian Public Limited Liability
Companies Acts of 13 June 1997 no. 45 (No. allmennaksjeloven) (together, the “Norwegian Companies Acts”).

Section 8-7 of the Norwegian Companies Acts restricts a Norwegian limited liability company from granting
credit to, guaranteeing or providing security for the obligations of, its (direct and indirect) shareholders (or any

3 8


-----

affiliates of its shareholders) beyond its distributable reserves (free equity) and furthermore, it may only provide
such assistance if adequate security is provided in favor of the company’s repayment/recourse claim against
that shareholder or affiliate. Whether the granting of credit, guarantee or security is in compliance with the
Norwegian Companies Acts has to be determined at the time such credit, guarantee or security is provided.

The above restrictions in Section 8-7 of the Norwegian Companies Acts are, however, subject to certain
exceptions and the restrictions do not apply to any credit, guarantee or security provided for the obligations of
(i) its direct or indirect Norwegian parent company and its Norwegian and foreign subsidiaries, provided that
the parent company is a Norwegian limited liability company (No. morselskap) or (ii) its direct or indirect
foreign parent company and its subsidiaries, provided that the parent company has decisive influence over the
Norwegian company (typically meaning it owns more than 50 per cent. of the shares in the Norwegian
company) and provided that the credit, guarantee or security has been made in the “financial interest of the
group. It is somewhat uncertain how this term shall be interpreted, however, the general perception in Norway
seems to be that the term “the group’s financial interests” covers quite a wide range of transactions, but that for
instance transactions whose sole purpose is to benefit the shareholders of the company and not the group (such
as dividend recap-transactions and the like), will not be covered by this exception. Pursuant to the preparatory
works of the Norwegian Companies Acts, this condition will not be satisfied if funds from a Norwegian Obligor
are being utilized solely to the benefit of the group’s ultimate shareholders (for example, financing distributions
to the owners).

In addition to the restrictions with respect to upstream and cross-stream loans, guarantees and security outlined
above, Section 8-10 of the Norwegian Companies Acts restricts a Norwegian limited liability company from
granting any financial assistance (in other words, making assets available, granting credit or providing
guarantees or security) in connection with the acquisition of shares in itself or its direct or indirect parent
company, and these restrictions apply irrespective of whether the company whose shares are being acquired is
a Norwegian or a foreign company. In order for such financial assistance to be valid and binding, the financial
exposure of the Norwegian company providing financial assistance cannot exceed the distributable reserves
(free equity) of the company, and the financial assistance must also be granted according to “ordinary
commercial terms and principles.”

Following certain amendments to the Norwegian Companies Acts that came into force January 1, 2020, the
restriction limiting the financial assistance to the Norwegian company’s free equity does not apply if (i) the
acquirer of the shares is domiciled in the European Economic Area, (ii) the Norwegian company is, or will
following the acquisition, form part of the same group as the acquirer (in other words, be controlled by the
acquirer following the acquisition), (iii) the financial assistance is granted on customary commercial terms and
principles and (iv) certain "whitewash" procedures are complied with prior to the granting of such financial
assistance.

With respect to the aforementioned whitewash procedures, Section 8-10 provides that for a Norwegian company
to grant financial assistance in connection with an acquisition of shares in itself or its (direct or indirect) parent
company, its board of directors must issue a report (Nw. redegjørelse) where it makes an assessment of the
creditworthiness of the beneficiary of the financial assistance and also gives an account of the background and
the terms of the financial assistance in question. The board report must also include a declaration to the effect
that (1) it will be in the interest of the company to grant the financial assistance, and (2) that the company will
have sufficient equity and liquidity as required by the Norwegian Companies Acts when taking the financial
assistance into account. Further, the report must address the requirement of the financial assistance being
granted on ordinary commercial terms, typically by way of the target company receiving some kind of
consideration for providing the financial support (for example, guarantee commission or similar from the
acquirer). The board's decision to provide the financial assistance must thereafter be approved by a majority
representing at least two-thirds of both the votes and share capital represented at the general meeting of

3 9


-----

shareholders of the Norwegian company. Finally, the board report and statement by the board must be filed with
the Norwegian Business Register (Nw. Foretaksregisteret) before the financial assistance can be provided.

The Norwegian Companies Acts restricts financial assistance made “in connection with” the acquisition of
shares, which may also cover financial assistance after completion of the acquisition (such as the refinancing
of acquisition debt or the subsequent merger of the target company and the acquiring entity). There must,
however, be sufficient connection both in time and as regards other circumstances surrounding such assistance
for it to be in contravention of Section 8-10.

Section 8-10 explicitly states that the restrictions on financial assistance do not apply to distributions made in
accordance with the other provisions of the Norwegian Companies Acts, such as distributions by way of
dividends, group contributions or share capital reductions.

The issue of corporate benefit may in some situations impose a restriction on a Norwegian limited liability
company’s possibility to offer a guarantee and/or provide security to shareholders in addition to the restrictions
described above. Norwegian law does not have a “clear and well-defined” corporate benefit principle (stating
that transactions that do not sufficiently coincide with the interest or are to the benefit of the company may be
challenged), as you find in many other jurisdictions. Having said that, there are several provisions in the
Norwegian Companies Acts, whose main purpose are to ensure that shareholders and other related parties, board
members, creditors etc., do not get what may be considered an unreasonable benefit at the expense of the
Norwegian company (normally referred to as “abuse of lawful authority”) and/or secure maximum
profits/return for the company and its shareholders.

Financial assistance, guarantees or security infringing the limitations set out in Sections 8-7 and Section 8-10
of the Norwegian Companies Acts may be declared void if challenged and may give rise to directors’ liability
issues. If a credit, guarantee or security is provided in contravention of these rules, any funds paid out will have
to be repaid to the company. Typically, the financial assistance restrictions set out in Sections 8-7 and 8-10 are
dealt with by including so-called “limitation language” in the relevant finance documents (to the effect that the
Norwegian limited liability company only guarantees and secures the relevant obligations to the extent the same
would not be in breach of those restrictions).

###### Creation and enforcement of security

Norwegian law strictly requires written statutory basis for establishing a security interest. Although it is not
possible for a Norwegian company to provide a fixed or floating charge over all its present and future assets,
Norwegian law provides for effectively creating security over a range of closely defined asset types. For
example, floating charges may be established over certain asset types of a Norwegian company.

As a main rule, a secured creditor does not have a general step-in right to security assets in an enforcement
situation and agreements on enforcement cannot validly be entered into prior to the occurrence of an event of
default. Instead, enforcement must be sought through the Norwegian courts and/or the Norwegian enforcement
authorities. However, this is different for financial instruments, such as shares in a Norwegian limited liability
company. If the secured party is a financial institution or bond trustee, the shares are considered financial
collateral, and the parties are free (within reasonable limits) to agree on the enforcement process in the share
pledge agreement.

Also, for specific security assets, and under certain circumstances, a creditor may take possession or directly
enforce its rights upon enforcement. This is the case for security established over receivables (such as trade
receivables or bank account claims) whereby the secured party may instruct the relevant debtor to pay the
outstanding amounts directly to the secured party instead of to the chargor.

The concept of a security trustee, as it is understood under common law, does not exist under Norwegian law.
In practice, in an arrangement with a security agent acting on behalf of the secured parties, as these exist from

380


-----

time to time, it is generally recognized under Norwegian law that the security agent will be able to enforce the
security on behalf of the secured parties and apply any proceeds to the secured parties. In order to commence
any legal action regarding a claim (for enforcement purposes or otherwise) against the debtor the security agent
may, however, be required to disclose to the court the identity of the creditors and have the creditors join in or
participate as claimants in the proceedings. It has been established by the Norwegian Supreme Court that a bond
trustee for an undisclosed number of bondholders can, based on the provisions in the bond agreement, take legal
action against the issuer on behalf of and in lieu of the bondholders and without having to disclose the identity
of the bondholders.

###### Insolvency—Bankruptcy

Norwegian insolvency legislation is contained in the Norwegian Bankruptcy Act of June 8, 1984 no. 58 (the
“Norwegian Bankruptcy Act”), which sets out the various procedures to be followed, and the Creditors
Recovery Act of June 8, 1984 no. 59 (the “Norwegian Recovery Act”) containing _inter alia_ provisions
regulating priority of claims and revocation of certain pre-liquidation transactions.

Norwegian insolvency legislation (save for the provisional Norwegian Reconstruction Act described below)
prioritize the timely recovery and realization of underlying assets, rather than the rescue of the company/debtor
as such, and generally follow internationally recognized standards with: (i) a seizure and subsequent disposal
of debtor’s assets, (ii) assessment and ranking of claims, (iii) testing and revocation of transactions made prior
to bankruptcy, and (iv) continued operation of the company at the risk of, and (in practice) only if guaranteed
by, creditors.

Norwegian bankruptcy proceedings are opened following a petition from a creditor or the debtor itself to the
local court where the debtor has its headquarters. The court will request a cash deposit of NOK 63,850 (as of
2024) from the petitioning creditor (does not apply to the debtor or employee-initiated bankruptcy) to secure
court fees and basic costs related to the proceedings.

The court reviews whether the procedural and material requirements for opening the procedures are fulfilled. A
petition from a creditor will be served on the debtor, and a court hearing will take place usually within two or
three weeks after the petition has been filed with the court. The court will, pre-judicially, review any objections
the debtor might have to the petition (for example, whether the creditor holds a valid claim or the debtor’s
possible counterclaim, among others). Bankruptcy proceedings may only be opened if the debtor is deemed to
be insolvent.

There are two requirements for a debtor to be deemed to be insolvent. The debtor must (i) be unable to service
its debt as it becomes due, such payment difficulties not being of a temporary nature and (ii) the debtor must be
in deficit (the company’s debts must exceed the sum of its assets and revenue, based on real, not book, values).

The bankrupt company will be controlled by the court appointed liquidator (a lawyer). The liquidator is often
assisted and supervised by a creditors’ committee, also appointed by the court. A liquidator would be in control
of the company’s property following insolvency and the liquidator will generally adhere to the wishes of the
secured creditor as the liquidator’s main purpose is to dispose of the property.

The general task of the liquidator is to turn all assets into cash in the manner assumed to be most profitable for
the estate (i.e. the creditors) and then distribute the available cash to the creditors. All the company’s assets will
in practice be seized and the debtor may not dispose of the seized assets in any way while the bankruptcy
proceedings are ongoing.

The liquidator can decide that the business will continue to trade only if this is regarded as being in the best
interest of the estate as such. New debt incurred by the estate will be regarded as preferential debts. The
liquidator will therefore normally seek to obtain guarantees from creditors in favor of the estate (to cover debts
to suppliers, etc.).

381


-----

Secured creditors are, in principle, not deemed to be part of the bankruptcy proceedings to the extent the value
of the security is sufficient to cover the underlying obligations of the debtor. The secured creditors may, in
principle, realize the security, and cover their claims, however, keeping in mind that the realization of a number
of categories of security during the first six months after the opening of a bankruptcy will be subject to the
approval of the bankruptcy estate (the same principles apply to official debt negotiations). The bankruptcy estate
has the right, subject to certain conditions being fulfilled, to realize the security with a wiping out effect on
unmet liens and divide the proceeds between the secured creditors and others holding legal rights in the assets.

Furthermore, the bankruptcy estate has a statutory first lien of up to 5 per cent. of the estimated value or sales
value of all assets (except financial collateral) owned by the debtor for its own debt.

In Norwegian bankruptcies, the creditors will be paid according to the following priority:

(i) secured claims (are covered to the extent of the value of the secured asset; any remaining balance is
“transferred” to “ordinary claims”);

(ii) claims which arise during the bankruptcy proceedings, liquidators’ costs, obligations of the estate;

(iii) salary claims (within certain limitations);

(iv) tax claims (for example, withholding tax and VAT within certain limitations);

(v) ordinary claims (pari passu: unsecured debt, trade creditors, indemnity claims etc.); and

(vi) subordinated debt.

Pursuant to the Norwegian Recovery Act, the bankruptcy estate may be entitled to set aside or reverse
transactions carried out in the three to twelve-month period (and, in respect of transactions in favor of related
parties, up to two years) before the opening of the bankruptcy, such as extraordinary payments of certain
creditors, security established for existing debt and transactions at an under-value. The bankruptcy estate may
also, under certain circumstances, be entitled to set aside or reverse transactions made in bad faith or negligently
which in an improper manner increase the debtor’s debt, favor one or more creditors at the expense of others or
deprive the debtor of assets which may otherwise have served to cover the creditors’ claims, in which case the
time limit for challenges by the estate is increased to 10 years.

###### Insolvency—Reconstruction

The provisional Norwegian Provisional Reconstruction Act of May 7, 2020 No. 38 (the “Norwegian
Reconstruction Act”) relates to restructuring to alleviate financial difficulties resulting from the COVID-19
outbreak. Reconstruction is a law regulated “instrument” by which the debtor may seek bankruptcy protection
and protection from debt recovery proceedings, with the aim to reorganize the business and reach a composition
agreement with the creditors. The reconstruction proceedings are regulated by the Norwegian Reconstruction
Act, replacing, subject to certain exceptions, Part I of the Norwegian Bankruptcy Act for as long as the
Reconstruction Act remains in effect. The Norwegian Reconstruction Act will be in effect until 1 July 2025,
when it is contemplated that it will be replaced by a permanent reconstruction act.

Reconstruction proceedings may be initiated by the courts after petition from the debtor or, on certain
conditions, from creditors (but may not be instituted against the will of the debtor).

In order for the courts to open reconstruction proceedings, the debtor must be encountering, or will in the
foreseeable future encounter, severe financial difficulties.

If the petition is granted, the Court shall appoint a reconstructor (who shall be an insolvency lawyer) and a
creditors committee (the “Reconstruction Committee”).

The key feature of the reconstruction proceedings is that all creditor collection steps are suspended, in particular:

382


-----

- Payment of all pre-petition debt is suspended

- The debtor is protected from creditor initiated bankruptcy and debt recovery and enforcement
proceedings (except for financial collateral) while the debtor’s business is being reconstructed

- The debtor’s business is under the supervision of the Reconstruction Committee

The aim of the proceedings is in essence a reconstruction of the debtor’s business and to reduce the risk of
unnecessary bankruptcy of viable businesses.

The Reconstruction Act distinguishes between voluntary composition and compulsory composition. A
voluntary composition may in principle include any possible arrangement or composition. However, it requires
an approval from each and every one of the creditors, and is only binding on those creditors who have
participated in the composition (for example, not on “unknown” creditors). In a compulsory reconstruction,
there are limitations with respect to the contents of the proposal. It is however binding on the minority of
creditors, and also on unknown creditors.

Pursuant to the Reconstruction Act a voluntarily reconstruction may include (and a compulsory composition
can only include) a:

(i) Moratorium (i.e. extension of maturity/payment holiday);

(ii) percentage reduction of the debt (payment of a cash dividend as full/partial settlement);

(iii) full or partial conversion of debt to equity (generally only applicable to consenting creditors);

(iv) transfer of all or parts of the debtor’s business and assets, without liquidation;

(v) transfer and liquidation of all or parts of the debtor’s business and assets, discharging the debtor of the
obligations not covered by the liquidation; or

(vi) a combination of the above mentioned measures.

The proposed composition, together with the recommendation from the Reconstruction Committee, is
distributed to all creditors included in the composition, and the creditors are requested to confirm to the
Reconstruction Committee whether or not the proposed composition is accepted.

The creditors must accept or reject the composition within a time limit of minimum two, and maximum three
weeks.

The voluntary composition is considered approved when it has been accepted by all the creditors included in

the composition. A compulsory composition is considered approved when it has been accepted by [1]⁄2 of the
voting creditors (in value).

If the proposed composition is rejected by any of the creditors, the proposal may be subject to negotiations and
amended. The new proposal may be distributed to the creditors, always provided that the Reconstruction
Committee considers that the amended debt composition is likely to be obtained. If the amended proposal is
rejected, no further proposals may be distributed.

The only claims which may be excluded from the debt composition are preferential claims (salary and tax
deduction claims), secured claims, valid counterclaims, and claims below a defined threshold set out in the
proposed composition.

###### Solvent enforcement

Enforcement of security normally requires that the secured party files an application to the enforcement
authorities for the enforcement of the security. Certain types of security may, however, be enforced without the

383


-----

involvement of the enforcement authority or a court, typically security established pursuant to the Financial
Collateral Act of March 26, 2004 no. 17 and charges over monetary claims. A provision granting the secured
party such right of enforcement is typically included in any security agreement between the pledgor/chargor
and the secured party.

Enforcement of a guarantee claim against a solvent guarantor will in principal require a final, legally binding
judgment by a court (unless the guarantee is made as an enforceable promissory note). Thereafter the creditor
may apply to the enforcement authorities for enforcement of his or her claim.

###### Finland

 Applicable Insolvency Law

In the event of threatening or actual insolvency of a Finnish company, insolvency proceedings may be initiated
in Finland. Our Finnish guarantors are incorporated and have their center of main interests in Finland. According
to regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council on Insolvency Proceedings (recast)
(“Insolvency Regulation”), main insolvency proceedings involving a Finnish company and their effects would,
as a main rule, be governed by Finnish law. In case insolvency proceedings are connected to another EU member
state within the meaning of the Insolvency Regulation, and provided that said regulation is applied to such EU
member state, the provisions of the Insolvency Regulation shall apply.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the Finnish insolvency law.

The provisions of the Finnish Bankruptcy Act (FI: Konkurssilaki, 120/2004, as amended, “Bankruptcy Act”),
the Finnish Restructuring of Enterprises Act (FI: Laki yrityksen saneerauksesta, 47/1993, as amended,
“Restructuring Act”) and the Finnish Act on the Recovery of Assets to the Bankruptcy Estate (FI: Laki
takaisinsaannista konkurssipesään 758/1991, as amended, “Recovery Act”) are particularly relevant to this
discussion.

Under Finnish law, if there is an imminent risk of a company becoming insolvent or the company is already
insolvent but it is probable that a company restructuring would remedy the company’s insolvency, the company
may be placed in a company restructuring (FI: _yrityssaneeraus). There are two types of restructuring_
proceedings stipulated in the Restructuring Act: 1) early (preventive) restructuring (FI: varhaissaneeraus) and
2) regular restructuring (FI: perusmuotoinen saneeraus). Alternatively, if a company is insolvent, the company
may be subjected to bankruptcy proceedings (FI: konkurssi).

In addition to company restructuring and bankruptcy, a Finnish limited liability company may also be subject
to liquidation (FI: selvitystila) under the Finnish Companies Act (FI: Osakeyhtiölaki, 624/2006, as amended).
However, liquidation proceedings are voluntary and are used in practice to dissolve a solvent company. In cases
where a solvent company is subject to liquidation, there is an obligation for the liquidator to conclude liquidation
proceedings and file for bankruptcy if it later turns out that the company’s known debts cannot be fully settled
in liquidation. Thus, considerations regarding liquidation proceedings are not addressed in the following.

###### Company Restructuring

An application for early or regular company restructuring can be filed with a court by the debtor. An application
for regular restructuring can also be filed by one or more creditors.

If the company is in a state of imminent insolvency (i.e. otherwise than only temporarily unable to pay debts
when due), it may file for early restructuring. Filing for early restructuring is not possible if state of insolvency
has already been reached.

A debtor (or creditor) may file for regular restructuring on the basis of insolvency if it is probable that company
restructuring would remedy the insolvency or prevent its recurrence otherwise than temporarily., The initiation

384


-----

of regular restructuring proceedings is also possible without analysis of the debtor company’s solvency
situation, when at least two creditors not related to the debtor whose total claims represent at least one-fifth of
the debtor’s known debts file a joint application with the debtor or declare that they support the debtor’s
application for regular restructuring.

If there are no specific barriers to restructuring under the Restructuring Act and, consequently, the court
approves the application and commences restructuring proceedings, the court will simultaneously appoint a
restructuring administrator (FI: selvittäjä). The purpose of restructuring proceedings is to investigate whether
the debtor’s business has a reasonable chance to continue profitably and, if so, to rehabilitate the company’s
viable business, ensure its continued viability, make debt arrangements and execute other restructuring
measures. The Board of Directors and the Managing Director continue to act on behalf of the company during
the restructuring proceedings. The restructuring administrator’s right to receive information of the debtor
company’s business is extensive. The administrator is entitled to review the debtor company’s books and
business documents and obtain any information on the company’s business activities, as well as to participate
in meetings of the debtor’s corporate bodies such as board meetings. The restructuring administrator’s consent
is required for certain legal acts of a significant nature of the debtor company specified in the Restructuring
Act.

As a general rule, the commencement of restructuring proceedings has no effect on the debtor’s existing
contracts. However, there are some exceptions set forth in the Restructuring Act regarding premature
termination of certain contracts, such as lease agreements, unfulfilled contracts not deemed to be a regular part
of the activities of the debtor and employment relationships. As of June 1, 2023 the termination right will expand
even to indefinite and fixed-term contracts in which the debtor is committed to repeated and/or continuous nonmonetary performance.

###### Moratorium

In early restructuring, the court will decide upon a moratorium when deciding on the respective application for
early restructuring. A moratorium is imposed if the application is approved, and the court deems that it is not
likely that such an order is unnecessary e.g. based on creditors’ views on low expectations of a successful
restructuring.

In regular restructuring, all existing claims against the debtor company that have arisen before the filing of the
restructuring application (“restructuring debt”) are suspended as of the commencement of the company
restructuring.

As a main rule, moratorium results in several interdictions regarding restructuring debts including a prohibition
over:

1. repayment and placement of security,

2. debt collection measures including enforcement of security provided by the debtor,

3. enforcement measures through the enforcement authority, and

4. precautionary measures, such as seizure of assets.

At the request of the applicant the court may order in both early and regular restructuring that a moratorium is
in effect on an interim basis already prior to the commencement of restructuring proceedings (in other words,
shortly after the filing of the application for the restructuring proceedings).

In early restructuring, the moratorium is in force three months at a time and for a maximum of 12 months from
when the first order over (interim or actual) moratorium became in force. In regular restructuring, the

38


-----

moratorium is in force until the restructuring program has been affirmed by the court or the proceedings have
been, for reasons specified in the Restructuring Act, dismissed or interrupted.

By default, the moratorium does not prevent the collection of a restructuring debt from a guarantor, joint debtor
or from the value of a collateral provided by a third party, nor the giving of notice or otherwise terminating the
debt for the part of the guarantor or the provider of the collateral provided that the guarantee, joint debt or
collateral had been given in the context of business operations or other comparable activities.

Debts arising on the date when the restructuring application has been filed and thereafter are not, as a general
rule, considered restructuring debt, but new debt, and must be repaid as they become due. The same applies to
fees, charges and other running expenses (for example, lease payments) based on a continuous contractual
relationship or on a continuous contract regarding the use or possession of assets, to the extent as these relate
to the period subsequent to the filing of the application.

###### Debt Arrangements

Creditors with equal ranking receivables have an equal status in the arrangements of the restructuring debts
within the restructuring program.

Subject to certain restrictions set forth in the Restructuring Act, the following measures may be taken with
respect to unsecured restructuring debts: (i) changing the repayment schedule; (ii) ordering that debt payments
be considered as payments against principal first, and as payments of interest and other credit costs only after
the repayment of the principal; (iii) reducing the obligation to pay interest and other credit costs with respect to
the remaining term of a debt; and (iv) reducing the outstanding principal balance of unpaid debt. The
restructuring program may also include the full or partial refinancing of debt, either as a lump sum funded by
the issuance of new debt or with payments in lieu of performance that are considered reasonable having regard
to the creditor’s field of business and position.

Secured debt means restructuring debt where a creditor holds an effective (against third parties) security interest
over assets that belong to or are in the possession of the debtor, in so far as the value of the security at the
commencement of the proceedings would have been sufficient to cover the amount of the creditor’s claim after
the deduction of liquidation costs and claims with a higher priority. When the interdiction of restructuring debt
collection is in force, assets pledged by the debtor company as security cannot be liquidated by the pledge
holder during restructuring proceedings; instead, secured creditors’ receivables receive preferential treatment
based on the value of the security; most importantly their principal cannot be reduced (“cut”) in the restructuring
program up to the value of the security. The part of the creditor’s claim that is not covered by the value of the
security does not qualify as secured debt but, instead, is regarded as unsecured debt for the purposes of the
restructuring proceedings and may, thus be subject to the measures described above. Regarding business
mortgages, only 50 per cent of the value of the mortgaged assets will be considered as secured debt. The value
of the assets will be determined in the restructuring program.

The following debt arrangements may be applied to secured debt: (i) changing the repayment schedule; (ii)
ordering that debt payments be applied as payments against principal first and as payments of interest and other
credit costs second; or (iii) reducing the obligation to pay interest and other credit costs with respect to the
remaining term of the debt. The restructuring program may also include the full or partial refinancing of secured
debt as a lump sum payment funded by the issuance of new debt.

Even if the debt arrangement does not affect the existence or content of a creditor’s security interest, the security
arrangements relating to the debt may be altered by replacing the security with another fully adequate security.

Payments on a secured debt shall be set so that at least the present value of the secured debt will be repaid
within a reasonable period, which shall not materially exceed the remainder of the credit period without the
consent of the creditor or, if the debt has become due in full, materially exceed half of the original credit period.

386


-----

As for reducing interest and other credit costs, the length of the remaining credit period should be taken into
consideration in the restructuring program, so that the longer the remaining credit period, the smaller the
reduction in interest and credit costs.

###### Approval of the Restructuring Program

The restructuring program draft shall be drawn up by the restructuring administrator. Restructuring program
draft may also be prepared by the debtor and subject to certain prerequisites creditor(s). The court shall affirm
the program subject to the approval of all the known creditors or with the acceptance of a majority of the voting
creditors in creditor groups in accordance with the Restructuring Act. The creditors shall be divided into voting
groups as follows: (1) Secured creditors; (2) Creditors holding a floating charge as security for their claims; (3)
Unsecured creditors, (4) Unsecured creditors whose claims may be enforced without a judgment or court order
(such as tax receivables); and (5) Creditors with the lowest-priority claims. However, there are some specific
limitations under the Restructuring Act relating to the affirmation of the restructuring program which apply
even if the restructuring program is approved by all creditors or the majority in all groups of creditors.
Furthermore, even if the majority does not exist in one or several groups of creditors, the restructuring program
may nonetheless be approved at the request of the person who has prepared the draft program, the administrator
or the debtor, subject to the terms specified in the Restructuring Act (cross class cram down). In such a case the
restructuring claims of the creditors in favor of the program must represent at minimum one-fifth of all
restructuring claims of the debtor company taken into consideration in the voting procedure in accordance with
the Restructuring Act and at least one group of creditors must have voted for the approval of the program by
majority. There is also a possibility of affirmation on the restructuring program in expedited proceedings
(“Expedited Affirmation”) provided that the program is supported, in writing, by creditors whose claims total
at least 70 per cent of the overall total claims of the creditors, and from each creditor whose claim is at least 10
per cent of the overall total claims of the creditors.

Alternatively, Expedited Affirmation is available if the program is supported by creditors whose claims total at
least 60 per cent. of the overall total claims of the creditors, and by each creditor whose claim is at least 10 per
cent. of the overall total claims of the creditors if the debtor is obliged to settle at least 25 per cent. of each
creditor’s claim within one year from the affirmation of the program.

###### Bankruptcy

A debtor or a creditor as qualified in the Bankruptcy Act may apply for bankruptcy from a court of competent
jurisdiction when the debtor is unable to pay its debts when due and the inability to pay is not temporary (i.e.
the company is considered insolvent). If the application is approved, an estate administrator (or, exceptionally,
several estate administrators) (FI: pesänhoitaja) will be appointed by the court.

A bankruptcy covers all the liabilities of the debtor, and its objective is to liquidate the assets of the debtor and
use the proceeds received, deducted by expenses of the bankruptcy estate in payment of the bankruptcy
creditors’ claims. The bankruptcy estate may also (subject to the bankruptcy creditors’ decision) continue the
company’s business operations even if this is in practice rare. The debtor’s assets are, from the beginning of the
bankruptcy, subject to the authority of the creditors and estate administrator. The bankruptcy creditors are
represented through the creditors’ meeting. The estate administrator must act for the common benefit of all
bankruptcy creditors and shall comply with the decisions and guidelines of the bankruptcy creditors in matters
falling within the decision-making powers of the creditors.

###### Notices to the Bankruptcy Estate with regard to Claims

As a main rule, in order to be entitled to a disbursement (FI: jako-osuus), a creditor must lodge a claim in writing
with the estate administrator by the lodgment date set by the estate administrator (FI: _konkurssivalvonta)._
However, there are some specific exceptions in the Bankruptcy Act according to which a claim is to be taken
into account without it being filed.

38


-----

Information concerning the lodgment date shall be sent to the Legal Register Centre (FI: Oikeusrekisterikeskus),
the debtor and all known creditors. If there are a lot of unknown creditors or other reasons, the information can
also be published in the Official Journal of Finland (FI: Virallinen lehti).

The obligation to notify the bankruptcy estate of a claim is binding even on a creditor with a secured claim. A
creditor who holds assets belonging to the debtor as security for the debt of a third party must, at the request of,
and within a time limit set by the estate administrator, provide the same information on the receivables and
security as should be provided in a lodgment of claim. A creditor who holds a business mortgage over the assets
of the debtor, as referred to in the Finnish Business Mortgages Act (FI: _Yrityskiinnityslaki_ 634/1984, as
amended), as security for a claim against the debtor in bankruptcy or a debt owed by some other debtor shall
file the claim as provided in the Bankruptcy Act. If a claim is denominated in a currency other than euro, the
value in euro for the purposes of the bankruptcy proceedings is determined using the exchange rate of the date
of commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings.

A creditor who wishes to use his or her claim for set-off against a debt owed to the debtor must, when giving
notice of the set-off, provide the estate administrator with the same information that would be provided in a
lodgment of claim. The notice of set-off must be made at the latest on the lodgment date.

###### Disbursements

The estate administrator draws up a list of how the proceeds of the estate are to be divided among the creditors
(“draft disbursement list”, FI: _jakoluetteloehdotus). The court affirms that the estate administrator’s draft_
disbursement list meets the statutory requirements and that the procedural provisions relating to the draft
disbursement list have been observed. A creditor may make statements on the draft disbursement list in so far
as it concerns another creditor’s claim or its own lodgment of claim. A creditor may dispute the claim of another
creditor or its precedence of rank, as entered into the draft disbursement list. After having heard the creditors
and the debtor, the estate administrator will draw up a (final) disbursement list by revising the draft disbursement
list as he or she sees fit on the basis of the disputes and statements. The estate administrator’s disbursement list
shall be submitted to the court for affirmation.

According to the Finnish Act on the Order of Payment of Creditors (1578/1992, as amended, FI: Laki velkojien
_maksunsaantijärjestyksestä), the claims are satisfied in the following order of priority:_

(i) creditors of secured claims (excluding claims secured by business mortgage) and holders of retention
rights, with priority over the proceeds from the respective security asset;

(ii) creditors of the administrative expenses of the bankruptcy estate and claims on the basis of contracts that
the bankruptcy estate has assumed or entered into;

(iii) if the company has undergone early or regular restructuring proceedings before the bankruptcy, (A) fees
and expenses of the restructuring administrator with interest on delayed payments until the satisfaction
of the debt and (B) debts that have arisen between the commencement and discontinuation of
restructuring proceedings with interest on delayed payments until the satisfaction of the debt;

(iv) creditors with claims that are secured by a business mortgage will receive 50 per cent of the value of the
mortgaged assets; and

(v) unsecured creditors have an equal right to payment out of the proceeds of the bankruptcy estate in the
proportion of the amount of their claims. In case of secured claims and claims secured by business
mortgage, any debt exceeding the value of the assets pledged as collateral is considered unsecured debt,
unless these fall under another category of precedence.

Certain claims are settled after all other claims. In practice, the most significant of such claims is interest
accruing on bankruptcy debt after the commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings, a bond that pursuant to

388


-----

its terms ranks after all the other obligations of the issuer and a subordinated loan that in insolvency and
liquidation may be settled only after all the other claims. The Finnish state has no preferential rights regarding
taxes and other fiscal charges.

###### Enforcement of pledged property

The assets of the bankruptcy estate are to be liquidated (sold or otherwise disposed of) in the most advantageous
manner so as to maximize the aggregate net realization proceeds, for example by way of auctions, through
advertising and direct solicitation of potential buyers. However, creditors that are secured pursuant to a security
interest over movable or immovable property for their bankruptcy receivables may enforce such security
regardless of the bankruptcy proceedings. Such right is not available for creditors secured by business mortgage.

The estate administrator may at their own discretion prohibit the sale of pledged property for a maximum of
two months, but only once. The bankruptcy estate may sell secured assets belonging to the estate only if the
creditor to whom the assets have been pledged as security consents to the same or if the court grants a specific
permission. At the request of the bankruptcy estate, assets of the bankruptcy estate may also be sold in
accordance with the provisions of the Finnish Enforcement Code (705/2007, as amended, FI: Ulosottokaari,
“Enforcement Code”) if the bailiff consents to the same.

###### Recovery of Assets

Pursuant to the Finnish Recovery Act (758/1991, as amended, FI: _Laki takaisinsaannista konkurssipesään)_
certain acts carried out by a debtor can be revoked in bankruptcy if the rights of the creditors have been
prejudiced by or as a result of those acts. According to the Restructuring Act and the Enforcement Code, the
grounds for recovery set forth in the Recovery Act shall also be applied in company restructuring and
enforcement proceedings.

The estate administrator, the restructuring administrator, enforcement authority and certain creditors may seek
the recovery of assets of the debtor to the bankruptcy estate or the company under restructuring or enforcement
proceedings. The administrator or the creditors may, within a specified time, either file an action for recovery
in court against the debtor’s counterparty involved in the act or dispute a lodgment of claim filed in bankruptcy.
The period to file an action in both bankruptcy and restructuring proceedings is one year from the
commencement of the respective proceedings or three months from the moment that the bankruptcy estate or
restructuring administrator took note or should have taken note of the grounds for recovery.

Certain general rules for recovery apply to all transactions between an insolvent debtor (including a debtor who
becomes insolvent partially due to the transaction) and the debtor’s counterparty. A transaction concluded within
five years prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, company restructuring or enforcement was filed
may be recovered if:

(i) the transaction, either by itself or together with other transactions, improperly (a) favors a creditor at the
expense of other creditors, (b) places assets of the debtor beyond the reach of creditors, or (c) increases
debts to the detriment of creditors;

(ii) the debtor, at the time of the transaction, was, or partly due to the transaction became, insolvent, or overindebted in case of a transaction that can be considered a gift or a contract with the characteristics of a
gift;

(iii) the counterparty knew or should have known of the insolvency or over-indebtedness, or the relevance
of the transaction to the debtor’s economic situation; and

(iv) the counterparty knew or should have known of the facts mentioned above in item (i), on the basis of
which the transaction is considered improper.

389


-----

The grounds for recovery under Section 5 of the Recovery Act, which covers all transactions concluded between
the debtor and a counterparty, are thus applicable only if the counterparty had qualified or should have had
qualified knowledge of all the issues described above in items (i) and (ii). Transactions between the debtor and
certain (natural or legal) persons within the debtor’s sphere of interest (closely related parties, FI: läheiset, as
defined in the Recovery Act) may be recovered regardless of the date of the transaction and such persons are
assumed to have had knowledge of the issues described above in items (i) and (ii). Also, the burden of proof
with regard to above mentioned issues, is reversed if the transaction was concluded between such closely related
parties.

Pursuant to the Recovery Act, certain transactions can, in certain circumstances, be recovered regardless of the
good faith of the counterparty and regardless of the solvency of the debtor at the time of the transaction. Such
transactions include, among other things: (i) payments received through enforcement; (ii) the payment of debts;
and (iii) the granting of security or other collateral (and (iv) gifts or contracts with characteristics of a gift,
which shall not be discussed further herein).

Any debt paid later than three months prior to the date when the application for bankruptcy, company
restructuring, or enforcement was filed with the court or relevant authority may be recovered if: (i) unusual
means of payment have been used; (ii) the payment was premature; or (iii) the amount of payment was
considerable in comparison to the assets of the debtor. However, a payment may not be recovered if it, when
all circumstances are taken into consideration, may be considered ordinary. A debt paid to a natural or legal
closely related person may be recovered within a longer two-year period unless it is shown that the debtor, at
the time of the payment, was not insolvent or did not become insolvent due to the payment.

A security or other collateral given later than three months prior to the date when the application for bankruptcy,
company restructuring or enforcement was filed with the court or the relevant authority may be recovered if:
(i) the parties had not agreed upon the security in connection with the creation of the debt; or (ii) the possession
of the security had not been transferred or another act perfecting the security had not been completed without
unjustified delay after the creation of the debt. A security given to a natural or legal person considered as a
closely related party may be recovered within a longer two-year period unless it is shown that the debtor was
not insolvent or did not become insolvent due to the arrangements for security.

When a transaction is recovered, the assets that have been received from the debtor are returned to the debtor
or the bankruptcy estate if the debtor is in bankruptcy. The bankruptcy estate also returns the compensation that
potentially had been paid for the assets. If the compensation has been placed beyond the reach of the creditors
and the party that paid the compensation knew or should have known that this was the intention of the debtor,
there is no obligation to return the compensation. If the assets or compensation to be returned no longer exist,
or are otherwise not returnable, compensation for the value of the assets must be made. In addition, should the
return of certain assets cause inconvenience to the party under such obligation, a court may entitle such party
to pay compensation equal to the value of the assets instead of returning the assets. The Recovery Act also sets
forth an obligation to compensate for any decrease in value of the returnable assets.

###### Limitations on the validity and enforceability of guarantees and security

Pursuant to the provisions of the Finnish Companies Act (624/2006, as amended, FI: _Osakeyhtiölaki) (the_
“Finnish Companies Act”), a Finnish limited liability company may not provide financing for, or grant
guarantees or security to secure the financing of, the acquisition of its or its parent company’s shares (financial
assistance).

Further, a Finnish limited liability company can only distribute its assets in the ways specified in the Finnish
Companies Act. Other transactions that reduce the assets of a company or increase its liabilities without a
corporate benefit i.e., unless doing so is in the company’s own commercial interest, constitute an unlawful
distribution of assets. Granting of guarantees and security requires that the granting of guarantee/security is

390


-----

based on sound business reasons (corporate benefit). The business justification for granting the guarantee or
security is assessed on a company-level and on a stand-alone basis. Group benefit can only be taken into regard
in case the issuer of the guarantee or security can be reasonably argued to derive, as a member of the group, a
benefit itself as a result of the overall group benefit. In addition to the corporate benefit requirement, the granting
of the guarantee/security has to be within the limits of the company’s business purpose (as set out in its articles
of association), the company may not be insolvent, and the granting of security may not result in the company
becoming insolvent.

For the abovementioned reasons, it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees,
and security documents to include, where such security is granted for third party liabilities (including other
members of the group), language pursuant to which the scope of guarantees and security granted by limited
liability companies incorporated in Finland is contractually limited so as to not be in conflict with the relevant
statutory limitations. The actual scope of a guarantee issued or security granted by a Finnish obligor may
therefore be substantially less than the aggregate amount of liabilities expressed to be guaranteed or secured
and, in fact, it is possible that, owing to the application of mandatory Finnish law relating to unlawful profit
distribution, as applied to the guarantee or security granted, no liabilities or obligations will, under Finnish law,
be held to be effectively guaranteed or secured.

###### Creation of a valid security interest

The creation of a valid and enforceable security interest under Finnish law is achieved by pledging the security
assets and perfecting such pledge, typically by transferring such security assets into the exclusive physical
possession of the pledgee. In the event that the physical transfer of the security asset is not possible, the security
interest may, as a general rule, be perfected by way of notice to the relevant third-party debtor (such as the
issuer company in case of share pledge without share certificates, the account bank in case of the pledge of bank
accounts, and the pledgor’s debtor in case of receivables). In respect of certain specific asset classes (such as
real estate, qualifying vehicles, ships, aircraft, intellectual property rights, and shares in book-entry form), the
perfection of a security interest is achieved by way of registration. Furthermore, the relevant method of
perfection may comprise elements of all three different categories; in the case of a business mortgage, the
perfection requires both transfer of possession of a physical mortgage note and the registration thereof.

Such Finnish perfection requirements set forth that, in order for the security interest to be effective against third
parties, the security interest must be made publicly observable, and accordingly the pledgor must be effectively
deprived of its right to control, deal with, or dispose of the security assets through transfer of possession of the
security asset, notifying the relevant third party of the security interest (and, _inter alia, the redirection of_
payments to the pledgee) and/or, as applicable, registration. If the pledgor remains in possession of, retains
exclusive or shared control over, or remains entitled to operate or collect, invest and dispose of any income
from such assets, the relevant security interest will not be deemed to have been effectively created until it is
duly perfected, typically after the occurrence of the agreed trigger event. Perfection cannot be achieved once
insolvency proceedings have been commenced and can be deemed susceptible and be set aside in insolvency
proceedings if perfected within a certain critical time as explained above before the commencement of
insolvency proceedings. Notwithstanding the aforesaid, a business mortgage does not, at the cost of validity of
the security interest, prevent disposals and other use of the mortgaged property required in the ordinary course
of business for the exchange of goods or necessary replacement of property.

###### Enforcement of security

A secured creditor may primarily enforce its security interest and collect its claims by the means available under
applicable Finnish enforcement legislation. As an alternative to the statutory procedures, the parties are, in
general, free to agree on other methods of enforcement, such as the disposal of the property by means of a
voluntary sale. It is, however, mandatory in the light of general principles of Finnish law that the relevant debt

391


-----

has fallen due and that the pledgor has been given notice to the effect that the pledge object will be sold.
Regardless of the chosen method, the interests of the pledgor must, however, be reasonably considered. Finnish
law imposes a duty of loyalty on the pledgee to take into account the interests of the pledgor in the enforcement
to the extent this will not adversely affect the pledgee’s own rights.

The pledge of most movable assets (such as shares) may be enforced without a court judgment or the
involvement of an enforcement official or, should the pledgee deem it necessary, through official enforcement.
A pledge of shares is typically enforced by private sale and a pledge of receivables either by selling the
receivable or by the secured creditor collecting payment of the receivable. Typically, the collection of
receivables directly from the debtors of the pledgor results in a more expedient and profitable outcome than a
sale of the receivables, both of which are forms of self-enforcement. In case the debtor does not pay the debts
in the due time, the pledgee has the possibility to file a claim to the district court in order to obtain judgment by
default, which can be used as grounds for official enforcement.

The Finnish Commercial Code (3/1734, as amended, Kauppakaari) stipulates a default process in respect of an
enforcement of pledge of movable assets. The parties may, as a rule, contract out most parts of the default
process. The parties’ discretion with regard to the enforcement methods is, however, limited (a) by the statutory
invalidity of a contractual provision providing that title to the pledged asset shall, upon default, automatically
transfer to the pledgee (however, the debtor and creditor may, after the pledgee has become entitled to enforce
the security, effectively agree that an obligation is discharged partly or in full by the pledgee assuming
ownership of the pledged asset), and (b) by the pledgee always having a duty to ascertain that the interests of
the pledgor and other creditors of the pledgor are not unduly jeopardized due to the actions taken by the pledgee.

To enforce a business mortgage, the pledgee needs to have obtained a legally valid judgment outside formal
insolvency procedures; a business mortgage is not immediately enforceable if the pledgor refuses to pay or is
unable to pay in accordance with the agreed terms. In case of insolvency, a creditor holding a business mortgage
enjoys the right to receive payments once claims secured by other pledges or mortgages have been first satisfied
out of the relevant security assets, which claims also include claims that are by law directly recoverable from
the assets of the bankruptcy estate. Debts secured by a business mortgage are subject to such security interest
up to a maximum of 50 per cent of the value of the assets; any remaining amount not covered by the business
mortgage is treated as an unsecured debt to be satisfied with the same priority as regular unsecured debts. Under
the Finnish Bankruptcy Act, the creditors secured by a business mortgage must secure their claim in a
bankruptcy as ordinary unprivileged creditors and the enforcement of a business mortgage is not distinct from
the bankruptcy itself. If the pledgor is under restructuring pursuant to the Finnish Restructuring of Enterprises
Act, the creditor is in the position of an ordinary creditor of a restructuring debt.

###### SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES

 Sweden

Pursuant to the provisions of Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of
December 12, 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial
matters (hereinafter the “Recast Brussels Regulation,” which apply to proceedings instituted, and judgments
issued, from January 10, 2015), a judgment issued against a company in the courts of a member state of the
European Union (hereinafter a “Member State”) which is enforceable in that Member State, will be directly
enforceable in Sweden provided that the formal requirements in the Recast Brussels Regulation are satisfied.
An application for refusal of enforcement may be lodged with the competent Swedish district court. Where such
application is lodged the Swedish court may stay the proceedings if an ordinary appeal against the judgment
has been lodged in the Member State of origin or the time for such appeal has not yet expired.

Under the 2007 Lugano Convention on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil
and commercial matters (hereinafter the “Lugano Convention”), a judgment issued against a company in the
courts of a member state of the European Union or the European Free Trade Association (hereinafter a
“Contracting State”) which is enforceable in that Contracting State, will be enforceable in Sweden upon the
fulfilment of the following requirements: (a) that a motion for enforcement has been granted by the competent
Swedish district court, and (b) that the formal requirements in the Lugano Convention have been fulfilled.

Judgments issued against a Swedish party in the courts of a state which is not a Member State or a Contracting
State (hereinafter a “Third Country”) are, as a general rule, not legally recognized or enforceable in Sweden.
Instead, a Third Country judgment will be regarded by a Swedish court, administrative tribunal or executive or
other public authority merely as factual evidence of, for example, the outcome or circumstances of the dispute
to which the judgment relates. The United States is a Third Country. Thus, New York law, which is the governing
law of the Notes and the Indenture, falls into the foregoing category. Thus, separate legal proceedings on the
same subject matter must generally be commenced in Sweden. During those proceedings the Swedish court
will, as a general rule, not be bound by the outcome of the Third Country judgment and may choose to try the
dispute without regard to the Third Country judgment. Under certain conditions, including where a contract
under review contains an exclusive jurisdiction clause in favor of the Third Country courts, the Swedish court
will not re-examine the merits of the claim. Instead, the Swedish court in that case may render a judgment based
on the foreign judgment. However, it is nevertheless the Swedish, and not the Third Country, judgment that will
ultimately be enforced. Following the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union and the end of the
United Kingdom’s transition period, the United Kingdom is deemed a Third Country for the purposes of the
Recast Brussels Regulation and the Lugano Convention. However, judgments obtained from a court in the
United Kingdom in respect of an exclusive jurisdiction clause under a contract dated on, or after, January 1,
2021, may thereafter be enforced in accordance with, and subject to the fulfilment of the relevant conditions of,
the 2005 Hague Convention on choice of court agreements, to which the European Union is a contracting state
and the United Kingdom acceded effective from January 1, 2021. Consequently, judgments obtained from a
court in the United Kingdom and which either do not fulfil the foregoing requirements or which relate to a
contract dated prior to January 1, 2021, may not be enforced in accordance with the Hague Convention.

Foreign arbitral awards are enforceable in Sweden pursuant to the Swedish Arbitration Act which reflects the
rules of the New York Convention (to which Sweden has acceded).

Enforcement may also be subject to the effects of any applicable bankruptcy, reorganization or moratorium and
other similar mandatory laws affecting creditors’ rights generally.

###### Norway

Pursuant to the Norwegian Enforcement Act of June 26, 1992 No 86, a civil judgment/ruling or in-court
settlement (a “judgment”) against a Norwegian party passed by the courts of a foreign state may be recognized
and enforced in Norway if (i) this follows from Norwegian law or agreement with the foreign state in question,
or (ii) the jurisdiction of the foreign court has been specifically agreed between the parties in a particular civil
matter in accordance with the Norwegian Civil Procedure Act of June 17, 2005 No. 90 section 4-6. Pursuant to
the Norwegian Dispute Act of June 17, 2005 No. 90 section 4-8, the Lugano Convention on Jurisdiction and
the Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters applies as Norwegian law.
However, the Lugano Convention does not apply to (i) the status or legal capacity of natural persons, rights in
property arising out of a matrimonial relationship, wills and succession; (ii) bankruptcy, proceedings relating
to the winding up of insolvent companies or other legal persons, judicial arrangements, compositions and
analogous proceedings; (iii) social security; (iv) arbitration.

Furthermore, a judgment will only be recognized or enforced as a matter of right if it is (i) enforceable in and
pursuant to the laws of the country in which it has been passed, and (ii) the recognition and enforcement of the
judgment is not considered to be in conflict with public policy (“ordre public”).

The foregoing could imply, inter alia, that judgments by U.S. courts may not be recognized or enforced in
Norway as a matter of right, unless the parties have agreed to the jurisdiction of the U.S. court in question.
However, judgments that are not recognized or enforced may be admissible as evidence in the courts of law,
executive or other public authorities of Norway and may, assuming the same applicable law applies (lex causae),
in such capacity carry persuasive authority depending on the merits of the judgment limiting the need for a full
retrial on its merits.

Civil judgements rendered by the courts of the United Kingdom will be recognized and enforced in Norway
pursuant to the bilateral agreement with the United Kingdom dated October 13, 2020, declaring the continued
application of the bilateral convention between the United Kingdom and Norway providing reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil matters dated June 12, 1961.

Foreign arbitral awards are enforceable in Norway pursuant to the Norwegian Arbitration Act of 14 May, 2004
No 25 section 45 and 46 which reflects the rules of the New York Convention (to which Norway has acceded).

###### Finland

Pursuant to the provisions of the Recast Brussels Regulation, which apply to proceedings instituted, and
judgments issued, from January 10, 2015, a judgment issued in the courts of a Member State which is
enforceable in that Member State, will be directly enforceable in Finland in accordance with the provisions of
the Regulation, provided that the formal requirements in the Regulation are satisfied.

Under the 2007 Lugano Convention on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil
and commercial matters, a judgment issued in the courts of Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, or a member state of
the European Union, which is enforceable in that contracting state, will be enforceable in Finland upon the
fulfilment of the following requirements: (a) a motion for enforcement has been granted by the competent
Finnish district court, and (b) the formal requirements set out in the Lugano Convention have been fulfilled.

Pursuant to the provisions of the Hague Convention on choice of court agreements, judgments issued by courts
in Mexico, Montenegro, Moldova, Singapore, Ukraine and the United Kingdom, that are based on exclusive
choice of court agreement concluded in civil or commercial matters will, provided that such judgment has effect
and is enforceable in the country of origin, be recognized or enforceable in Finland in accordance with, and
subject to the exceptions and limitations of, the Hague Convention. The Hague Convention is applicable to
exclusive choice of court agreements concluded after its entry into force for the state of the chosen court. The
United Kingdom acceded to the Hague Convention individually on January 1, 2021 and prior to this, was a

401


-----

party by virtue of its membership of the EU; it is an unresolved question whether the Hague Convention would
apply to choice of court agreements choosing UK courts concluded before January 1, 2021.

In the event that the jurisdiction clause between parties to contract is non-exclusive, the Hague Convention on
choice of court agreements does not apply. The Hague Judgments Convention of 2019 entered into force on 1
September 2023 between the European Union Member States and Ukraine on 1 September 2023 and on 1
October 2024 in relation to Uruguay. The Hague Judgments Convention of 2019 applies to judgments where
there is a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause, including asymmetrical jurisdiction clauses, and so is broader in
scope than the Hague Convention from 2005. The United Kingdom has signed the Hague Judgments
Convention of 2019 in early 2024 but has not yet ratified it. If the United Kingdom does ratify the Hague
Judgments Convention of 2019, the convention will enter into force between the United Kingdom and the other
signatory states 12 months after such ratification.

Foreign arbitral awards are enforceable in Finland pursuant to the New York Convention.

Judgments issued in the courts of a state with which there is no legal instrument for the recognition and
enforcement of judgments are not recognized or enforceable in Finland. As there is no treaty on the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters
between the United States and Finland, courts in Finland will not automatically recognize and enforce a final
judgment rendered by a U.S. court. Under Finnish law, a Finnish title for execution (i.e., a Finnish court
judgment) is required for such recognition and enforcement; in seeking a Finnish court judgment or order to
such effect, a judgment of a U.S. court will constitute circumstantial evidence of the questions of fact in the
case concerned and evidence of the governing law as applied to the matter in dispute.

As to types of damages awarded, punitive or exemplary damages are unenforceable under Finnish law and a
Finnish court may only award damages to the extent that they form compensation of actual losses and damages
as proven by the claimant. A feature of the Finnish civil procedure is that the burden of proof with respect to
any claims presented lies, with certain rare exceptions, with the claimant.

A party to legal proceedings in Finland is also ordinarily expected to plead its case primarily on the basis of the
evidence in its own possession. U.S. notions of discovery, including the expectation that broadly defined
categories of documents and information in the possession of third parties will be readily accessible for use as
evidence, are not recognized under Finnish law. The availability of documentation in the possession of
counterparties or third parties is limited, and a party seeking to obtain such documents is required to be able to
specify such documents with relative precision. Depositions are also a form of taking evidence unknown to
Finnish law. In Finland, witness testimony is usually only taken at a separate oral main hearing (comparable to
a U.S. trial) after the preparatory phase of the proceedings.

Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, restructuring, insolvency, reorganization
or moratorium, as well as other similar mandatory laws affecting creditor’s rights generally.

###### UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION

 Introduction 

This section includes unaudited pro forma financial information for (i) the three-months ended March 31, 2024 and
(ii) the financial year ended December 31, 2023, together with related explanatory notes (collectively, the
“Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information”).

The following Unaudited Pro forma Financial Information of Assemblin Caverion Group AB (formerly known as
Assemblin Group AB) reflects the pro forma impacts of the acquisitions of Assemblin Financing AB (“Assemblin
**Financing Group”) and Caverion Corporation (“Caverion”) (by way of the acquisition of Crayfish HoldCo Oy),**
each of which is described below.

  - Acquisition of Assemblin Financing Group

`o` On May 3, 2023 Assemblin Caverion Group AB (formerly Assemblin Group AB) acquired 100%
of Assemblin Financing AB (formerly Assemblin Group AB). The purchase consideration
amounted to SEK 5 885 million and Assemblin Caverion Group AB obtained a shareholder
contribution of SEK 4 467 million. The acquisition of Assembling Financing was financed with
this shareholder contribution and with a shareholder loan.

  - Acquisition of Caverion

`o` Crayfish BidCo Oy (“Crayfish Bidco”), a Finnish company controlled by Triton Fund V,
announced on January 10, 2023, a public cash tender offer for all the shares in Caverion Oyj (the
“Triton Offer”). On November 6, 2023, Crayfish BidCo announced final results of the Triton
Offer, where the shares validly tendered represented approximately 94.39 per cent. In aggregate
of all the issued and outstanding shares and votes in Caverion Oyj (excluding treasury shares).
On November 28, 2023, Crayfish BidCo announced that it will commence redemption
proceedings in respect of the remaining minority shares in Caverion Oyj.

On April 1, 2024, the completion of a transaction pursuant was announced, to which the ultimate
shareholder, Triton, transferred 100% of the share capital held by it in Crayfish Holdco Oy
(“Crayfish Holdco”), the indirect parent of the Caverion Group, to Assemblin Caverion Group
AB in an acquisition to create a leading northern European technical and service installation
company. The aggregate consideration of SEK 10,585 million (EUR 918 million equivalent) for
the acquisition of Caverion was funded by (i) an unconditional shareholder contribution in an
amount of SEK 4,822 million (EUR 418 million equivalent) (the “Shareholder Contribution”)
and (ii) a shareholder loan in the amount of SEK 5,727 (EUR 500 million equivalent based on
EUR/SEK exchange rate from the European Central Bank of 11.4535 as of March 26, 2024) (the
“Shareholder Bridge Loan”). For pro forma purpose, the Shareholder Bridge Loan has been
included in the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of financial position as of
March 31, 2024 based on the EUR/SEK exchange rate as of March 31, 2024 (equivalent to SEK
5,763 million).

The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information has been prepared to illustrate the hypothetical effects, the
acquisitions of Assemblin Financing AB and Caverion, might have had on Assemblin Caverion Group AB’s:

i. unaudited condensed consolidated statement of financial position as of March 31, 2024 as if the
acquisition of Caverion occurred on March 31, 2024, and
ii. unaudited condensed consolidated statement of profit or loss for the three- months ended March
31, 2024 and the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the financial year ended December

1


-----

31, 2023 as if the acquisitions of Assemblin Financing AB and Caverion occurred on January 1,
2023.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information included herein is not necessarily indicative of what the
consolidated statement of financial position of Assemblin Caverion Group AB would have been if the acquisition
of Caverion had been completed as of the date indicated and of what the consolidated statement of profit or loss of
Assemblin Caverion Group AB would have been if the acquisition Assemblin Financing AB and Caverion had
been completed as of the date indicated, nor do they purport to project the future consolidated financial position or
consolidated profit of Assemblin Caverion Group AB. The actual consolidated financial position and consolidated
profit may differ significantly from the pro forma amounts reflected herein due to a variety of factors. The
Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect the costs
of any integration activities or cost savings or synergies that may be achieved as a result of the acquisitions of
Assemblin Financing AB and Caverion.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information reflects transaction accounting adjustments management believes
are necessary to demonstrate the effect the acquisitions of Assemblin Financing AB and Caverion, might have had,
on the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of profit or loss of Assemblin Caverion Group AB
and unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of profit or loss of Assemblin Caverion Group AB and to
demonstrate the effect the acquisition of Assemblin Financing AB and Caverion, might have had, on the unaudited
pro forma condensed consolidated statement of financial position following the acquisitions of Assemblin
Financing AB and Caverion as of and for the period indicated. The transaction related adjustments are based on
currently available information and assumptions management believes are, under the circumstances and given the
information available at this time, reasonable, and reflective of adjustments necessary to report the consolidated
statement of financial position and consolidated statement of profit loss as if the acquisitions of Assemblin
Financing AB and Caverion were completed on the assumed dates. Due to being a recent assessment of net asset
values included in the preliminary purchase price allocation are still to be finalized. Management’s best estimate is
that changes in valuation of items in the purchase price allocation would also affect the preliminary amount of
goodwill.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of
Regulation S-X under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the regulation of the European Union (EU)
2017/1129, U.S. GAAP or IFRS. Neither the adjustments nor the resulting pro forma financial information have
been audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted auditing standards. The Unaudited Pro Forma
Financial Information should be read in conjunction with the historical condensed consolidated and consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto of Assemblin Caverion Group AB, Assemblin Financing AB and Caverion
Oyj, included elsewhere in this offering memorandum, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations—Assemblin” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial_
_Condition and Results of Operations—Caverion.”_

**Acquisition**

**Assets and liabilities in the the acquisition (SEK million) April 1, 2024** **of Caverion**

Intangible assets (excl goodwill) 1 936
Property, plant and equipment 232
Right of use assets 1 672
Long-term receivables 186
Total current assets 7 513
Total non-current liabilites -6 412

_Group Goodwill_ _15 876_
**Total puchase price** **10 585**

**Consideration settled** **10 585**

- The group goodwill recognized in the preliminary purchase price allocation is mainly attributable to expected synergies
from combining operations of the former Assemblin Group and Caverion Group as well as a growth agenda, a beneficial
business model and a strong organizational culture. None of the goodwill is expected to be deducted for tax purpose.

A preliminary purchase price allocation of the Caverion acquisition has been prepared, applying IFRS 3
“Business Combination. In the preliminary purchase price allocation, the allocation of identifiable assets
and liabilities is measured at fair value. The difference between the consideration and the acquired group’s
identifiable assets and liabilities including acquisition-related intangible assets is recognised as goodwill
in the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of financial position. Goodwill is not subject
to amortization but will be tested yearly for impairment or when there is an indication of impairment.

Acquisition-related intangible assets have been identified in the preliminary purchase price allocation
relating to order back log, brand and other acquisition related intangible assets. The estimated useful life
for a large proportion of the order back log is two years, and a minor proportion of the order back log has
an estimated longer useful life. Brand has an estimated indefinite useful life. The fair values of Caverion
Group’s intangible assets (order backlog, brand and other acquisition related intangibles) have been
measured provisionally, pending completion of independent valuation.

Leases in the PPA has been remeasured by way of adjusting the long-term lease liabilities to a value
corresponding to the recognized value of rights-of-use assets in Caverion Oyj’s condensed consolidated
statement of financial position. This is the preliminary assessment.

Deferred taxes have been considered where applicable.

Assets such as inventory, ongoing projects and leasing related items are to be valued and the information
is still assessed for completeness. The group has conducted preliminary assessment of the provisions.
Other assets and liabilities might also be subject to reassessment.

The preliminary purchase price allocation has been based on available information and may change as
Assemblin Caverion Group AB receives additional information regarding Crayfish HoldCo Oy, Crayfish
BidCo Oy and the Caverion Oyj group, and adjustments may be made both concerning acquired net
assets, acquisition-related intangible assets, taxes and consequently goodwill. The purchase price
allocation regarding the Caverion acquisition is preliminary due to assessment of net asset values included

in the purchase price allocation still are to be finalized.

The preliminary purchase allocation is expected to be finalized no later than December 31, 2024.

Based on the preliminary purchase price allocation the transaction accounting adjustments in the
unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of financial position includes adjustments for the
difference between the fair value and the carrying amount for the acquired group’s identifiable assets and
liabilities. Refer to note 4 Adjustments to the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information.

-----

Assemblin Financing AB on May 3, 2023 was funded by (i) an unconditional shareholder contribution of
SEK 4,467 million (ii) a shareholder loan. The shareholder loan was repaid July 3, 2023.

For pro forma purposes the shareholder loan has been treated as interest free during the initial six-month
period in accordance with the terms of the loan.

_Assemblin Caverion Group AB’s acquisition of Caverion_

The aggregate consideration of SEK 10,585 million (EUR 918 million equivalent) for the acquisition of
Caverion (by way of the acquisition of Crayfish HoldCo Oy), as at April 1, 2024, was funded by (i) an
unconditional Shareholder Contribution in an amount of SEK 4,822 million (EUR 418 million equivalent)
and (ii) the Shareholder Bridge Loan in the amount of SEK 5,727 (EUR 500 million equivalent).

According to the loan agreement, the Shareholder Bridge Loan is interest free during the initial six-month
period (the “initial period“). After the initial period, an interest of 0.5 percent per annum incurs for the
remaining maturity of the loan until the actual repayment date (December 31, 2030, at the latest).

The Shareholder Bridge Loan of SEK 5,727 (EUR 500 million equivalent) has, based on the EUR/SEK
exchange rate as of March 31, 2024, for pro forma purposes been included at amount of SEK 5,763
million as previously commented upon and, in accordance with the terms of the loan, been treated as
interest free during the initial six-month period and incurring an interest of 0.5 percent for the remaining
six-month period of the financial year ended December 31, 2023. Further, for pro forma purposes, in
accordance with the terms of the loan, incurring an interest of 0.5 percent for the three-months ended
March 31, 2024.

The acquisition financing, consisting partly of the Shareholder Bridge Loan described above, and, and
partly of bank debt acquisition financing described in the section, “Crayfish acquisition of Caverion”
below, is expected to be refinanced in due course as part of the capital structure post-combination. Refer
to the section Use of proceeds.

**Crayfish acquisition of Caverion**

Further, in connection with Crayfish BidCo Oy’s acquisition of Caverion Oyj, Crayfish BidCo Oy
obtained a Facility B term loan amounting to EUR 410 million which was partly assigned to Caverion
Oyj. The Facility B term loan has been used to fund consideration for Caverion Oyj shares amounting to
EUR 242 million and refinancing of debt in Caverion Oyj amounting to EUR 130 million. The refinanced
debt mainly refers to a bond amounting to EUR 75 million and a term loan amounting to EUR 50 million.
Further, EUR 38 million has been allocated to be used to finance acquisition of the minority redemption
shares.

Facility B term loan incurs interest at a rate of 3-month or 6-month EURIBOR plus a margin which varies
over time. For pro forma profit or loss statement purposes the 3-month and 6-month EURIBOR as of
April 2, 2024 has been assumed as if all drawdowns were made on January 1, 2023 and as if Facility B
term loan was fully utilized on that date. These increased interest expenses (included in financial
expenses) are included in pro forma adjustments in the unaudited consolidated and unaudited condensed
consolidated pro forma profit or loss statement with an amount exceeding the Facility B term loan interest
expenses recognized in the accounts of Crayfish BidCo Oy and Caverion Oyj. Further, the interest

13


-----

expenses relating to refinanced debt has been added back and reduced the interest expenses for pro forma
purposes.

This resulted in a pro forma increase of financial expenses for interest expenses by SEK 311 million for
the financial year ended December 31, 2023 and increased interest expenses, (included in financial
expenses) by SEK 7 million for three-months period ended March, 31 2024.

A 1/8 of a percentage point increase or decrease in the variable base rate of the EUR 410 million Facility
B term loan would result in a change in pro forma interest expense of approximately SEK 1 million for the
three-months ended March, 31 2024 and approximately SEK 6 million for the financial year ended
December 31, 2023.

Debt issuance expenses relating to Facility B term loan amounts to approximately EUR 13 million.
Further there are also other borrowing fees relating to Facility B term loan. For pro forma profit or loss
statement purposes for calculation of borrowing fees it has been assumed that all drawdowns were made
on and that the Facility B term loan was fully utilized on January 1, 2023. The debt issuance costs have
been expensed over the maturity of the Facility B term loan of 3 years.

These increased borrowing expenses (included in financial expenses) are included in the unaudited
consolidated and condensed consolidated pro forma profit or loss statement with an amount exceeding the
Facility B term loan borrowing expenses recognised in the accounts of Crayfish BidCo Oy and Caverion
Oy.

This resulted in a pro forma adjustment for borrowing expenses, presented as increased financial expenses
for the financial year ended December 31, 2023 amounting to SEK 35 million and decreased financial
expenses for the three-months ended March 31, 2024 amounting to SEK 7 million.

in the unaudited consolidated and condensed consolidated pro forma profit or loss statement and the
unaudited condensed statement of financial position.

       We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
        Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer
        The Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated
        financial statements and that they give a fair presentation in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as
        adopted by the EU. The Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer are also responsible for such internal
        control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free
         from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
           In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer are
        responsible for the assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. They disclose, as applicable,
        matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis of
        accounting is however not applied if the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer intends to liquidate the
        Group, to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
        Auditor’s responsibility
        Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole
         are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes
         our opinions. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted
           in accordance with ISAs and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect a material
        misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually
          or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the
        basis of these consolidated financial statements.
        As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional
        skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

         — Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
             due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit
            evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. The risk of not detecting a
             material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve
              collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentation, or the override of internal control.
         — Obtain an understanding of the Group’s internal control relevant to our audit in order to design audit
            procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on
              the effectiveness of the internal control.
         — Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
             and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer.
         — Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ and the Chief Executive Officer’s use of the
             going concern basis of accounting in preparing the consolidated financial statements. We also draw a
            conclusion, based on the audit evidence obtained, as to whether any material uncertainty exists related to
            events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
                   If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report
                to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate,
                to modify our opinion about the consolidated financial statements. Our conclusions are based on the audit
            evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause
                 a Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
         — Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including
              the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions
             and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
         — Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or
            business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We
             are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely
            responsible for our opinions.
       We must inform the Board of Directors of, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit. We
        must also inform of significant audit findings during our audit, including any significant deficiencies in internal control
         that we identified.

###### Note 1 – Material accounting policies

**Basis of preparation**

These consolidated financial statements of Assemblin Financing AB (formerly Assemblin Group AB, Corp. ID No 559077‐5952) for
the financial years 2022 and 2021 have been prepared for a purpose of inclusion in an offering memorandum, since the parent
Assemblin Caverion Group AB (formerly Assemblin Group AB and Apollo Swedish Bidco AB, Corp. ID No. 559427‐2006) intend to
issue a bond that is planned to be listed The International Stock Exchange. The consolidated financial statements of Assemblin
Financing (“the Group”) include Assemblin Financing AB (Corp. ID No 559077‐5952) and its subsidiaries. A complete register of the
entities that constitute the Group is presented in the consolidated financial statements, see Note 29.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards and the interpretations
of the IFRS Interpretations Committee as adopted by the EU.

**Statement of compliance**

The consolidated financial statements for the years 2022 and 2021 were approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 29 May
2024.

**Valuation criteria**

Assets and liabilities are recognized at historical cost, except for certain financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair
value. Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value consist of unlisted shares and participations, contingent consideration
as well as derivatives.

**Functional currency and reporting currency**

The parent company’s functional currency is the Swedish krona, which also constitutes the reporting currency for the Group. This
means that the financial statements are presented in Swedish kronor. Unless otherwise indicated, all amounts in the Annual
Report are rounded to the nearest million Swedish kronor (SEK million), which can result in a rounding difference.

**Amended accounting policies attributable to new or amended IFRS**

Amendments with regard to IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets are applied as of 1 January 2022. With
regard to provisions, the costs to be included when reporting onerous contracts are clarified, and it did not have any significant
impact on Assemblin Financing’s consolidated financial statements, as the Group already included certain indirect costs
attributable to individual projects in its provisions for onerous contracts.

The amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements aims to increase the usefulness of disclosures regarding the
accounting principles applied by encouraging only material principles to be described and that such descriptions explain how the
principles are applied. Accordingly, the description of the accounting principles has concentrated more on material principles and
focused more on the application of these principles.

**Operating segments**

Operating segments are reported in accordance with the internal reporting to Group Management (the highest executive decision‐
maker). Group management is responsible for allocating resources to the operating segments and evaluating their financial
performance and is also the body that makes strategic decisions. The Group’s operating segments are Assemblin Electrical,
Assemblin H&S (Heating & Sanitation), Assemblin Ventilation, Assemblin Norway and Assemblin Finland. Refer to Note 3 for
additional descriptions and presentations of the operating segments.

**Consolidation principles and business combinations**

Subsidiaries are companies over which the Group exerts a controlling interest. A controlling influence exists when the Group is
exposed to or is entitled to variable returns from its holdings in the company and can affect the return through its controlling
influence over the Company. Contingent considerations are measured at fair value at the acquisition date. In cases where the
contingent consideration is classified as an equity instrument, no restatement is performed and settlement is made within equity.
Other contingent considerations recognised as liabilities are restated as per each reporting date, with the change being recognised
in profit/loss for the period.

**Joint ventures**

In the accounts, joint ventures are those companies for which the Group, through partnership agreements with one or more
parties, has a joint controlling interest in which the Group has the right to net assets instead of a direct right to assets and

F1‐7


-----

commitments in liabilities. Holdings in joint ventures are consolidated in the financial statements in accordance with the equity
method.

**_Equity method_**

The equity method means that in the Group, the carrying amount of the shares in joint ventures corresponds to the Group’s share
of equity in joint ventures. The Group’s participation in the earnings of joint ventures is recognized in profit/loss for the period.
These shares of profits constitute the primary change in the carrying amount of shares in joint ventures.

Acquisition‐related expenses that arise are included in the cost. The equity method is applied from the date on which the joint
controlling influence is obtained until the time when the joint controlling influence ceases.

**Foreign currency translation**

**_Financial statements from operations abroad_**

Assets and liabilities in the Group’s foreign operations, including goodwill and other Group‐related surpluses and deficits, are
restated from the functional currency of the foreign operations to the Group’s reporting currency at the exchange rate in effect
at each period‐end. Non‐current loans to subsidiaries designated, by the parent, as part of its net investment in the foreign
operation are treated as equity for translational purposes with the differences being recognised in comprehensive income.
Revenue and expenses in operations abroad are restated in Swedish kronor at an average rate that constituted an approximation
of the exchange rates that were in effect on the respective transaction dates. Translation differences arising in connection with
currency translations are recognised in Other comprehensive income, and are accumulated in a separate component in equity,
designated as translation reserves. When a controlling influence or joint controlling influence in foreign operations ceases, the
accumulated translation differences are realised through a transfer from the translation reserve in equity to profit/loss for the
period.

**Revenue**

The Group’s revenue consists primarily of revenue from construction and service assignments. Revenue recognition for
construction and service assignments take place as control is transferred to the customer. The construction assignments mean
that the Group designs and installs technical systems for electrical, heating, sanitation and ventilation in customers’ offices, arenas,
shopping centers, homes and industrial premises. The Group creates an asset over which the customer gains control in pace with
the asset being completed. This means that revenue from construction assignments is reported over time. For service assignments
such as maintenance and operational work, the customer benefits in pace with the services being performed, meaning that these
revenues are also reported over time.

**_Installation assignments_**

For fixed‐price agreements, revenue is recognized based on the assignment expenditures incurred in relation to the total
estimated assignment expenditures. Since there is a direct relationship between the expenses incurred by the Group for its
assignments and the transfer to customers of the benefits, this method is considered to accurately measure the degree to which
the performance obligation is fulfilled. Costs attributable to construction assignments are recognized in profit or loss when
incurred. Most of the Group’s construction contracts are subject to fixed‐price agreements, with variable compensation in only a
few exceptional cases. Changes to agreements related to remodeling or supplementary work are recognized to the extent they
have been agreed with the customer. Claims and incentive compensation are included in the project revenue only to the extent
that it is highly unlikely that a significant reversal of accumulated reported revenue will occur.

Payment is usually received in stages during the completion of a contracting agreement and payment is usually received before
the relevant stage commences. In some contracting assignments, however, payment is received following the relevant stage. If
the services provided by the Group exceed invoiced amounts (after deductions for any reported losses), a contractual asset is
reported. Partially invoiced amounts that have not yet been settled by the customer, and amounts held by the client are included
in Trade receivables. If invoicing exceeds the services delivered (after deduction of any reported losses), a contractual liability is
reported.

A fundamental condition for recognizing revenue over time is that the outcome can reasonably be measured against completion
of the performance obligation. If it is not reasonably possible to measure the outcome of a project reliably, the income is reported
at the corresponding amount as the accrued expense, that is, no earnings are recognized while awaiting the determination of the
earnings. Reporting revenue in pace with completion contains a component of uncertainty. Unforeseen events sometimes occur
resulting in earnings that are higher or lower than originally expected. If circumstances change, estimates regarding revenue,
expenses or the degree of completion are revised. Increases or decreases in estimated revenue or expenses attributable to revised
estimates are reported in profit or loss in the period in which the circumstances that gave rise to the audit became known to
management.

F1‐8


-----

If likely that the estimated project expenses in a contracting agreement will exceed the estimated project revenues, the expected
loss is immediately reported in its entirety as a cost. The Group’s commitment to rectify errors and deficiencies in completed
projects in accordance with normal guarantee rules is reported as a provision in the statement of financial position and as an
expense in profit or loss.

**_Service assignments_**

As regards service assignments, revenue and the appurtenant costs are recognized over time (that is, in pace with the Group
performing the service). For agreements at a fixed price, revenue is reported based on the proportion of the total agreed service
delivered during the period. This is determined based on the assignment expenditures incurred in relation to the total estimated
assignment expenditures. Since there is a direct relationship between the expenses incurred by the Group for its assignments and
the transfer to customers of the benefits, this method is considered to accurately measure the degree to which the performance
commitment is fulfilled. For contracts on a current account where the Group is entitled to compensation in relation to the value
of fulfilled commitments, revenue is reported to the extent that the Group is entitled to invoice. In cases where invoicing takes
place in arrears, a contractual asset is reported. In cases where payment is made in advance regarding service contracts, a
contractual liability is reported.

**_Significant financing components_**

The Group has no agreements according to which the time between the handover of services or contracts to the customer and
the payment from the customer exceeds one year. As a result, the Group does not adjust the transaction price for the effects of a
significant financing component.

**Financial income and expenses**

Financial income consists of interest income on invested funds, dividend income, gains on changes in value of financial assets
measured at fair value through profit or loss, and exchange rate gains.

Dividend income is recognized when the right to receive dividends has been established.

Financial expenses consist of interest charged on loans, and the effect of unwinding the present value of provisions, and exchange
rate losses.

Interest income on receivables and interest expenses on liabilities are calculated using the effective interest method. The effective
interest rate is the interest rate that makes the present value of all estimated future inflows and outflows during the expected
term equal to the carrying amount of the receivable or liability. Foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized net. Exchange
rate changes regarding operating receivables and liabilities are reported in operating profit, while exchange rate changes regarding
financial receivables and liabilities are reported in net financial items.

**Tax**

Income tax consists of current tax and deferred tax. Income tax is recognized in profit or loss, except when underlying transactions
were recognized in other comprehensive income or in equity, whereupon the appurtenant tax effect is recognized in other
comprehensive income or in equity respectively.

Current tax is tax that is to be paid or received as regards the current year, with application of the tax rates determined in fact or
in practice on the balance sheet date. Adjustment of current tax attributable to earlier periods also belongs to current tax.

Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the recognized and taxable values of assets and liabilities, as well
as on tax deficits. Deferred tax liabilities attributable to temporary differences regarding participations in subsidiaries are not
reported in cases where the Group can control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is unlikely that they
will be reversed within the foreseeable future. Measurement of deferred tax is based on how the underlying assets or liabilities
are expected to be realized or settled. Deferred tax is calculated applying tax rates and tax regulations determined, or essentially
determined, as of the balance sheet date and that are expected to apply when the relevant deferred tax asset is realized or the
deferred tax liability is settled.

Deferred tax assets are reported if it is likely that these will be utilized against future taxable surpluses. The value of deferred tax
assets is reduced when it is no longer deemed likely that they can be utilized.

Any future income tax that arises in connection with a dividend is reported on the same date as when the dividend is recognized
as a liability.

**Financial assets and financial liabilities: Financial instruments**

**_Classification of financial assets_**

F1‐9


-----

The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories:

– financial assets reported at amortized cost, and
– financial assets reported at fair value either via the income statement or via other comprehensive income.

The classification is attributable to the Group’s business model for managing financial assets and the contractual terms of the
assets’ cash flows. Financial assets are only reclassified in cases where the Group’s business model for the instruments changes.
A summary of the classifications of the Group’s financial instruments is presented in Note 20.

**_Subsequent measurement of financial assets_**

Subsequent measurement depends on the Group’s business model for managing of the asset and the type of cash flows to which
the asset gives.

_Amortized cost_

Assets held with the purpose of collecting contractual cash flows where such cash flows solely comprise principal and interest, are
reported at amortized cost, applying the effective interest method. Impairment losses are reported on the Cost of production line
in income statement. All of the Group’s financial assets, except for holdings of unlisted shares and participations and derivatives,
are measured at amortized cost.

_Fair value through other comprehensive income_

The Group measures holdings of unlisted shares and participations at fair value through other comprehensive income. No
subsequent reclassification of fair value changes is made in profit or loss when the instrument is removed from the statement of
financial position. Impairment losses (and reversals of impairment losses) are not reported separately from other changes in fair
value. Dividends are reported in profit or loss as financial income when the Group’s right to receive payment has been determined.

Derivatives with a positive fair value are recognized as derivative assets; refer further to “Hedge accounting”.

**_Derivatives and hedge accounting_**

The Group holds financial derivatives to hedge transactions foreign currency. Derivatives are recognized in the statement of
financial position as per the transaction date and measured at fair value, both initially and on subsequent remeasurement at the
end of each reporting period. The method of recognizing the gain or loss arising on remeasurement depends on whether the
derivative is recognized as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.

The Group identifies derivatives as hedges of certain risks attributable to the cash flow from a recognized asset, liability or highly
likely projected transaction (cash flow hedging).

On entering into the transaction, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item,
as well as the Group’s risk management objectives and risk management strategy regarding the hedging. The Group also
documents its assessment, both on entering into the hedge and thereafter, of whether the derivative instruments used in hedging
transactions have been, and will continue to be, effective in counteracting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the
hedged items.

Information on the fair value of derivative instruments used for hedging purposes can be found in Note 18. The fair value of a
derivative that is a hedging instrument is classified as a non‐current asset or non‐current liability when the remaining term of the
hedged item exceeds 12 months, and as a current asset or current liability when the outstanding term of the hedged item is less
than 12 months.

**_Derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting_**

All of the Group’s derivatives meet the requirements for hedge accounting.

F1‐10


-----

**_Cash flow hedges_**

When a derivative is identified as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the derivative
is recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedge reserve in equity. The effective portion of the changes
in fair value in the derivative recognized in other comprehensive income is limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the
hedged item, determined on a present value basis, from the start of the hedge. Ineffective portions of changes in fair value in the
derivative are recognized immediately in earnings.

For the hedged forecast transactions, the accumulated amount in the hedge reserve is reclassified to earnings in the same
period(s) that the hedged anticipated cash flow impacts earnings.

If the hedged cash flow is no longer expected to arise, the amount that has accumulated in the hedge reserve is immediately
reclassified to earnings.

**_Classification and subsequent measurement of financial liabilities_**

All financial liabilities except derivatives and contingent purchase considerations, are recognized at amortized cost.

**_Impairment of financial assets_**

Financial assets reported at amortized cost and subject to impairment relate mainly to accounts receivable and contractual assets.
The Group applies the simplified method when calculating expected credit losses.

The simplification means that reserves are set aside for an amount corresponding to expected credit losses during the entire term
of the receivable. The reserve is taken into account on initial recognition and is then revalued during the term of the receivable.

Contractual assets are attributable to work that has not yet been invoiced and bear essentially the same risk characteristics as
work invoiced for the same type of contract. The Group therefore considers that the loss levels for accounts receivable are a
reasonable estimate of the loss levels for contractual assets.

Calculation of expected credit losses is primarily based on information about historical losses for similar receivables and
counterparties. Historical losses are then adjusted to take into account current and forward‐looking information that may affect
customers’ ability to pay the claim.

**_Write off_**

The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when the Group has no reasonable expectation of recovering the
financial asset either entirely or in part. Before writing it off, the Group assesses each asset individually on the basis of the specific
customer. The Group expects no significant recovery of the amounts written off. Financial assets that have been written off may
nonetheless remain subject to enforcement measures to comply with the Group’s procedures for the recovery of past‐due
amounts.

**Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are recognized in the Group at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment. The cost
includes the purchase price and expenditures directly attributable to the asset for bringing it on site and in usable condition in
accordance with the purpose for which it was procured.

**_Additional expenses_**

Subsequent expenditures are added to the cost only if it is likely that the future economic benefits associated with the asset will
flow to the company and if the cost can be reliably calculated. All other subsequent expenditures are recognized as costs in the
period they arise. A subsequent expenditure is added to the cost if the expenditure relates to the replacement of identified
components or parts thereof. Even in cases where new components are created, the expenditure is added to the cost. Any
unimpaired carrying amounts on replaced components or parts of components are disposed of and expensed conjunction with
replacement. Repairs are expensed on a running basis.

**_Depreciation policies_**

Depreciation occurs on a straight‐line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset; land is not impaired.

_Estimated useful life:_

— machinery and other technical assets, 5–12 years
— furniture, tools, fixtures and fittings 5–10 years
— expenses for improvements to the property of others are depreciated across the term of the contract

F1‐11


-----

The depreciation methods applied, residual values and useful lives are reassessed at the end of every year.

**_Leased assets_**

When an agreement is signed, the Group judges whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if
it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Group mainly
leases premises and vehicles. Leases are recognized as rights of use and a corresponding liability as of the date the leased asset is
available for use by the Group. The lease liability is initially reported at the present value of the remaining lease fees during the
term of the lease, amounts expected to be paid out in accordance with any residual value guarantees, the price of call options if
the Group expects these to be exercised and any penalties for terminating an agreement if the Group deems it reasonable that
the agreement will be terminated. Lease expenses include fixed expenses and variable lease payments that depend on an index
or a rate. Agreements can contain both lease and non‐lease components. Payments for non‐lease components have been excluded
from the calculation of the lease liability. The right‐of‐use asset is initially measured at cost, which consists of the initial value of
the lease liability plus lease expenses paid on or before the commencement date and any initial direct expenses. The right‐of‐use
asset is depreciated on a straight‐line basis from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the asset
and the end of the lease term, which, for the Group, is normally the end of the leasing period. In the rarer cases, in which the cost
of the right‐of‐use asset reflects the Group exercising an option to purchase the underlying asset, the asset is depreciated until
the end of its useful life.

The term of the lease comprises the agreement’s non‐cancellable period, with the addition of further periods in the contract if,
on the commencement date, it is deemed reasonably certain that these will be exercised. When the lease’s length is determined,
all available information is taken into account that provides a financial incentive to use an extension option, or to not use an option
to terminate an agreement. Opportunities to extend an agreement are only included in the length of the leasing agreement if it is
reasonably certain that the agreement will be extended (or not terminated). Most of the extension options relating to the leasing
of premises and vehicles have not been included in the lease liability as the Group can replace the assets without significant
expenses or interruptions in operations and does not consider that it is reasonably certain that the options will be exercised.

The values of the liability and the asset are adjusted in conjunction with a reassessment of the lease term. This occurs in
conjunction with the passing of the final cancellation date in a previously assessed lease term, or alternately when significant
events take place or when circumstances have changed significantly within the control of the Group and impact the existing
assessment of the lease term.

Lease payments have been discounted by the incremental borrowing rate as regards leased premises, and by the implicit interest
rate as regards vehicles. To determine the marginal lending rate, if possible, financing recently received by a third party is used as
a starting point. If no loans from third parties exist in the near future, a method is used that is based on a risk‐free interest rate
that is adjusted for credit risk. Adjustments are made for the specific terms of the agreement, e.g. term of the lease, country and
currency.

The Group is exposed to any future increases of variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate that are not included
in the lease liability before they enter force. When adjustments of lease payments that depend on an index or a rate enter force,
the lease liability is restated against the right‐of‐use asset.

Lease payments are divided between repayment of the liability and interest. Interest is recognized in the statement of earnings
and the statement of comprehensive income over the term of the lease. Right of use assets are normally depreciated on a straight‐
line basis over the shorter of the useful life and the lease term. Payments for agreements of less than one year and low‐value
leases are expensed on a straight‐line basis in the statement of earnings and the statement of comprehensive income.

**Intangible assets**

**_Goodwill_**

Goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment. Goodwill arising from business combinations is allocated to cash‐
generating units or groups of units that are expected to benefit from the business combination. Goodwill is tested for impairment
annually or more frequently if events or altered circumstances indicate a possible impairment. Each unit or group of units to which
goodwill has been allocated corresponds to the lowest level in the Group at which the goodwill in question is monitored in the
internal control, which, for the Group, is the operating segment level.

**_Other intangible assets_**

Other intangible assets include the order backlog, brands and capitalized development expenses. Other intangible assets, with the
exception of brands, are recognized at cost less accumulated amortization (see below) and any impairment. Brands are judged to
have an indefinite useful life.

F1‐12


-----

Brands are tested for impairment annually and as soon as there are any indication that the asset in question having decreased in
value.

**_Amortization policies_**

Amortization is recognized on a straight‐line basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets, provided that such
useful lives are not indefinite. The useful lives are reviewed at least yearly. Goodwill and other intangible assets that are not yet
ready for use, are reviewed for impairment requirements on a yearly basis and additionally as soon as indications arise showing
that the asset in question has decreased in value. Intangible assets with determinate useful lives are amortized from the date they
are available for use.

_The estimated useful lives are:_

— order backlog 1–2 years
— capitalized development expenditure 3–5 years

**Impairment of non‐financial assets**

The Group’s recognized assets are assessed on every balance sheet date to determine if there are indicators of impairment
requirements.

If there is an indicator of impairment, the recoverable amount of the asset is calculated (see below). For goodwill and brands with
indeterminate useful lives and intangible assets not yet ready for use, the recoverable amount is calculated annually. If materially
independent cash flows cannot be determined for an individual asset, and its fair value less the cost to sell cannot be used, the
assets are grouped for impairment requirements at the lowest level where it is possible to identify materially independent cash
flows; this is known as a cash‐generating unit.

An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset or cash‐generating unit (group of units) exceeds the
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less the cost to sell and value‐in‐use. In calculating value‐
in‐use, future cash flows are discounted by a discount factor that takes into account the risk‐free interest rate and the risk
associated with the specific

**Earnings per share**

The calculation of earnings per share is based on the Group’s profit/loss for the period attributable to the Parent Company’s
shareholders and on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period.

**Employee benefits**

**_Post‐employment benefits_**

In defined contribution plans, the company pays fixed fees to a separate legal entity, and has no obligation to pay additional fees.
The Group’s earnings are expensed for costs in pace with the benefits being vested.

Defined‐benefit plans are other plans for post‐employment benefits than defined‐contribution plans. The Group’s net obligation
regarding defined‐benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan through an estimate of the future benefits the employee
has earned through their employment in both current and previous periods. The Group bears the risk for the plan providing the
benefits offered.

In the statement of financial position, the estimated present value of the liabilities is reported as a provision as the Group only
has unfunded pension plans.

The pension cost and pension obligation for defined‐benefit pension plans are calculated annually by independent actuaries. The
discount rate corresponds to the interest rate as per the balance‐sheet date on mortgage bonds, with a tenor that corresponds to
the Group’s pension obligations. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. Net
interest expenses on the defined‐benefit obligation are recognized in the profit or loss under net financial items. The interest rate
is the interest rate that arises when discounting the obligation. Other components are recognized in operating profit. Revaluation
effects consist of actuarial gains and losses. The effects of remeasurement are recognized in other comprehensive income.

The special employer’s contributions constitute a part of the actuarial assumptions and are therefore recognized as part of the
obligation. For reasons of simplification, the part of the special employer’s contribution in a legal entity that is calculated based
on the Pension Obligations Vesting Act is recognized as an accrued cost instead of as a part of the net obligation.

F1‐13


-----

Tax on returns is recognized on an ongoing basis in the income statement for the period the tax relates to, and is therefore not
included in the liability calculation.

**Inventories**

Inventories are stated at cost or net realizable value, whichever is lower. Cost is calculated according to the first‐in‐first‐out
principle.

**Provisions**

A provision is distinguished from other liabilities in that there is uncertainty around the payment date or the amount to settle the
provision. A provision is recognized in the statement of financial position when there is a legal or informal obligation, as a result
of an event that has occurred, it is probable that an outflow of financial resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the
amount can be reliably estimated.

Provisions are made with the amount that is the best estimation of what will be required to settle the existing obligation the
balance‐sheet date. Where the effect of the timing of the payment is substantial, provisions are calculated through discounting
the anticipated future cash flow at an interest rate before tax that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of
the money and, if appropriate, the risks associated with the liability.

**_Warranties_**

Warranty provisions are reported for warranty commitments under which the Group is obliged to remedy any deficiencies in work
performed or materials used within a certain time frame following the completion of the work. The provision is based on historical
warranty data and a comparison of potential outcomes in relation to the likelihoods associated with each outcome.

**_Restructuring_**

A provision for restructuring is recognized when there is an established, detailed and formal restructuring plan and the
restructuring has either begun or been publicly announced. No provision is made for future operating costs.

**_Onerous leases_**

A provision for onerous leases is recognized when the anticipated benefits that the Group expects to receive from a contract are
lower than the inevitable costs for fulfilling the obligations under the contract. When assessing whether a feared loss exists,
estimated project revenues are compared with the estimated project expenditures.

Estimated project expenses include:

– Expenditure directly related to the individual assignment,
– Indirect expenditure that can be allocated to the individual assignment, and
– Other expenses that, in accordance with the agreement, can be charged to the customer.

Expenses that cannot be attributed to individual assignments are not included in project expenses. Such expenses include:

– General administrative expenses, except in cases where compensation for these is to be paid in accordance with the
agreement
– Sales expenses
– Research and development expenses, except in cases where compensation for these is to be paid in accordance with the
agreement
– Depreciation of machinery and equipment not used on the project.

**Contingent liabilities**

Fulfilment warranties in the form of Parent Company warranties normally comprise 10 percent of the contract sum until the
contract has been handed over to the customer. The handover normally takes place in connection with a final inspection, on
approval. If the warranty covers all or most of the contract sum, the amount of the contingency is calculated as the contract sum
less the value of the portion performed. In cases where the warranty covers only a smaller part of the contract sum, the amount
of the guarantee is carried as an unchanged amount up until the contract is surrendered to the client. These contingent liabilities
are disclosed for the Parent Company.

In cases where a bank or insurance institution issues a completion guarantee to a customer in connection with a contract, these
normally receive, in turn, a counter‐commitment from the contracting company or another Group company. Such counter

F1‐14

obligations relating to own contracts are not recognized as contingencies, since they contain no increased responsibility
compared with the contract commitment.

###### Note 3 – Operating segments

The Group’s operating segments are based primarily on the main operational orientation the segments have. The following five
operating segments have been identified:

— Assemblin Electrical — offers comprehensive solutions for planning, installation, service and maintenance in electricity and
automation. The operations also cover services in security and industrial servicing. A portion of production takes place in the
company’s proprietary electrical power stations.
— Assemblin H&S (Heating & sanitation) — designs, installs and maintains technical systems for heating, sanitation, sprinklers,
industry, energy and cooling in all types of buildings.
— Assemblin Ventilation — specialists in construction, installation, service and maintenance of energy‐smart ventilation
facilities.
— Assemblin Norway — possesses a high degree of competency in primarily electrical, heating and sanitation, and automation.
— Assemblin Finland — operations offer services in electricity, ventilation, heating and sanitation, and in automation and energy
efficiency as well.

These segments are the primary divisions that the company’s chief operating decision makers (Group Management) observe in
terms of earnings, capital requirements and cash flows. The company´s Group Management evaluates the segments’ results on
adjusted EBITA.

Each operating segment has a director who is responsible for the operating activities and reports the outcome from the segment
to Group Management.

The earnings, assets and liabilities of the operating segments have included directly attributable items, as well as items that can
reasonably and reliably be allocated to the segments. The internal price among the Group’s various segments is set under the
“arm’s length” principle (i.e. between parties that are independent of each other, well‐informed and with a shared interest in
performing the transactions).

**Overview of defined benefit plans**

The Group has a defined benefit plan that provides remuneration to employees when they retire. The plan relates only to
Sweden. The defined benefit plan is exposed to actuarial risks such as life expectancy, currency, interest rate and investment
risks. The plan is preliminary attributable to men. Payments to the plan are expected to total SEK 18.7 million (2021: 16.0) over
the next few years.

**_Assumptions for defined benefit obligations_** 2022 2021

Discount rate as of 31 December 4.00% 1.80%

Future salary growth 2.60% 2.70%

Inflation 2.10% 2.20%

The life expectancy assumption is based on published statistics and mortality rates. The current life expectancy on which the
obligation is calculated is based on DUS21 (2021: DUS14). The remaining life expectancy for a 65‐year‐old woman with this life
expectancy assumption is 23.9 years (2021: 24) and 21.8 years (2021: 22) for a man. The total current life expectancy on which
the obligation is calculated is 16 years (2021: 19) to establish a discount rate of 4.00 percent (2021: 1.80).

**Alecta**

For salaried employees in Sweden, the defined benefit pension obligations in the ITP‐2 plan for retirement and family pensions
are secured through insurance with Alecta. According to a statement from the Swedish Financial Reporting Board, this is a defined
benefit plan that covers several employees. For the financial year, the company did not have access to such information as would
make it possible to recognize this plan as a defined benefit plan. The pension plan under ITP secured through insurance with Alecta
is thus recognized as a defined contribution plan.

The premium for the defined benefit retirement and family pension is calculated individually and is based on such factors as the
salary, previously earned pension and expected remaining length of service. Expected contributions in the next reporting period
for ITP 2 insurance with Alecta amount to SEK 20.1 million (2021: 19.7). The Group's share of the total contributions to the pension
scheme is 0.07% (2021: 0.05%), while its share of the total number of active members in the scheme is 0.05% (2021: 0.05%).

Annual fees for pension insurance contracted with Alecta totals SEK 74.2 million (2021: 68.8). Alecta’s surplus can be allocated to
policy holders and/or the insured. The collective consolidation level is normally allowed to vary between 125 and 175 percent. If
Alecta's consolidation level falls below 125 percent or rises above 175 percent, measures must be taken to enable the
consolidation level to return to the normal range. In the event of low consolidation levels, one measure could be raising the
contracted price for new policies and expanding existing benefits. In the event of high consolidation levels, one measure could be
introducing premium reductions. The premiums to Alecta are calculated using assumptions regarding interest rates, life
expectancy, operating costs and tax on returns from pension funds, so that the payment of a consistent amount of premium up
to the date the date of retirement is sufficient to ensure the entire, targeted benefit, based on the insured’s current pensionable
salary, is, in fact earned. The collective consolidation level consists of the market value of Alecta’s actuarial calculations, which do
not correspond with IAS 19. At year end, Alecta’s surplus in the form of the collective consolidation level totaled 172 percent
(2021: 172). There is no agreed framework to guide the process of managing any deficit that may arise. In the first instance, losses
will be covered by Alecta’s collective consolidation capital and will thus not lead to increased costs through higher contractual
premiums. Nor are there guidelines on how surplus of deficits should be allocated in the event of dissolution of the scheme or a
company´s withdrawal from the scheme.

The amortization of Order backlog and Capitalized development costs is allocated to Sales and administrative expenses.

Capitalized development costs are internally generated intangibles.

**Impairment testing of cash generating units containing goodwill**

Assessing the value of the Group’s goodwill items and other intangible assets occurs annually based on the value‐in‐use of the
cash generating units. The value‐in‐use for the respective units is based on a forecast of future cash flows. These were based on

F1‐31


-----

the 2023 budget and subsequently on the business area‐specific assumptions of yearly sales growth, Adjusted EBITDA margin and
working capital requirements for the period from 2024 to 2026. These assumptions were set based on the history of the
operations, the objectives in the business plan, the competitiveness of the operations and an assessment of future trends in the
business cycle.

The most important assumptions in the analysis were future growth rate in revenue, Adjusted EBITDA margin and discount rate.
These assumptions were based on the budget and on forecasts built on previous experiences as well as internal and external
sources of information. The assumptions used to extrapolate beyond the latest forecast period were established through the
company’s ability to retain its margins and grow in line with long‐term market growth/inflation, based on forecasts from central
banks and similar institutions. Discount rates were established using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM, starting from external
assessments of risk‐free rate, volatility, yield requirements on equity and our finance costs for external credit facilities). Annual
growth for the period after 2026 is assumed to be 2.0 per cent (2021: 2.0). The present value of the forecast cash flows has been
calculated with a discount rate of 10.6 per cent (2021: 9.5) before tax, based on a weighted average of the company’s cost for
externally borrowed capital and a theoretical yield requirement on equity considering the specific risk in the business. As of 31
December 2022, the value‐in‐use exceeds the carrying amount for all units tested. Thus, there is no impairment, and no reasonable
possible changes in the material assumptions would give rise to impairment.

###### Note 18 – Financial risks and risk management

Through its operations, the Group is exposed to various types of financial risks.

— Liquidity risk
— Refinancing risk
— Currency risk
— Interest rate risk
— Credit risk

**Framework for financial risk management**

Responsibility for the Group’s financial transactions and risks is managed centrally by the Group’s treasury function, which is part
of the Assemblin Sweden subsidiary. The overall objective for the treasury function is to provide cost effective financing and to
minimize negative effects on the Group’s earnings arising from financial risks.

**Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group cannot meet its immediate payment obligations. To ensure this, the Group has
measures including a three‐month liquidity plan covering all of the Group’s units. There is also a routine for continually ensuring
the holding of suitable credit facilities.

**Refinancing risk**

Refinancing risk related to the risk that the Group does not have sufficient funds available when these are needed to refinance
loans that fall due, or that the Group encounters difficulties in obtaining new facilities at a given point in time. Ensuring these
needs requires both a strong financial position and active measures to ensure access to credits. The refinancing risk is managed
through such measures as long‐term borrowing.

F1‐34


-----

**Currency risk**

Currency risk means the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates will have a negative impact on profit or loss, the statement of
financial position and cash flows. Currency risk can be divided into transaction exposure and translation exposure. Transaction
exposure consists of the net of operating and finance in and outflows in currencies. The Group’s EUR financing is hedged with a
derivative that eliminates the currency risk as regards interest payments and capital liability for which hedge accounting is applied.
Translation exposure consists of the net assets of the Norwegian and Finnish subsidiaries, and their earnings in foreign currencies.

_Sensitivity analysis — currency risk (translation exposure)_

An increase in the EUR/SEK exchange rate of five per cent would negatively or positively impact the Group’s equity by SEK (4.0)
million (2021: (4.0)), whereas a similar increase in the NOK/SEK exchange rate would positively impact equity by SEK 18 million
(2021: 13).

**Interest rate risk**

Interest rate risk means the risk that interest income is negatively affected or that the value of financial instruments varies due to
changes in market interest rates, which can lead to changes in fair values and changes in cash flows. Exposures arise primarily as
a consequence of the Group’s external interest‐bearing borrowings.

_Sensitivity analysis — interest rate risk_

The impact of an interest rate hike of 1 percentage point at the balance sheet date on interest revenue and interest expenses
during the coming twelve‐month period would total SEK 28 million (2021:27), given the interest‐bearing assets and liabilities
existing on the balance‐sheet date (excluding effects from derivatives).

**Credit risk**

_Credit risks in finance operations_

Financial credit risk arises when cash and cash equivalents are invested, and in conjunction with trading in financial instruments.
These are primarily counterparty risks in connection with receivables in banks and other counterparties that arise when purchasing
derivative financial instruments. As of 31 December 2022, receivables from counterparties regarding derivatives amount to SEK
139 million. There are no receivables in counterparties regarding derivatives as of 31 December 2021. For other financial assets,
the credit risk is assumed to correspond to the carrying amounts.

F1‐35


-----

_Credit risks in trade receivables_

The risk that the Group’s or company’s customers cannot fulfil their commitments (i.e. payment is not received from customers)
constitutes a customer credit risk. The Group’s customers are subject to credit checks, in which information about the customers’
financial position is obtained from various credit bureaus. The Group has prepared a credit policy for how customer credits are to
be managed. It indicates, for example, where decisions are made on credit limits of various sizes, and how credits and doubtful
receivables are to be managed. No individual customer represents 10 per cent of net revenue. The Groups companies have
historically had low credit losses, and there are no indications that this will change. For the purpose of assessing the risk in trade
receivables, they are divided into various risks depending on how many days have passed since the due date. Invoices are routinely
sent over the course of the project and in advance. Trade receivables are additionally divided among a great many customers in
various industries and have a broad geographical spread.

###### Note 20 – Measuring financial assets and liabilities at fair value

Measurement at fair value contains a measurement hierarchy regarding input data for the valuations. This measurement hierarchy
is divided into three levels corresponding with the levels introduced in IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.

**_The three levels consist of:_**

Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has access to on the
measurement date.

Level 2: Inputs other than the quoted prices included in Level 1, which are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability.
This can also relate to inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, such as interest rate levels,
yield curves, volatility and multiples.

Level 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. At this level, the assumptions that market participants would make use of
in pricing the asset or liability, including risk assumptions, must be taken into consideration.

**_Classification of fair value_**

Derivatives are valued in accordance with level 2. Fair value adjustments are reported in the hedge reserve. The Group’s
derivatives consist of cross currency interest rate swaps whose fair value is determined by discounting the future cash flows
attributable to the instruments.

Financial assets measured at fair value via other comprehensive income relate primarily to Elajo. Shares in Elajo are recognized at
fair value 30 MSEK (2021: 30). The valuation is executed according to level 3 since the valuation is based on non‐observable inputs.
The fair value has been calculated on the basis of a profit multiple based on operating profit. The profit multiple is derived based
on Assemblin's experience in acquiring unlisted installation companies. In case the profit multiple and/or operating profit
increases, the fair value will also increase. The holdings are recognized through other comprehensive income. Contingent
considerations are reported in accordance with level 3. For all other items, excluding borrowings, the carrying amount is an
approximation of the fair value, which is why these items are not divided into levels under the measurement hierarchy.

Since borrowings via bond loans run with variable interest rates, their carrying amount is also deemed to essentially correspond
to the fair values.

###### Note 21 – Contract assets and contract liabilities 


F1‐38


-----

Historically, Assemblin Financing AB and its subsidiaries have had low confirmed customer losses and this is not deemed to have
changed in 2024 or to do so in the future. When assessing expected credit losses, the receivables are classified in accordance
with the number of days due. The Group’s major customers are credit tested via credit information companies and the
subsidiaries monitor cancelled and late payments closely. The Group invoices customers on an ongoing basis over the
production period, with any credit losses being detected at an early stage. Advance invoicing is also applied in cases where this is
deemed necessary or requested. Accounts receivable are based on a large number of customers and projects in various
industries and geographical areas. The contractual assets amount to SEK 704 million (2021: 450) and relate to accrued but not
invoiced income and are by nature comparable to accounts receivable. In light of Assemblin Finanicng Group’s historically low
credit losses, the impact from the impairment model in accordance with IFRS 9 is considered to be insignificant.

###### Note 22 – Trade receivables

Trade receivables are recognized after taking customer losses totaling SEK 9 million (2021: 3) in the Group into account. Refer to
Note 18 for more information.

**Warranty commitments**

Provisions for warranties relate to assumed expenditures in the future for rectifying errors and shortcomings regarding concluded
projects that arise during the warranty period for the projects. Provisions for warranties are primarily attributable to projects
concluded in 2021 and 2022 whose warranty period is up to five years. The provision is based on calculations of historical warranty
costs and known complaints. The present values of the provisions are not calculated. Further information concerning important
assessments and estimates is provided in Note 30.

**Restructuring, Onerous leases and disputes**

Among other things, restructuring provisions consist of expenses for future settlements related to the closure of unprofitable
branches in announced restructuring programs. In addition, the Group has several rental agreements for premises with long notice
periods that stand unused as a result of reorganizations. Provisions have been made for commitments to pay peripheral expenses
over and above rental expenses during the remainder of the contract period.

For construction contracts where it is likely that the total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is
immediately recognized as a cost in its entirety. An onerous contract is a contract in which the unavoidable costs for meeting the
obligations under the contract exceed the anticipated financial benefits.

Provisions for disputes and other provisions are based on individual risk evaluation as per the balance sheet date and are primarily
related to acquisitions and adjustments of acquisition balances.

###### Note 30 – Critical estimates and judgements

Company management has discussed the development and choice of the Group’s critical accounting policies and estimates, the
information concerning them, and the application of these policies and estimates with the Audit Committee.

**Critical estimates**

Certain critical estimates are described below.

**_Recognition of revenue over time_**

The reported earnings in ongoing contract projects are recognized over time on the basis of assignment expenditures incurred in
relation to the total estimated assignment fees of the assignment. Costs associated with this are recognized in profit or loss as
they arise. This requires reliable calculation of project revenue and project costs. The precondition is a properly functioning system
for cost accounting, forecasting processes and project monitoring. The forecast regarding the project’s final outcome is a critical
judgement that is material to the operating report over the course of the project. There may be a risk that the final result as
regards the project could deviate from what is recognized over time.

**_Pensions_**

Assemblin has defined benefit pension plans. The pension obligations are calculated using actuarial assumptions, as of the balance
sheet date, the present value of the obligations is reported. A change in any of these assumptions and measurements could have
a significant impact on calculated pension commitments and pension costs.

**_Intangible assets_**

_Impairment testing of goodwill_

The recoverable amounts of cash‐generating units are based on the assumption of future conditions and estimates of various
parameters. Changes in these assumptions and estimates could have an effect on the carrying amount of goodwill. A recession in
the rate of growth and operating margin would yield a lower recoverable amount. The reverse applies if the recoverable amount
were calculated based on a higher rate of growth or margin. If future cash flows are discounted at a higher interest rate, the

F1‐46


-----

recoverable amount would be lower. The reverse would apply if the recoverable amount were to rise in conjunction with
discounting at a lower discount rate.

**_Warranty provisions_**

In Assemblin Financing, warranty provisions are made for the warranty obligations found in the installation assignments being
performed. A warranty expenditure arises in a project when a Group company performs additional work as a result of
shortcomings that emerged in the original contract, in work performed or in materials. A warranty reserve is calculated based on
the probable costs of correcting the faults that arose in the contract. The scope of the warranty provision is established based on:

(a) previous experiences in similar projects;
(b) the anticipated scope of the extra work; and
(c) the estimated cost.

**_Onerous contract_**

When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is immediately recognized as an
expense in its entirety. An onerous contract is a contract in which the unavoidable costs for meeting the obligations under the
contract exceed the anticipated financial benefits. The expected loss is immediately recognized as a cost in its entirety.

###### Note 31 – Related parties

**Relationship with related parties**

The parent company has a related party relationship with its subsidiaries and the holdings in the subsidiaries are presented in
Note 30.

There are no shareholder loans to the parent company during 2022 or 2021 and hence no interest related to such shareholder
loans. Neither there is no dividend to the parent company during 2022 or 2021.

###### Note 32 – Subsequent events 

**Change in ownership, refinancing and new board**

On 3 May 2023, the newly formed company Assemblin Caverion Group AB acquired Assemblin Financing AB (formerly Assemblin
Group AB and Apollo Swedish Bidco AB, Corp. ID No. 559427‐2006). The acquisition was part of a major transfer of holdings from
Triton Fund IV to the newly formed Triton Fund IV Continuation Fund. In connection with the change of ownership, Assemblin
Caverion Group AB was deemed to be the acquiring party in accounting terms and hence the transaction resulted in the formation
of a new Group. As a result of the transaction, from the date of May 3 2023, Assemblin Financing AB and its subsidiaries are
consolidated in Assemblin Caverion Group AB and included in the consolidated financial reports of Assemblin Caverion Group AB.

In connection with the formation of the new group with the parent company Assemblin Caverion Group AB, a new bond was
issued in Assemblin Caverion Group AB in July 2023 and the bond in Assemblin Financing AB was repaid and swaps in Assemblin
Financing AB was settled. Hence, the financing risk in Assemblin Financing has changed during 2023.

  KPMG
      Independent Auditor’s report
         To the Board of Directors of Assemblin Caverion Group AB (publ) (formerly known as Assemblin Group AB
         (publ)), corporate identity number 559427-2006
       Report on the consolidated financial statements
       Opinion
       We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Assemblin Caverion Group AB (publ) and its subsidiaries
         (‘the Group”) for the period from 3 May to 31 December 2023. The consolidated financial statements of the Group
         are included on pages F2-1 to F2-45 in this document.
           In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements have been prepared and present fairly, in all material respects,
         the financial position of the Group as of the 31 December 2023 and their financial performance and cash flow for
         the period from 3 May to 31 December 2023 in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards, as adopted by the
        EU.
        Basis for Opinion
       We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA) and generally accepted
        auditing standards in Sweden. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's
        Responsibilities section. We are independent of the Group in accordance with professional ethics for accountants
           in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
       We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
        Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer
        The Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated
         financial statements and that they give a fair presentation in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as
        adopted by the EU. The Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer are also responsible for such internal
         control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free
         from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
           In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer are
        responsible for the assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. They disclose, as applicable,
        matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis of
        accounting is however not applied if the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer intends to liquidate the
         Group, to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
        Auditor’s responsibility
        Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole
         are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes
         our opinions. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted
           in accordance with ISAs and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect a material
      misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually
          or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the
        basis of these consolidated financial statements.
        As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional
        skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

         — Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
             due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit
            evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. The risk of not detecting a
             material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve
              collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentation, or the override of internal control.
        — Obtain an understanding of the Group’s internal control relevant to our audit in order to design audit
            procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on
             the effectiveness of the internal control.
        — Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
             and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer.
        — Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ and the Chief Executive Officer’s use of the
            going concern basis of accounting in preparing the consolidated financial statements. We also draw a
             conclusion, based on the audit evidence obtained, as to whether any material uncertainty exists related to
            events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
                   If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report
                to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate,
               to modify our opinion about the consolidated financial statements. Our conclusions are based on the audit
            evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause
                a Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
         — Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including
              the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions
             and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
         — Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or
            business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We
             are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely
            responsible for our opinions.
       We must inform the Board of Directors of, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit. We
        must also inform of significant audit findings during our audit, including any significant deficiencies in internal control
         that we identified.

###### Note 1 – Material accounting policies

**General information**

On 3 May 2023, the newly formed company Assemblin Caverion Group AB (formerly Assemblin Group AB and Apollo Swedish
Bidco AB, Corp. ID No. 559427‐2006) acquired Assemblin Financing AB (formerly Assemblin Group AB, Corp. ID No. 559077‐
5952). The acquisition was part of a major transfer of holdings from Triton Fund IV to the newly formed Triton Fund IV
Continuation Fund. In connection with the change of ownership, Assemblin Caverion Group AB was deemed to be the acquiring
party in accounting terms and hence the transaction resulted in the formation of a new Group. Consequently, the consolidated
financial statements of Assemblin Caverion Group AB cover the period 3 May to 31 December 2023 without comparison data.

**Basis of preparation**

These consolidated financial statements for the period 3 May 2023 to 31 December 2023 have been prepared for a purpose of
inclusion in an offering memorandum, since the parent company Assemblin Caverion Group AB (formerly Assemblin Group AB)
intend to issue a bond that is planned to be listed on The International Stock Exchange. The consolidated financial statements of
Assemblin Caverion Group (“the Group”) include Assemblin Caverion Group AB (publ) (Corp. ID No. 559427‐2006) and its
subsidiaries. A complete register of the entities that constitute the Group is presented in the consolidated financial statements,
see Note 29.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards and the interpretations
of the IFRS Interpretations Committee as adopted by the EU.

**Statement of compliance**

The consolidated financial statements for the period 3 May 2023 to 31 December 2023 were approved for issue by the Board of
Directors on 29 May 2024.

**Valuation criteria**

Assets and liabilities are recognized at historical cost, except for certain financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair
value. Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value consist of unlisted shares and participations, contingent consideration
as well as derivatives.

**Functional currency and reporting currency**

The parent company’s functional currency is the Swedish krona, which also constitutes the reporting currency for the Group. This
means that the financial statements are presented in Swedish kronor. Unless otherwise indicated, all amounts in the Annual
Report are rounded to the nearest million Swedish kronor (SEK million), which can result in a rounding difference.

**Amended accounting policies attributable to new or amended IFRS**

The amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements aims to increase the usefulness of disclosures regarding the
accounting principles applied by encouraging only material principles to be described and that such descriptions explain how the
principles are applied. Accordingly, the description of the accounting principles has concentrated more on material principles and
focused more on the application of these principles.

The Group has applied the amended IAS 12 and disclosures regarding global minimum tax can be found in Note 10 Tax.

**Operating segments**

Operating segments are reported in accordance with the internal reporting to Group Management (the highest executive decision‐
maker). Group management is responsible for allocating resources to the operating segments and evaluating their financial
performance and is also the body that makes strategic decisions. The Group’s operating segments are Assemblin Electrical,
Assemblin H&S (Heating & Sanitation), Assemblin Ventilation, Assemblin Norway and Assemblin Finland. Refer to Note 3 for
additional descriptions and presentations of the operating segments.

**Consolidation principles and business combinations**

Subsidiaries are companies over which the Group exerts a controlling interest. A controlling influence exists when the Group is
exposed to or is entitled to variable returns from its holdings in the company and can affect the return through its controlling
influence over the Company. Contingent considerations are measured at fair value at the acquisition date. In cases where the
contingent consideration is classified as an equity instrument, no restatement is performed and settlement is made within equity.

F2‐7


-----

Other contingent considerations recognised as liabilities are restated as per each reporting date, with the change being recognised
in profit/loss for the period.

**Joint ventures**

In the accounts, joint ventures are those companies for which the Group, through partnership agreements with one or more
parties, has a joint controlling interest in which the Group has the right to net assets instead of a direct right to assets and
commitments in liabilities. Holdings in joint ventures are consolidated in the financial statements in accordance with the equity
method.

**_Equity method_**

The equity method means that in the Group, the carrying amount of the shares in joint ventures corresponds to the Group’s share
of equity in joint ventures. The Group’s participation in the earnings of joint ventures is recognized in profit/loss for the period.
These shares of profits constitute the primary change in the carrying amount of shares in joint ventures.

Acquisition‐related expenses that arise are included in the cost. The equity method is applied from the date on which the joint
controlling influence is obtained until the time when the joint controlling influence ceases.

**Foreign currency translation**

**_Financial statements from operations abroad_**

Assets and liabilities in the Group’s foreign operations, including goodwill and other Group‐related surpluses and deficits, are
restated from the functional currency of the foreign operations to the Group’s reporting currency at the exchange rate in effect
at each period‐end. Non‐current loans to subsidiaries designated, by the parent, as part of its net investment in the foreign
operation are treated as equity for translational purposes with the differences being recognised in comprehensive income.
Revenue and expenses in operations abroad are restated in Swedish kronor at an average rate that constituted an approximation
of the exchange rates that were in effect on the respective transaction dates. Translation differences arising in connection with
currency translations are recognised in Other comprehensive income, and are accumulated in a separate component in equity,
designated as translation reserves. When a controlling influence or joint controlling influence in foreign operations ceases, the
accumulated translation differences are realised through a transfer from the translation reserve in equity to profit/loss for the
period.

**Revenue**

The Group’s revenue consists primarily of revenue from construction and service assignments. Revenue recognition for
construction and service assignments take place as control is transferred to the customer. The construction assignments mean
that the Group designs and installs technical systems for electrical, heating, sanitation and ventilation in customers’ offices, arenas,
shopping centers, homes and industrial premises. The Group creates an asset over which the customer gains control in pace with
the asset being completed. This means that revenue from construction assignments is reported over time. For service assignments
such as maintenance and operational work, the customer benefits in pace with the services being performed, meaning that these
revenues are also reported over time.

**_Installation assignments_**

For fixed‐price agreements, revenue is recognized based on the assignment expenditures incurred in relation to the total
estimated assignment expenditures. Since there is a direct relationship between the expenses incurred by the Group for its
assignments and the transfer to customers of the benefits, this method is considered to accurately measure the degree to which
the performance obligation is fulfilled. Costs attributable to construction assignments are recognized in profit or loss when
incurred. Most of the Group’s construction contracts are subject to fixed‐price agreements, with variable compensation in only a
few exceptional cases. Changes to agreements related to remodeling or supplementary work are recognized to the extent they
have been agreed with the customer. Claims and incentive compensation are included in the project revenue only to the extent
that it is highly unlikely that a significant reversal of accumulated reported revenue will occur.

Payment is usually received in stages during the completion of a contracting agreement and payment is usually received before
the relevant stage commences. In some contracting assignments, however, payment is received following the relevant stage. If
the services provided by the Group exceed invoiced amounts (after deductions for any reported losses), a contractual asset is
reported. Partially invoiced amounts that have not yet been settled by the customer, and amounts held by the client are included
in Trade receivables. If invoicing exceeds the services delivered (after deduction of any reported losses), a contractual liability is
reported.

A fundamental condition for recognizing revenue over time is that the outcome can reasonably be measured against completion
of the performance obligation. If it is not reasonably possible to measure the outcome of a project reliably, the income is reported

F2‐8


-----

at the corresponding amount as the accrued expense, that is, no earnings are recognized while awaiting the determination of the
earnings. Reporting revenue in pace with completion contains a component of uncertainty. Unforeseen events sometimes occur
resulting in earnings that are higher or lower than originally expected. If circumstances change, estimates regarding revenue,
expenses or the degree of completion are revised. Increases or decreases in estimated revenue or expenses attributable to revised
estimates are reported in profit or loss in the period in which the circumstances that gave rise to the audit became known to
management.

If likely that the estimated project expenses in a contracting agreement will exceed the estimated project revenues, the expected
loss is immediately reported in its entirety as a cost. The Group’s commitment to rectify errors and deficiencies in completed
projects in accordance with normal guarantee rules is reported as a provision in the statement of financial position and as an
expense in profit or loss.

**_Service assignments_**

As regards service assignments, revenue and the appurtenant costs are recognized over time (that is, in pace with the Group
performing the service). For agreements at a fixed price, revenue is reported based on the proportion of the total agreed service
delivered during the period. This is determined based on the assignment expenditures incurred in relation to the total estimated
assignment expenditures. Since there is a direct relationship between the expenses incurred by the Group for its assignments and
the transfer to customers of the benefits, this method is considered to accurately measure the degree to which the performance
commitment is fulfilled. For contracts on a current account where the Group is entitled to compensation in relation to the value
of fulfilled commitments, revenue is reported to the extent that the Group is entitled to invoice. In cases where invoicing takes
place in arrears, a contractual asset is reported. In cases where payment is made in advance regarding service contracts, a
contractual liability is reported.

**_Significant financing components_**

The Group has no agreements according to which the time between the handover of services or contracts to the customer and
the payment from the customer exceeds one year. As a result, the Group does not adjust the transaction price for the effects of a
significant financing component.

**Financial income and expenses**

Financial income consists of interest income on invested funds, dividend income, gains on changes in value of financial assets
measured at fair value through profit or loss, and exchange rate gains.

Dividend income is recognized when the right to receive dividends has been established.

Financial expenses consist of interest charged on loans, and the effect of unwinding the present value of provisions, and exchange
rate losses.

Interest income on receivables and interest expenses on liabilities are calculated using the effective interest method. The effective
interest rate is the interest rate that makes the present value of all estimated future inflows and outflows during the expected
term equal to the carrying amount of the receivable or liability. Foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized net. Exchange
rate changes regarding operating receivables and liabilities are reported in operating profit, while exchange rate changes regarding
financial receivables and liabilities are reported in net financial items.

**Tax**

Income tax consists of current tax and deferred tax. Income tax is recognized in profit or loss, except when underlying transactions
were recognized in other comprehensive income or in equity, whereupon the appurtenant tax effect is recognized in other
comprehensive income or in equity respectively.

Current tax is tax that is to be paid or received as regards the current year, with application of the tax rates determined in fact or
in practice on the balance sheet date. Adjustment of current tax attributable to earlier periods also belongs to current tax.

Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the recognized and taxable values of assets and liabilities, as well
as on tax deficits. Deferred tax liabilities attributable to temporary differences regarding participations in subsidiaries are not
reported in cases where Assemblin Caverion Group can control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is
unlikely that they will be reversed within the foreseeable future. Measurement of deferred tax is based on how the underlying
assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. Deferred tax is calculated applying tax rates and tax regulations
determined, or essentially determined, as of the balance sheet date and that are expected to apply when the relevant deferred
tax asset is realized or the deferred tax liability is settled.

F2‐9


-----

Deferred tax assets are reported if it is likely that these will be utilized against future taxable surpluses. The value of deferred tax
assets is reduced when it is no longer deemed likely that they can be utilized.

Any future income tax that arises in connection with a dividend is reported on the same date as when the dividend is recognized
as a liability.

**Financial assets and financial liabilities: Financial instruments**

**_Classification of financial assets_**

The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories:

– financial assets reported at amortized cost, and
– financial assets reported at fair value either via the income statement or via other comprehensive income.

The classification is attributable to the Group’s business model for managing financial assets and the contractual terms of the
assets’ cash flows. Financial assets are only reclassified in cases where the Group’s business model for the instruments changes.
A summary of the classifications of the Group’s financial instruments is presented in Note 20.

**_Subsequent measurement of financial assets_**

Subsequent measurement depends on the Group’s business model for managing of the asset and the type of cash flows to which
the asset gives.

_Amortized cost_

Assets held with the purpose of collecting contractual cash flows where such cash flows solely comprise principal and interest, are
reported at amortized cost, applying the effective interest method. Impairment losses are reported on the Cost of production line
in income statement. All of the Group’s financial assets, except for holdings of unlisted shares and participations and derivatives,
are measured at amortized cost.

_Fair value through other comprehensive income_

The Group measures holdings of unlisted shares and participations at fair value through other comprehensive income. No
subsequent reclassification of fair value changes is made in profit or loss when the instrument is removed from the statement of
financial position. Impairment losses (and reversals of impairment losses) are not reported separately from other changes in fair
value. Dividends are reported in profit or loss as financial income when the Group’s right to receive payment has been determined.

Derivatives with a positive fair value are recognized as derivative assets; refer further to “Hedge accounting”.

**_Derivatives and hedge accounting_**

The Group holds financial derivatives to hedge transactions foreign currency. Derivatives are recognized in the statement of
financial position as per the transaction date and measured at fair value, both initially and on subsequent remeasurement at the
end of each reporting period. The method of recognizing the gain or loss arising on remeasurement depends on whether the
derivative is recognized as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.

The Group identifies derivatives as hedges of certain risks attributable to the cash flow from a recognized asset, liability or highly
likely projected transaction (cash flow hedging).

On entering into the transaction, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item,
as well as the Group’s risk management objectives and risk management strategy regarding the hedging. The Group also
documents its assessment, both on entering into the hedge and thereafter, of whether the derivative instruments used in hedging
transactions have been, and will continue to be, effective in counteracting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the
hedged items.

Information on the fair value of derivative instruments used for hedging purposes can be found in Note 18. The fair value of a
derivative that is a hedging instrument is classified as a non‐current asset or non‐current liability when the remaining term of the
hedged item exceeds 12 months, and as a current asset or current liability when the outstanding term of the hedged item is less
than 12 months.

**_Derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting_**

All of the Group’s derivatives meet the requirements for hedge accounting.

F2‐10


-----

**_Cash flow hedges_**

When a derivative is identified as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the derivative
is recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedge reserve in equity. The effective portion of the changes
in fair value in the derivative recognized in other comprehensive income is limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the
hedged item, determined on a present value basis, from the start of the hedge. Ineffective portions of changes in fair value in the
derivative are recognized immediately in earnings.

For the hedged forecast transactions, the accumulated amount in the hedge reserve is reclassified to earnings in the same
period(s) that the hedged anticipated cash flow impacts earnings.

If the hedged cash flow is no longer expected to arise, the amount that has accumulated in the hedge reserve is immediately
reclassified to earnings.

**_Classification and subsequent measurement of financial liabilities_**

All financial liabilities except derivatives and contingent purchase considerations, are recognized at amortized cost.

**_Impairment of financial assets_**

Financial assets reported at amortized cost and subject to impairment relate mainly to accounts receivable and contractual assets.
The Group applies the simplified method when calculating expected credit losses.

The simplification means that reserves are set aside for an amount corresponding to expected credit losses during the entire term
of the receivable. The reserve is taken into account on initial recognition and is then revalued during the term of the receivable.

Contractual assets are attributable to work that has not yet been invoiced and bear essentially the same risk characteristics as
work invoiced for the same type of contract. The Group therefore considers that the loss levels for accounts receivable are a
reasonable estimate of the loss levels for contractual assets.

Calculation of expected credit losses is primarily based on information about historical losses for similar receivables and
counterparties. Historical losses are then adjusted to take into account current and forward‐looking information that may affect
customers’ ability to pay the claim.

**_Write off_**

The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when the Group has no reasonable expectation of recovering the
financial asset either entirely or in part. Before writing it off, the Group assesses each asset individually on the basis of the specific
customer. The Group expects no significant recovery of the amounts written off. Financial assets that have been written off may
nonetheless remain subject to enforcement measures to comply with the Group’s procedures for the recovery of past‐due
amounts.

**Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are recognized in the Group at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment. The cost
includes the purchase price and expenditures directly attributable to the asset for bringing it on site and in usable condition in
accordance with the purpose for which it was procured.

**_Additional expenses_**

Subsequent expenditures are added to the cost only if it is likely that the future economic benefits associated with the asset will
flow to the company and if the cost can be reliably calculated. All other subsequent expenditures are recognized as costs in the
period they arise. A subsequent expenditure is added to the cost if the expenditure relates to the replacement of identified
components or parts thereof. Even in cases where new components are created, the expenditure is added to the cost. Any
unimpaired carrying amounts on replaced components or parts of components are disposed of and expensed conjunction with
replacement. Repairs are expensed on a running basis.

**_Depreciation policies_**

Depreciation occurs on a straight‐line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset; land is not impaired.

_Estimated useful life:_

— machinery and other technical assets, 5–12 years
— furniture, tools, fixtures and fittings 5–10 years
— expenses for improvements to the property of others are depreciated across the term of the contract

F2‐11


-----

The depreciation methods applied, residual values and useful lives are reassessed at the end of every year.

**_Leased assets_**

When an agreement is signed, the Group judges whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if
it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Group mainly
leases premises and vehicles. Leases are recognized as rights of use and a corresponding liability as of the date the leased asset is
available for use by the Group. The lease liability is initially reported at the present value of the remaining lease fees during the
term of the lease, amounts expected to be paid out in accordance with any residual value guarantees, the price of call options if
the Group expects these to be exercised and any penalties for terminating an agreement if the Group deems it reasonable that
the agreement will be terminated. Lease expenses include fixed expenses and variable lease payments that depend on an index
or a rate. Agreements can contain both lease and non‐lease components. Payments for non‐lease components have been excluded
from the calculation of the lease liability. The right‐of‐use asset is initially measured at cost, which consists of the initial value of
the lease liability plus lease expenses paid on or before the commencement date and any initial direct expenses. The right‐of‐use
asset is depreciated on a straight‐line basis from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the asset
and the end of the lease term, which, for the Group, is normally the end of the leasing period. In the rarer cases, in which the cost
of the right‐of‐use asset reflects the Group exercising an option to purchase the underlying asset, the asset is depreciated until
the end of its useful life.

The term of the lease comprises the agreement’s non‐cancellable period, with the addition of further periods in the contract if,
on the commencement date, it is deemed reasonably certain that these will be exercised. When the lease’s length is determined,
all available information is taken into account that provides a financial incentive to use an extension option, or to not use an option
to terminate an agreement. Opportunities to extend an agreement are only included in the length of the leasing agreement if it is
reasonably certain that the agreement will be extended (or not terminated). Most of the extension options relating to the leasing
of premises and vehicles have not been included in the lease liability as the Group can replace the assets without significant
expenses or interruptions in operations and does not consider that it is reasonably certain that the options will be exercised.

The values of the liability and the asset are adjusted in conjunction with a reassessment of the lease term. This occurs in
conjunction with the passing of the final cancellation date in a previously assessed lease term, or alternately when significant
events take place or when circumstances have changed significantly within the control of the Group and impact the existing
assessment of the lease term.

Lease payments have been discounted by the incremental borrowing rate as regards leased premises, and by the implicit interest
rate as regards vehicles. To determine the marginal lending rate, if possible, financing recently received by a third party is used as
a starting point. If no loans from third parties exist in the near future, a method is used that is based on a risk‐free interest rate
that is adjusted for credit risk. Adjustments are made for the specific terms of the agreement, e.g. term of the lease, country and
currency.

The Group is exposed to any future increases of variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate that are not included
in the lease liability before they enter force. When adjustments of lease payments that depend on an index or a rate enter force,
the lease liability is restated against the right‐of‐use asset.

Lease payments are divided between repayment of the liability and interest. Interest is recognized in the statement of earnings
and the statement of comprehensive income over the term of the lease. Right of use assets are normally depreciated on a straight‐
line basis over the shorter of the useful life and the lease term. Payments for agreements of less than one year and low‐value
leases are expensed on a straight‐line basis in the statement of earnings and the statement of comprehensive income.

**Intangible assets**

**_Goodwill_**

Goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment. Goodwill arising from business combinations is allocated to cash‐
generating units or groups of units that are expected to benefit from the business combination. Goodwill is tested for impairment
annually or more frequently if events or altered circumstances indicate a possible impairment. Each unit or group of units to which
goodwill has been allocated corresponds to the lowest level in the Group at which the goodwill in question is monitored in the
internal control, which, for the Group, is the operating segment level.

**_Other intangible assets_**

Other intangible assets include the order backlog, brands and capitalized development expenses. Other intangible assets, with the
exception of brands, are recognized at cost less accumulated amortization (see below) and any impairment. Brands are judged to
have an indefinite useful life.

F2‐12


-----

Brands are tested for impairment annually and as soon as there are any indication that the asset in question having decreased in
value.

**_Amortization policies_**

Amortization is recognized on a straight‐line basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets, provided that such
useful lives are not indefinite. The useful lives are reviewed at least yearly. Goodwill and other intangible assets that are not yet
ready for use, are reviewed for impairment requirements on a yearly basis and additionally as soon as indications arise showing
that the asset in question has decreased in value. Intangible assets with determinate useful lives are amortized from the date they
are available for use.

_The estimated useful lives are:_

— order backlog 1–2 years
— capitalized development expenditure 3–5 years

**Impairment of non‐financial assets**

The Group’s recognized assets are assessed on every balance sheet date to determine if there are indicators of impairment
requirements.

If there is an indicator of impairment, the recoverable amount of the asset is calculated (see below). For goodwill and brands with
indeterminate useful lives and intangible assets not yet ready for use, the recoverable amount is calculated annually. If materially
independent cash flows cannot be determined for an individual asset, and its fair value less the cost to sell cannot be used, the
assets are grouped for impairment requirements at the lowest level where it is possible to identify materially independent cash
flows; this is known as a cash‐generating unit.

An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset or cash‐generating unit (group of units) exceeds the
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less the cost to sell and value‐in‐use. In calculating value‐
in‐use, future cash flows are discounted by a discount factor that takes into account the risk‐free interest rate and the risk
associated with the specific asset.

**Earnings per share**

The calculation of earnings per share is based on the Group’s profit/loss for the period attributable to the Parent Company’s
shareholders and on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period.

**Employee benefits**

**_Post‐employment benefits_**

In defined contribution plans, the company pays fixed fees to a separate legal entity, and has no obligation to pay additional fees.
The Group’s earnings are expensed for costs in pace with the benefits being vested.

Defined‐benefit plans are other plans for post‐employment benefits than defined‐contribution plans. The Group’s net obligation
regarding defined‐benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan through an estimate of the future benefits the employee
has earned through their employment in both current and previous periods. The Group bears the risk for the plan providing the
benefits offered.

In the statement of financial position, the estimated present value of the liabilities is reported as a provision as the Group only
has unfunded pension plans.

The pension cost and pension obligation for defined‐benefit pension plans are calculated annually by independent actuaries. The
discount rate corresponds to the interest rate as per the balance‐sheet date on mortgage bonds, with a tenor that corresponds to
the Group’s pension obligations. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. Net
interest expenses on the defined‐benefit obligation are recognized in the profit or loss under net financial items. The interest rate
is the interest rate that arises when discounting the obligation. Other components are recognized in operating profit. Revaluation
effects consist of actuarial gains and losses. The effects of remeasurement are recognized in other comprehensive income.

The special employer’s contributions constitute a part of the actuarial assumptions and are therefore recognized as part of the
obligation. For reasons of simplification, the part of the special employer’s contribution in a legal entity that is calculated based
on the Pension Obligations Vesting Act is recognized as an accrued cost instead of as a part of the net obligation.

F2‐13


-----

Tax on returns is recognized on an ongoing basis in the income statement for the period the tax relates to, and is therefore not
included in the liability calculation.

**Inventories**

Inventories are stated at cost or net realizable value, whichever is lower. Cost is calculated according to the first‐in‐first‐out
principle.

**Provisions**

A provision is distinguished from other liabilities in that there is uncertainty around the payment date or the amount to settle the
provision. A provision is recognized in the statement of financial position when there is a legal or informal obligation, as a result
of an event that has occurred, it is probable that an outflow of financial resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the
amount can be reliably estimated.

Provisions are made with the amount that is the best estimation of what will be required to settle the existing obligation the
balance‐sheet date. Where the effect of the timing of the payment is substantial, provisions are calculated through discounting
the anticipated future cash flow at an interest rate before tax that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of
the money and, if appropriate, the risks associated with the liability.

**_Warranties_**

Warranty provisions are reported for warranty commitments under which Assemblin Caverion Group is obliged to remedy any
deficiencies in work performed or materials used within a certain time frame following the completion of the work. The provision
is based on historical warranty data and a comparison of potential outcomes in relation to the likelihoods associated with each
outcome.

**_Restructuring_**

A provision for restructuring is recognized when there is an established, detailed and formal restructuring plan and the
restructuring has either begun or been publicly announced. No provision is made for future operating costs.

**_Onerous leases_**

A provision for onerous leases is recognized when the anticipated benefits that the Group expects to receive from a contract are
lower than the inevitable costs for fulfilling the obligations under the contract. When assessing whether a feared loss exists,
estimated project revenues are compared with the estimated project expenditures.

Estimated project expenses include:

– Expenditure directly related to the individual assignment,
– Indirect expenditure that can be allocated to the individual assignment, and
– Other expenses that, in accordance with the agreement, can be charged to the customer.

Expenses that cannot be attributed to individual assignments are not included in project expenses. Such expenses include:

– General administrative expenses, except in cases where compensation for these is to be paid in accordance with the
agreement
– Sales expenses
– Research and development expenses, except in cases where compensation for these is to be paid in accordance with the
agreement
– Depreciation of machinery and equipment not used on the project.

**Contingent liabilities**

Fulfilment warranties in the form of Parent Company warranties normally comprise 10 percent of the contract sum until the
contract has been handed over to the customer. The handover normally takes place in connection with a final inspection, on
approval. If the warranty covers all or most of the contract sum, the amount of the contingency is calculated as the contract sum
less the value of the portion performed. In cases where the warranty covers only a smaller part of the contract sum, the amount
of the guarantee is carried as an unchanged amount up until the contract is surrendered to the client. These contingent liabilities
are disclosed for the Parent Company.

In cases where a bank or insurance institution issues a completion guarantee to a customer in connection with a contract, these
normally receive, in turn, a counter‐commitment from the contracting company or another Group company. Such counter

F2‐14


-----

obligations relating to own contracts are not recognized as contingencies, since they contain no increased responsibility compared
with the contract commitment.

###### Note 3 – Operating segments

The Group’s operating segments are based primarily on the main operational orientation the segments have. The following five
operating segments have been identified:

— Assemblin Electrical — offers comprehensive solutions for planning, installation, service and maintenance in electricity and
automation. The operations also cover services in security and industrial servicing. A portion of production takes place in the
company’s proprietary electrical power stations.
— Assemblin H&S — designs, installs and maintains technical systems for heating, sanitation, sprinklers, industry, energy and
cooling in all types of buildings.
— Assemblin Ventilation — specialists in construction, installation, service and maintenance of energy‐smart ventilation
facilities.
— Assemblin Norway — possesses a high degree of competency in primarily electrical, heating and sanitation, and automation.
— Assemblin Finland — operations offer services in electricity, ventilation, heating and sanitation, and in automation and energy
efficiency as well.

These segments are the primary divisions that the company’s chief operating decision makers (Group Management) observe in
terms of earnings, capital requirements and cash flows. The company´s Group Management evaluates the segments’ results on
adjusted EBITA.

Each operating segment has a director who is responsible for the operating activities and reports the outcome from the segment
to Group Management.

The earnings, assets and liabilities of the operating segments have included directly attributable items, as well as items that can
reasonably and reliably be allocated to the segments. The internal price among the Group’s various segments is set under the
“arm’s length” principle (i.e. between parties that are independent of each other, well‐informed and with a shared interest in
performing the transactions).

**Overview of defined‐benefit plans**

The Group has a defined‐benefit plan that provides remuneration to employees when they retire. The plan relates only to
Sweden. The defined‐benefit plan is exposed to actuarial risks such as life expectancy, currency, interest rate and investment
risks. Disbursements to plans are expected to total SEK 18.7 million over the next few years. The defined‐benefit plan is primarily
attributable to men.

**_Assumptions for defined‐benefit obligations_** 2023

Discount rate as of 31 December 3.30%

Future salary growth 2.20%

Inflation 1.70%

The life expectancy assumption is based on published statistics and mortality rates. The current life expectancy on which the
obligation is calculated is based on DUS21. The remaining life expectancy for a 65‐year‐old woman with this life expectancy
assumption is 23.9 years and 21.8 years for a man. The total duration of the obligation is 16 years to establish a discount rate of
3.30 percent.

F2‐20


-----

**Sensitivity analysis**

The table below presents possible changes to actuarial assumptions as at the period end, other assumptions unchanged, and how
these would affect the defined‐benefit obligation.

_Change in the assumptions regarding 2023_ Increase Decrease

Discount rate (0.5% change) ‐7.5% 8.3%

Expected mortality (1 year change) 3.4% ‐3.4%

Future salary growth (0.5% change) 4.2% ‐3.7%

Increase/decrease in inflation (0.5% change) 6.1% ‐5.6%

**Alecta**

For salaried employees in Sweden, the defined‐benefit pension obligations in the ITP‐2 plan for retirement and family pensions
are secured through insurance with Alecta. According to a statement from the Swedish Financial Reporting Board, this is a defined‐
benefit plan that covers several employees. For the financial year, the company did not have access to such information as would
make it possible to recognise this plan as a defined‐benefit plan. The pension plan under ITP secured through insurance with Alecta
is thus recognised as a defined‐contribution plan.

The premium at Alecta is calculated individually and is based on such factors as salary, previously vested pension and expected
remaining length of service. Anticipated ITP 2 fees for Alecta over the coming year total SEK 45.9 million. The Group’s share of the
total fees for the pension system is 0.09 percent, while its share of the total number of active members in the system is 0.06
percent.

Annual fees for pension insurance contracted with Alecta totals SEK 56.4 million. The consolidation level shall normally be
permitted to vary between 125 and 175 percent. In the event Alecta’s consolidated funding level is less than 125 percent or
exceeds 175 percent, measures are to be taken to return to the normal range. In the event of low consolidation levels, one
measure could be raising the contracted price for new policies and expanding existing benefits. In the event of high consolidation
levels, one measure could be a premium reduction. The premiums paid to Alecta are calculated applying assumptions regarding
interest rates, life expectancy, operating costs and tax on returns from pension funds, so that the payment of a consistent premium
amount until the day when the pension is sufficient to ensure that the entire targeted benefit, based on the insured current
pensionable salary, is actually earned. The collective consolidation level consists of the market value of Alecta’s actuarial
calculations, which do not correspond with IAS 19. At year‐end, 157 percent of Alecta’s surplus in the form of the collective
consolidation level amounted to 172 percent.

**Pillar II**

Pillar II legislation has been adopted in some jurisdictions where the Group operates. The legislation came into effect for the
financial year commencing 1 January 2024. The Group, excluding the companies within Caverion Group, has assessed its potential
exposure regarding income taxes under the new legislation.

This assessment is based on the latest available information regarding the financial performance of the units within the current
group structure as of 31 December, 2023. Based on the assessment made, the effective tax rates within Pillar II in all jurisdictions
where the Group (excluding the Caverion Group) operates are above 15 percent and management is not currently aware of any
circumstances under which this may change. The Group does not therefore expect any potential exposure to additional taxes
within Pillar II. For the current group structure as of 31 December, 2023. Assessment regarding potential exposure for “top‐up”
taxes in jurisdictions where Caverion Group operates due to effect tax rates potentially below 15 percent is ongoing.

###### Note 13 – Business combinations

**Acquisition of Assemblin Financing**

On 3 May, 2023, Assemblin Caverion Group AB (formerly Assemblin Group AB and Apollo Swedish Bidco AB, Corp. ID No. 559427‐
2006) acquired Assemblin Financing AB (formerly Assemblin Group AB, Corp. ID No. 559077‐ 5952). The acquisition was part of a
major transfer of holdings from Triton Fund IV to the newly formed Triton Fund IV Continuation Fund as the ultimate shareholder.
The change in ownership resulted in the formation of a new Group in which the highest consolidating Parent Company is Assemblin
Caverion Group AB (Corp. ID No. 559427‐2006). The purchase consideration amounted to SEK 5,885 million. Before that, the
Company obtained a shareholder contribution of SEK 4,467 million. The acquisition of Assemblin Financing AB was financed with
this shareholder contributions and with loans. Since no actual outgoing or incoming payments have occurred, these amounts are
not reported in the investing or financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flow. In connection with the change of
ownership, Assemblin Caverion Group AB was deemed to be the acquiring party in accounting terms and hence the transaction
resulted in the formation of a new Group.

As of 31 December 2023, conditional purchase considerations are assessed for each acquired unit based on the terms of the
acquisition agreement – calculations are based on historical outcomes, forecasts and budgets and, where applicable, acquisition
forecasts or business plans (for the term exceeding that budgeted). In those cases where the recorded outcome no longer appears
achievable (given historical outcomes and existing conditions) individual contingent purchase considerations are reassessed at a
level corresponding to that budgeted or, if there is specific budgetary uncertainty due to restructuring or market development,
for example, at a level corresponding to a scenario assessed as likely.

Capitalized development costs are internally generated intangibles.

**Impairment testing of cash generating units containing goodwill and other intangible assets**

Assessing the value of the Group’s goodwill items and other intangible assets occurs annually based on the value‐in‐use of the
cash‐generating units. The value‐in‐use for the respective units is based on a forecast of future cash flows. These are based on the
2024 budget and subsequently on the business area‐specific assumptions of yearly sales growth, EBITA margin and working capital
requirements for the period from 2025 to 2027. These assumptions are set based on the history of the operations, the objectives
in the business plan, the competitiveness of the operations and an assessment of future trends in the business cycle. Annual
growth for the period after 2027 is assumed to be 2.0 percent. The forecast cash flows have been calculated at their present value
with discount rates before tax amounting to 11.0 percent in Sweden, 11.7 percent in Norway and 11.5 percent in Finland based
on a weighted average of the Company’s cost for externally borrowed capital and a theoretical yield requirement on equity. As of
31 December 2023, the value‐in‐use exceeds the carrying amount for all units tested. There is thus no impairment requirement,
and no reasonable changes in the material assumptions would give rise to impairment.

###### Note 18 – Financial risks and risk management

Through its operations, the Group is exposed to various types of financial risks.

— Liquidity risk
— Refinancing risk
— Currency risk

F2‐29


-----

— Interest rate risk
— Credit risk

**Framework for financial risk management**

Responsibility for the Group’s financial transactions and risks is managed centrally by the Group’s treasury function, which is part
of the Assemblin Sweden subsidiary. The overall objective for the treasury function is to provide cost‐effective financing and to
minimise negative effects on the Group’s earnings arising from financial risks.

**Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group cannot meet its immediate payment obligations. To ensure this, the Group has
measures including a three‐month liquidity plan covering all of the Group’s units. There is also a routine for continually ensuring
the holding of suitable credit facilities.

**Maturity structure, financial liabilities – undiscounted cash flows**

Cash and cash equivalents available 589 ‐ 589

Liquidity reserve 2,364 410 1,953

**Refinancing risk**

Refinancing risk related to the risk that the Group does not have sufficient funds available when these are needed to refinance
loans that fall due, or that the Group encounters difficulties in obtaining new facilities at a given point in time. Ensuring these
needs requires both a strong financial position and active measures to ensure access to credits. The refinancing risk is managed
through such measures as long‐term borrowing.

**Currency risk**

Currency risk means the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates will have a negative impact on profit or loss, the statement of
financial position and cash flows. Currency risk can be divided into transaction exposure and translation exposure. Transaction
exposure consists of the net of operating and finance in and outflows in currencies. The Group’s EUR financing is hedged with a
derivative that eliminates the currency risk as regards interest payments and capital liability for which hedge accounting is applied.
Translation exposure consists of the net assets of the Norwegian and Finnish subsidiaries, and their earnings in foreign currencies.

F2‐30


-----

_Sensitivity analysis — currency risk (translation exposure)_

An increase of five per cent in the EUR/SEK exchange rate would negatively impact the Group’s equity by SEK ‐3 million, while a
similar increase in the NOK/SEK exchange rate would positively impact equity by SEK +3 million. The Group’s profit before tax
would be affected by SEK ‐1 million and SEK +1 million, respectively, in the same exchange rate change.

**Interest rate risk**

Interest rate risk means the risk that interest income is negatively affected or that the value of financial instruments varies due to
changes in market interest rates, which can lead to changes in fair values and changes in cash flows. Exposures arise primarily as
a consequence of the Group’s external interest‐bearing borrowings.

_Sensitivity analysis — interest rate risk_

The impact of an interest rate hike of 1 percentage point at the balance sheet date on interest revenue and interest expenses
during the coming twelve‐month period would total SEK 51 million, given the interest‐bearing assets and liabilities existing on the
balance‐sheet date.

**Effect of hedge accounting**

**Credit risk**

_Credit risks in finance operations_

Financial credit risk arises when cash and cash equivalents are invested, and in conjunction with trading in financial instruments.
These are primarily counterparty risks in connection with receivables in banks and other counterparties that arise when purchasing
derivative financial instruments. There are no receivables in counterparties regarding derivatives as of 31 December 2023. For
other financial assets, the credit risk is assumed to correspond to the carrying amounts.

_Credit risks in trade receivables_

The risk that the Group’s or company’s customers cannot fulfil their commitments (i.e. payment is not received from customers)
constitutes a customer credit risk. The Group’s customers are subject to credit checks, in which information about the customers’
financial position is obtained from various credit bureaus. The Group has prepared a credit policy for how customer credits are to
be managed. It indicates, for example, where decisions are made on credit limits of various sizes, and how credits and doubtful
receivables are to be managed. No individual customer represents 10 per cent of sales. The Groups companies have historically
had low credit losses, and there are no indications that this will change. For the purpose of assessing the risk in trade receivables,
they are divided into various risks depending on how many days have passed since the due date. Invoices are routinely sent over
the course of the project and in advance. Trade receivables are additionally divided among a great many customers in various
industries and have a broad geographical spread.

###### Note 20 – Measuring financial assets and liabilities at fair value

Measurement at fair value contains a measurement hierarchy regarding input data for the valuations. This measurement hierarchy
is divided into three levels corresponding with the levels introduced in IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.

**_The three levels consist of:_**

Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has access to on the
measurement date.

Level 2: Inputs other than the quoted prices included in Level 1, which are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability.
This can also relate to inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, such as interest rate levels,
yield curves, volatility and multiples.

F2‐32


-----

Level 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. At this level, the assumptions that market participants would make use of
in pricing the asset or liability, including risk assumptions, must be taken into consideration.

**_Classification of fair value_**

Derivatives are valued in accordance with level 2. Fair value adjustments are reported in the hedge reserve. The Group’s
derivatives consist of currency interest rate swaps whose fair value is determined by discounting the future cash flows attributable
to the instruments. Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income pertain primarily to Elajo and
classed in accordance with Level 3 since they are not listed on a regulated market and no observable transactions have occurred
in the near term. The holdings are recognised through other comprehensive income. Contingent purchase considerations are
reported in accordance with level 3. For all other items, excluding borrowings, the carrying amount is an approximation of the fair
value. Accordingly, these items are not divided into levels under the measurement hierarchy.

Since borrowing via bond loans run with variable interest rates, their carrying amount is also deemed to essentially correspond to
the fair values. For all financial instruments in the Parent Company, the carrying amount is considered to be a reasonable
approximation of fair value.

Historically, Assemblin and its subsidiaries have had low confirmed customer losses and this is not deemed to have changed in
2024 or to do so in the future. When assessing expected credit losses, the receivables are classified in accordance with the
number of days due. The Group’s major customers are credit tested via credit information companies and the subsidiaries
monitor cancelled and late payments closely. The Group invoices customers on an ongoing basis over the production period,

F2‐33

with any credit losses being detected at an early stage. Advance invoicing is also applied in cases where this is deemed necessary
or requested. Accounts receivable are based on a large number of customers and projects in various industries and geographical
areas. The contractual assets amount to SEK 651 million and relate to accrued but not invoiced income and are by nature
comparable to accounts receivable. In light of Assemblin Caverion Group’s historically low credit losses, the impact from the
impairment model in accordance with IFRS 9 is considered to be insignificant.

Trade receivables are recognised after taking customer losses totalling SEK 12 million in the Group into account.

**Guarantee commitments**

Provisions for warranties relate to assumed future expenditures for rectifying future errors and shortcomings regarding concluded
projects that arise during the warranty period for the projects. The provisions are primarily attributable to projects concluded in
2022 and 2023 whose warranty period is up to five years. The provisions are based on calculations of historical warranty expenses
and known complaints. The present values of the provisions are not calculated. Further information concerning important
assessments and estimates is provided in Note 30.

**Restructuring, Onerous contracts and disputes**

Among other things, restructuring provisions consist of expenses for future settlements related to the closure of unprofitable
branches in announced restructuring programmes. In addition, the Group has several rental agreements for premises with long
notice periods that stand unused as a result of reorganisations. Provisions have been made for commitments to pay peripheral
expenses over and above rental expenses during the remainder of the contract period.

For construction contracts where it is likely that the total contract expenses will exceed total contract revenue, the anticipated
loss is immediately recognised in its entirety as a expense. An obligatory agreement is a contract where the unavoidable
expenses for meeting the obligations under the agreement exceed the anticipated financial benefits.

Provisions for disputes and other provisions are based on individual risk evaluation as per the balance sheet date and are
primarily related to acquisitions and adjustments of acquisition balances.

###### Note 30 – Critical estimates and judgements

Company management has discussed the development and choice of the Group’s critical accounting policies and estimates, the
information concerning them, and the application of these policies and estimates with the Audit Committee.

**Estimates on recognition**

Certain critical estimates are described below.

**_Recognition of revenue over time (percentage of completion)_**

The reported earnings in ongoing contract projects are recognized over time on the basis of assignment expenditures incurred in
relation to the total estimated assignment fees of the assignment. Costs associated with this are recognized in profit or loss as

F2‐39


-----

they arise. This requires reliable calculation of project revenue and project costs. The precondition is a properly functioning system
for cost accounting, forecasting processes and project monitoring. The forecast regarding the project’s final outcome is a critical
judgement that is material to the operating report over the course of the project. There may be a risk that the final result as
regards the project could deviate from what is recognized over time.

**_Pensions_**

Assemblin has defined‐benefit pension plans. The pension obligations are calculated using actuarial assumptions, as of the balance
sheet date, the present value of the obligations is reported. A change in any of these assumptions and measurements could have
a significant impact on calculated pension commitments and pension costs.

**_Intangible assets_**

_Impairment testing of goodwill_

The recoverable amounts of cash‐generating units are based on the assumption of future conditions and estimates of various
parameters. Changes in these assumptions and estimates could have an effect on the carrying amount of goodwill. A recession in
the rate of growth and operating margin would yield a lower recoverable amount. The reverse applies if the recoverable amount
were calculated based on a higher rate of growth or margin. If future cash flows are discounted at a higher interest rate, the
recoverable amount would be lower. The reverse would apply if the recoverable amount were to rise in conjunction with
discounting at a lower discount rate.

**_Warranty provisions_**

In the Assemblin Caverion Group, warranty provisions are made for the warranty obligations found in the installation assignments
being performed. A warranty expenditure arises in a project when a Group company performs additional work as a result of
shortcomings that emerged in the original contract, in work performed or in materials. A warranty reserve is calculated based on
the probable costs of correcting the faults that arose in the contract. The scope of the warranty provision is established based on:

(a) previous experiences in similar projects;
(b) the anticipated scope of the extra work; and
(c) the estimated cost.

**_Onerous contract_**

When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is immediately recognized as an
expense in its entirety. An onerous contract is a contract in which the unavoidable costs for meeting the obligations under the
contract exceed the anticipated financial benefits. The expected loss is immediately recognized as a cost in its entirety.

**Acquisition of Caverion**

On 1 April 2024, Assemblin Caverion Group AB (formerly named Assemblin Group AB) acquired Crayfish HoldCo Oy, which is the
Parent Company of the Caverion Group (“Caverion acquisition"). Triton as the ultimate parent company of the Caverion Group
transferred 100% of its holding to Assemblin Caverion Group, to create a leading northern European technical and service

installation company. The aggregate consideration of SEK 10,585 million for the Caverion acquisition was funded by (i) an
unconditional shareholder contribution in an amount of SEK 4,822 million (EUR 418 million equivalent) and (ii) a shareholder loan
in the amount of SEK 5,727 (EUR 500 million equivalent). Hence, no actual outgoing or incoming payments have occurred and no
cashflow will be reported related to the Caverion acquisition. There is no purchase consideration liability related to the Caverion
acquisition. There are no acquisition costs in Assemblin Caverion Group AB related to the Caverion acquisition. The estimated
annual sales for Caverion Group based on their latest annual report is approximately EUR 2,491 million with an operating profit of
approximately EUR 77 million. The new Assemblin Caverion Group, including Caverion Group, will have about 21,900 employees
with operations in ten countries and annual sales of approximately EUR 3.8 billion (SEK 43.5 billion). In connection with the
acquisition, Assemblin Group AB changed name to Assemblin Caverion Group AB.

Assemblin Caverion Group is in the process to prepare an acquisition analysis for the recent closed Caverion acquisition. Due to
being a recent transaction initial net asset values included in the acquisition analysis are still to be finalized. Management’s best
estimate as of the date of approval of those consolidated financial statements is that changes in valuation of items in the
acquisition analysis would also affect the preliminary amount of goodwill.

The preliminary acquisition analysis for the Caverion acquisition is presented below.

###### * The group goodwill recognized in the preliminary acquisition analysis is mainly attributable to expected synergies from combining operations of the
former Assmeblin Group and Caverion Group as well as a growth agenda, a beneficial business model and a strong organizational culture. None of the
goodwill is expected to be deducted for tax purpose.

allocation relating to order back log, brand and other acquisition related intangible assets. The
estimated useful life for a large proportion of the order back log is two years and a minor proportion
of the order back log has an estimated longer useful life. Brand has an estimated indefinite useful
life.

Right of Use assets / Leasing Leases in the PPA has been remeasured by way of adjusting the long‐term lease liabilities to a value
corresponding to the recognized value of rights‐of‐use assets in Caverion Group’s condensed
consolidated statement of financial position. This is the preliminary assessment.

Deferred taxes Considered based on applicability

The following amounts have been measured on provisional basis:

   - The fair values of Caverion Group’s other intangible assets (order backlog, brand and other acquisition related intangibles) have been measured
provisionally, pending completion of independent valuation.

   - Assets such as inventory, ongoing projects and leasing related items are to be valued and the information is still assessed for completeness.
The group has conducted preliminary assessment of the provisions. Other assets and liabilities might also be subject to reassessment.

In connection with the Annual General Meeting on March 27 2024, Susanne Ekblom and Per Ingemar Persson’s term as board
members ended. Two new board members were elected, Mikael Aro and Jacob Götzsche. Jacob Götzsche was elected new
Chairman of the Board.

###### Note 34 – Alternative performance measures

This document contains alternative performance measures. These measures describe historical financial performance, but
exclude or include amounts that would not be adjusted for in the most comparable IFRS financial measure. The alternative
performance measures are used internally by management, in conjunction with IFRS financial measures, to measure
performance and make decisions regarding the future direction of the business. Management believes these alternative
performance measures, when provided in combination with reported IFRS financial measures, provide helpful supplementary
information for investors. These measures are not substitute for or superior to, and should be used in conjunction with,
reported IFRS financial measures. In addition, the alternative performance measures, as defined by Assemblin, may not be
comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on
these alternative performance measures.

       Independent Auditor’s Report on Review of Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial
       Information
         To the Board of Directors of Assemblin Financing AB (publ), corporate identity number 559077-5952
        Introduction
        We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial information of Assemblin Financing AB
         (publ) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) as of 2 May 2023, included on pages F3-1 to F3-14 in this document, which
         comprises:
                   - | The condensed consolidated statement of financial position as at 2 May 2023;
                   - the condensed consolidated statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the period 1
            January to 2 May 2023;
                   - the condensed consolidated statement of changes in equity for the period 1 January to 2 May 2023;
                  - the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the period 1 January to 2 May 2023; and
                  - notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements.
         The Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these
        condensed consolidated interim financial information in accordance with IAS 34 “Inteirm Financial Reporting”. Our
         responsibility is to express a conclusion on these condensed consolidated interim financial information based on our
         review.
       Scope of review
        We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements ISRE 2410 Review of
         Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity. A review of interim financial
         information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and
         applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
        accordance with International Standards on Auditing and other generally accepted auditing practices and consequently
         does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in
          an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
        Basis for Qualified Conclusion
         As stated in Note 1 “Accounting policies’, the condensed consolidated interim financial information is based on IAS 34
         “Interim financial reporting”, but not fully in accordance with IAS 34 due to no comparatives are presented.
       Qualified Conclusion
        Based on our review, except for the effects of the matter described in the Basis for Qualified Conclusion paragraph,
         nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed consolidated interim financial
         information as at 2 May, 2023 is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34 “Interim Financial
         Reporting’.

###### Notes

 1. Accounting policies

On 3 May, 2023, Assemblin Caverion Group AB (formerly Assemblin Group AB and Apollo Swedish Bidco AB, Corp. ID No. 559427‐
2006) acquired Assemblin Financing AB (formerly Assemblin Group AB, Corp. ID No. 559077‐ 5952). The acquisition was part of a
major transfer of holdings from Triton Fund IV to the newly formed Triton Fund IV Continuation Fund as the ultimate shareholder.
In connection with the change of ownership, Assemblin Caverion Group AB was deemed to be the acquiring party in accounting
terms and hence the transaction resulted in the formation of a new group. External consolidation reporting standards only allow
consolidated reporting from the formation of the group in May 2023. This means that the legal consolidated accounts for
Assemblin Caverion Group AB encompass the period 3 May – 31 December 2023. This condensed consolidated interim financial
information of Assemblin Financing AB is prepared for the four months period 1 January to 2 May 2023 to present the operations
within Assemblin Financing for the period prior being acquired by Assemblin Caverion Group AB.

This condensed consolidated interim financial information is based on IAS 34 “Interim financial reporting”, but not fully in
accordance with IAS 34 due to no comparatives are presented. The same accounting policies and bases for calculation have been
applied in condensed consolidated interim financial information as in the consolidated financial statements for the year 2022 and
2021. This condensed consolidated interim financial information for the interim period have been prepared for Assemblin
Financing (“the Group”) and include Assemblin Financing AB (publ) (559077‐5952) and its subsidiaries.

**Seasonality**

The operating results generally vary from quarter to quarter as a result of seasonal fluctuations. During the first quarter of the
year, sales and margins are usually lower due to reduction in production attributed to inclement weather and the large number
of public holidays (New Year, and sometimes Easter) as well as a calendar effect of more projects being completed during the
fourth quarter. However, cash flow in the first quarter is normally positively affected by the stronger earnings from the fourth
quarter.

form in the table below as they are not individually of such a size that separate reporting of each acquisition is justified.

-----

*SEK 153 million is contingent purchase consideration liabilities and SEK 1 million is fixed purchase consideration liabilities.

###### 4. Financial assets and liabilities

Shareholdings in Elajo are reported at fair value. The shares are attributed to level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because they are
not listed on a regulated market and no observable transactions have been made in the Company recently. As of 2 May 2023, fair
value amounted to SEK 30 million.

Amounts entered as liabilities that may come to be paid out to previous owners (contingent purchase considerations) amounted
to SEK 526 million as of 2 May 2023 and are classified in accordance with level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The Group’s derivatives
consist of currency interest rate swaps whose fair value is determined by discounting the future cash flows attributable to the
instruments. The amount entered as an asset amount to SEK 172 million and is classified in accordance with level 2 in the fair
value hierarchy. The fair values of the Group’s long‐term assets and liabilities do not differ significantly from the reported values.

F3‐9


-----

###### 5. Non‐current liabilities

As of 2 May 2023, non‐current liabilities included pension provisions of SEK 596 million. The present value of the pension
obligations is determined by an independent actuary applying several financial assumptions. Assumptions regarding inflation and
future wage increases have decreased since the comparison quarter, reducing the liability whilst the discount rate has increased,
resulting in a further reduction. The key assumptions for defined benefit obligations are:


2 May, 2023


Discount rate 4,00%

Wage increase 2,60%

Inflation 2,10%

###### 6. Related party transactions

No transactions have occurred between Assemblin and related parties that substantially impacted the Company’s financial
position and earnings.

###### 7. Events after the balance‐sheet date

On 3 May 2023, the newly formed company Assemblin Caverion Group AB acquired Assemblin Financing AB (formerly Assemblin
Group AB, Corp. ID No. 559077‐ 5952). The acquisition was part of a major transfer of holdings from Triton Fund IV to the newly
formed Triton Fund IV Continuation Fund. In connection with the change of ownership, Assemblin Caverion Group AB (formerly
Assemblin Group AB and Apollo Swedish Bidco AB, Corp. ID No. 559427‐2006) was deemed to be the acquiring party in
accounting terms and hence the transaction resulted in the formation of a new Group.

In connection with the formation of the new group with the parent company Assemblin Caverion Group, a new bond was issued
in Assemblin Caverion Group AB in July 2023 and the bond in Assemblin Financing AB was repaid and swaps in Assemblin
Financing AB was settled. Hence, the financing risk in Assemblin Financing has changed during 2023.

In September 2023, the previous board members of Assemblin Financing AB terminated as members of the board in Assemblin
Financing AB and instead were elected board members in Assemblin Caverion Group AB, the new parent company of the newly
formed group. The new board members elected in Assemblin Financing AB is Mats Johansson, as Chairman, Philip Carlsson and
Anders Sarpakari.

**Acquisitions and divestments in 2023**

approximately SEK 140 million. In the end of May 2023, Assemblin Ventilasjon AS in Norway acquired Ingeniørfirmaet R. Torgersen

       Independent Auditor’s Report on Review of Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial
       Statements
         To the Board of Directors of Assemblin Financing AB (publ), corporate identity number 559077-5952
        Introduction
        We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements of Assemblin Financing AB
         (publ) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) as of 31 March 2023, included on pages F4-1 to F4-13 in this document, which
         comprises:
                   - | The condensed consolidated statements of financial position as at 31 March 2023;
                   - the condensed consolidated statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the three-month
              period ended 31 March 2023;
                   - the condensed consolidated statements of changes in equity for the three-month period ended 31 March
             2023;
                  - the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the three-month period ended 31 March 2023; and
                   - notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements.
         The Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these
        condensed consolidated interim financial statements in accordance with IAS 34, “Inteirm Financial Reporting”. Our
         responsibility is to express a conclusion on these condensed consolidated interim financial statements based on our
         review.
       Scope of review
        We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements ISRE 2410 Review of
         Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity. A review of interim financial
         information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and
         applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
        accordance with International Standards on Auditing and other generally accepted auditing practices and consequently
         does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in
          an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
       Conclusion
        Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed consolidated
         interim financial statements as at 31 March, 2023 is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34
         “Interim Financial Reporting”.

###### Notes

 1. Accounting policies

These condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 “Interim financial
reporting”. The same accounting policies and bases for calculation have been applied in condensed consolidated interim financial
statements as in the consolidated financial statements for the year 2022 and 2021. These condensed consolidated interim financial
statements for the interim periods have been prepared for Assemblin Financing (“the Group”) and include Assemblin Financing
AB (publ) (559077‐5952) and its subsidiaries.

**Seasonality**

The operating results generally vary from quarter to quarter as a result of seasonal fluctuations. During the first quarter of the
year, sales and margins are usually lower due to reduction in production attributed to inclement weather and the large number
of public holidays (New Year, and sometimes Easter) as well as a calendar effect of more projects being completed during the
fourth quarter. However, cash flow in the first quarter is normally positively affected by the stronger earnings from the fourth
quarter.

###### 4. Financial assets and liabilities

Shareholdings in Elajo are reported at fair value. The shares are attributed to level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because they are
not listed on a regulated market and no observable transactions have been made in the Company recently. As of 31 March 2023,
fair value amounted to SEK 30 million and at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, fair value amounted to SEK 30 million (30).

Amounts entered as liabilities that may come to be paid out to previous owners (contingent purchase considerations) amounted
to SEK 526 million (386) as of 31 March 2023 and are classified in accordance with level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The Group’s
derivatives consist of currency interest rate swaps whose fair value is determined by discounting the future cash flows attributable
to the instruments. The amount entered as an asset amount to SEK 172 million and is classified in accordance with level 2 in the
fair value hierarchy. The issue of the bond of EUR 100 million in January 2021 were not hedged. The fair values of the Group’s
long‐term assets and liabilities do not differ significantly from the reported values.

###### 5. Non‐current liabilities

As of 31 March 2023, non‐current liabilities included pension provisions of SEK 596 million (SEK 548 million as of 31 December
2022). The present value of the pension obligations is determined by an independent actuary applying several financial
assumptions. Assumptions regarding inflation and future wage increases have decreased since the comparison quarter, reducing
the liability whilst the discount rate has increased, resulting in a further reduction. The key assumptions for defined benefit
obligations are:

31‐Mar‐2023 31‐Dec‐2022

Discount rate 4,00% 4,00%

Wage increase 2,60% 2,60%

Inflation 2,10% 2,10%

###### 6. Related party transactions

No transactions have occurred between Assemblin and related parties that substantially impacted the Company’s financial
position and earnings.

###### 7. Events after the balance‐sheet date

**Change in ownership, refinancing and new board**

On 3 May 2023, the newly formed company Assemblin Caverion Group AB acquired Assemblin Financing AB (formerly Assemblin
Group AB, Corp. ID No. 559077‐ 5952). The acquisition was part of a major transfer of holdings from Triton Fund IV to the newly
formed Triton Fund IV Continuation Fund. In connection with the change of ownership, Assemblin Caverion Group AB (formerly
Assemblin Group AB and Apollo Swedish Bidco AB, Corp. ID No. 559427‐2006) was deemed to be the acquiring party in accounting
terms and hence the transaction resulted in the formation of a new Group. As a result of the transaction, from the date of May 3
2023, Assemblin Financing AB and its subsidiaries are consolidated in Assemblin Caverion Group AB and included in the
consolidated financial reports of Assemblin Caverion Group AB.

In connection with the formation of the new group with the parent company Assemblin Caverion Group AB, a new bond was
issued in Assemblin Caverion Group AB in July 2023 and the bond in Assemblin Financing AB was repaid and swaps in Assemblin
Financing AB was settled. Hence, the financing risk in Assemblin Financing has changed during 2023.

###### 8. Alternative performance measures

This document contains alternative performance measures. These measures describe historical financial performance, but exclude
or include amounts that would not be adjusted for in the most comparable IFRS financial measure. The alternative performance
measures are used internally by management, in conjunction with IFRS financial measures, to measure performance and make
decisions regarding the future direction of the business. Management believes these alternative performance measures, when
provided in combination with reported IFRS financial measures, provide helpful supplementary information for investors. These
measures are not substitute for or superior to, and should be used in conjunction with, reported IFRS financial measures. In
addition, the alternative performance measures, as defined by Assemblin, may not be comparable to other similarly titled
measures used by other companies. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these alternative performance

      Independent Auditor’s Report on Review of Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial
       Statements
         To the Board of Directors of Assemblin Caverion Group AB (publ) (formerly know as Assemblin Group AB (publ)),
         corporate identity number 559427-2006
        Introduction
        We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements of Assemblin Caverion
        Group AB (publ) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) as of 31 March 2024, included on pages F5-1 to F5-13 in this
        document, which comprises:
                   - The condensed consolidated statements of financial position as at 31 March 2024;
                   - the condensed consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the three-month
              period ended 31 March 2024;
                   - the condensed consolidated statement of changes in equity for the three-month period ended 31 March 2024;
                  - the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the three-month period ended 31 March 2024; and
                      -. notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements.
         The Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these
        condensed consolidated interim financial statements in accordance with IAS 34 “Inteirm Financial Reporting”. Our
         responsibility is to express a conclusion on these condensed consolidated interim financial statements based on our
         review.
       Scope of review
        We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements ISRE 2410 Review of
         Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity. A review of interim financial
         information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and
         applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
        accordance with International Standards on Auditing and other generally accepted auditing practices and consequently
         does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in
          an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
       Conclusion
        Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed consolidated
         interim financial statements as at 31 March, 2024 is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34
         “Interim Financial Reporting’.

###### Notes

 1. Accounting policies

On 3 May 2023, the newly formed company Assemblin Caverion Group AB (formerly Assemblin Group AB and Apollo Swedish
Bidco AB, Corp. ID No. 559427‐2006) acquired Assemblin Financing AB (formerly Assemblin Group AB, Corp. ID No. 559077‐
5952). The acquisition was part of a major transfer of holdings from Triton Fund IV to the newly formed Triton Fund IV
Continuation Fund. In connection with the change of ownership, Assemblin Caverion Group AB was deemed to be the acquiring
party in accounting terms and hence the transaction resulted in the formation of a new Group. Consequently, the consolidated
group of Assemblin Caverion Group was established as of 3 May 2023. External consolidation reporting standards only allow
consolidated reporting from the formation of the group in May 2023. These condensed consolidated interim financial
statements do not include any comparison data for the three months period 2023 due to the Group not being established at
that time.

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 “Interim financial
reporting”. The same accounting policies and bases for calculation have been applied in this interim financial statements as in the
consolidated financial statements for the period 3 May 2023 to 31 December 2023. These condensed consolidated interim
financial statements for the interim period have been prepared for Assemblin Caverion Group AB (“the Group”) and its
subsidiaries.

**Seasonality**

The operating results generally vary from quarter to quarter as a result of seasonal fluctuations. During the first quarter of the
year, sales and margins are usually lower due to reduction in production attributed to inclement weather and the large number
of public holidays (New Year, and sometimes Easter) as well as a calendar effect of more projects being completed during the
fourth quarter. However, cash flow in the first quarter is normally positively affected by the stronger earnings from the fourth
quarter.

###### 4. Financial assets and liabilities

Shareholdings in Elajo are reported at fair value. The shares are attributed to level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because they are
not listed on a regulated market and no observable transactions have been made in the Company recently. As of 31 December
2023, fair value amounted to SEK 30 million and at the end of the first quarter of 2024, fair value amounted to SEK 30 million.

Amounts entered as liabilities that may come to be paid out to previous owners (contingent purchase considerations) amounted
to SEK 404 million as of 31 March 2024 and are classified in accordance with level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The Group’s
derivatives consist of currency interest rate swaps whose fair value is determined by discounting the future cash flows attributable
to the instruments. The amount entered as an liability amount to SEK 164 million and is classified in accordance with level 2 in the
fair value hierarchy. At the beginning of July, Assemblin Caverion Group AB issued a bond totaling EUR 480 million. Out of a total
of EUR 480 million, EUR 375 million has been hedged from EUR to SEK. The fair values of the Group's non‐current assets and
liabilities do not differ significantly from the recorded amounts.

###### 5. Non‐current liabilities

As of 31 March 2024, non‐current liabilities included pension provisions of SEK 678 million (SEK 644 million as of 31 December
2023). The present value of the pension obligations is determined by an independent actuary applying several financial
assumptions. Assumptions regarding inflation and future wage increases have decreased since the comparison quarter, reducing
the liability whilst the discount rate has increased, resulting in a further reduction. The key assumptions for defined benefit
obligations are:

31‐Mar‐2024 31‐Dec‐2023

Discount rate 3,30% 3,30%

Wage increase 2,20% 2,20%

Inflation 1,70% 1,70%

###### 6. Related party transactions

No transactions have occurred between Assemblin and related parties that substantially impacted the Company’s financial
position and earnings.

###### 7. Events after the balance‐sheet date

**Acquisition of Caverion**

On 1 April 2024, Assemblin Caverion Group AB (formerly named Assemblin Group AB) acquired Crayfish HoldCo Oy, which is the
Parent Company of the Caverion Group (“Caverion acquisition"). Triton as the ultimate parent company of the Caverion Group
transferred 100% of its holding to Assemblin Caverion Group, to create a leading northern European technical and service
installation company. The aggregate consideration of SEK 10,585 million for the Caverion acquisition was funded by (i) an
unconditional shareholder contribution in an amount of SEK 4,822 million (EUR 418 million equivalent) and (ii) a shareholder loan
in the amount of SEK 5,727 (EUR 500 million equivalent). Hence, no actual outgoing or incoming payments have occurred and no
cashflow will be reported related to the Caverion acquisition. There is no purchase consideration liability related to the Caverion
acquisition. There are no acquisition costs in Assemblin Caverion Group AB related to the Caverion acquisition. The estimated
annual sales for Caverion Group based on their latest annual report is approximately EUR 2,491 million with an operating profit of
approximately EUR 77 million. The new Assemblin Caverion Group, including Caverion Group, will have about 21,900 employees
with operations in ten countries and annual sales of approximately EUR 3.8 billion (SEK 43.5 billion). In connection with the
acquisition, Assemblin Group AB changed name to Assemblin Caverion Group AB.

Assemblin Caverion Group is in the process to prepare an acquisition analysis for the recent closed Caverion acquisition. Due to
being a recent transaction initial net asset values included in the acquisition analysis are still to be finalized. Management’s best
estimate as of the date of approval of those consolidated financial statements is that changes in valuation of items in the
acquisition analysis would also affect the preliminary amount of goodwill.

###### * The group goodwill recognized in the preliminary acquisition analysis is mainly attributable to expected synergies from combining operations of the
former Assmeblin Group and Caverion Group as well as a growth agenda, a beneficial business model and a strong organizational culture. None of the
goodwill is expected to be deducted for tax purpose.

_#_ _Measurement of fair values:_
The valuation technique used for measurement of fair values of material assets are as follows.

**Asset class** Valuation technique

Other Intangible assets Acquisition‐related intangible assets have been identified in the preliminary purchase price
allocation relating to order back log, brand and other acquisition related intangible assets. The
estimated useful life for a large proportion of the order back log is two years and a minor proportion
of the order back log has an estimated longer useful life. Brand has an estimated indefinite useful
life.

Right of Use assets / Leasing Leases in the PPA has been remeasured by way of adjusting the long‐term lease liabilities to a value
corresponding to the recognized value of rights‐of‐use assets in Caverion Group’s condensed
consolidated statement of financial position. This is the preliminary assessment.

Deferred taxes Considered based on applicability

The following amounts have been measured on provisional basis:

   - The fair values of Caverion Group’s other intangible assets (order backlog, brand and other acquisition related intangibles) have been measured
provisionally, pending completion of independent valuation.

F5‐11


-----

March 2024

   - Assets such as inventory, ongoing projects and leasing related items are to be valued and the information is still assessed for completeness.
The group has conducted preliminary assessment of the provisions. Other assets and liabilities might also be subject to reassessment.

In connection with the Annual General Meeting on March 27 2024, Susanne Ekblom and Per Ingemar Persson’s term as board
members ended. Two new board members were elected, Mikael Aro and Jacob Götzsche. Jacob Götzsche was elected new
Chairman of the Board.

###### 8. Alternative performance measures

This document contains alternative performance measures. These measures describe historical financial performance, but exclude
or include amounts that would not be adjusted for in the most comparable IFRS financial measure. The alternative performance
measures are used internally by management, in conjunction with IFRS financial measures, to measure performance and make
decisions regarding the future direction of the business. Management believes these alternative performance measures, when
provided in combination with reported IFRS financial measures, provide helpful supplementary information for investors. These
measures are not substitute for or superior to, and should be used in conjunction with, reported IFRS financial measures. In
addition, the alternative performance measures, as defined by Assemblin, may not be comparable to other similarly titled
measures used by other companies. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these alternative performance
measures.

###### Alternative performance measures

ESMA (European Securities and Markets Authority) has issued guidelines regarding Alternative Performance Measures (“APM”). Caverion presents APMs to improve the analysis of business and
financial performance and to enhance the comparability between reporting periods. APMs presented in this report should not be considered as a substitute for measures of performance in
accordance with the IFRS.

EBITDA = Operating profit (EBIT) + depreciation, amortisation and impairment


Adjusted EBITDA = EBITDA before items affecting comparability (IAC) [1)]

EBITA = Operating profit (EBIT) + amortisation and impairment

Adjusted EBITA = EBITA before items affecting comparability (IAC) [1)]


**_1)_** _Items affecting comparability (IAC) are material items or transactions, which are relevant for understanding the financial_

_performance of Caverion when comparing the profit of the current period with that of the previous periods. These items can_
_include (1) capital gains and/or losses and transaction costs related to divestments and acquisitions; (2) write-downs, expenses_
_and/or income from separately identified major risk projects; (3) restructuring expenses and (4) other items that according to_
_Caverion management’s assessment are not related to normal business operations. In 2021 and 2022, major risk projects_
_include only one old risk project in Germany reported under category (2). In 2021 and 2022, provisions and legal and other costs_
_for civil claims related to the German anti-trust matter were reported under category (4). Category (4) includes also advisory_
_costs and personnel bonuses related to the ongoing public tender offer and in 2021, previously capitalised expenses that were_
_booked as operative expenses due to a change in the accounting principle of implementation costs in cloud computing_
_arrangements._


Organic growth =


Defined as the change in revenue in local currencies excluding the
impacts of (i) currencies; and (ii) acquisitions and divestments. The
currency impact shows the impact of changes in exchange rates of
subsidiaries with a currency other than the euro (Group’s reporting
currency). The acquisitions and divestments impact shows how
acquisitions and divestments completed during the current or previous
year affect the revenue reported.

###### 1 Basis of
 preparation

 The consolidated financial statements of Caverion Corporation have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. 

 Accounting principles
can be found next to the relevant notes
in sections 2–6.


-----

###### General Information

Caverion Corporation (the “Parent company” or the “Company”) with its subsidiaries (together,
“Caverion” or “Caverion Group”) is a Finnish service company in building systems, construction
services and services for the industry. Caverion designs, builds, operates and maintains userfriendly and energy-efficient technical solutions for buildings and industries throughout the life
cycle of the property. Caverion’s services are used in offices and retail properties, housing,
public premises, industrial plants and infrastructure, among other places.

Caverion Corporation is domiciled in Helsinki, Finland and its registered address is Torpantie
2, 01650 Vantaa, Finland. The company’s shares are listed on the NASDAQ OMX Helsinki Ltd
as of July 1, 2013. The copies of the consolidated financial statements are available at
www.caverion.com or at the parent company’s head office, Torpantie 2, 01650 Vantaa, Finland.

On June 30, 2013, the partial demerger of Building Systems business (the “demerger”) of
YIT Corporation became effective. At this date, all of the assets and liabilities directly related to
Building Systems business were transferred to Caverion Corporation, a new company
established in the partial demerger.

These consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors
in their meeting on 8 February 2023 after which, in accordance with Finnish Company Law, the
financial statements are either approved, amended or rejected in the Annual General Meeting.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the basis of
preparation and accounting policies set out below.

The consolidated financial statements of Caverion Corporation have been prepared in
accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the
European Union observing the standards and interpretations effective on December 31, 2022.
The notes to the consolidated financial statements also comply with the requirements of Finnish
accounting and corporate legislation complementing the IFRS regulation.

The figures in these consolidated financial statements are presented in million euros, unless
stated otherwise. Rounding differences may occur.

Caverion Group’s consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended 2022 have
been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for investments, financial assets and
liabilities at fair value through profit and loss and derivative instruments at fair value. Equitysettled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the grant date.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain
critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the
process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of
judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the
consolidated financial statements are disclosed under “Critical accounting estimates and
judgements” below.


###### Consolidation

 Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and
operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than 50% of the voting rights.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible
are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully
consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated
from the date that control ceases.

The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The total
consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets
transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by Caverion Group. The total
consideration includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent
consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable
assets acquired, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are
measured initially at their fair value at the acquisition date. On an acquisition-by-acquisition
basis, the Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at
the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s assets.

Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions
between Group companies are eliminated.

###### Disposal of subsidiaries

When the Group ceases to have control, any remaining interest in the entity is re-measured to
its fair value at the date when control is lost, with the change in the carrying amount recognised
through profit and loss. In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive
income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if realised and recognised in the income
statement. If the interest is reduced but control is retained, only a proportionate share of the
amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are booked to non-controlling
interest in equity.

###### Transactions with non-controlling interests

The Group accounts transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control
as equity transactions. The difference between the fair value of any consideration paid and the
relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity.
Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.


-----

###### Critical accounting estimates and judgements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make
estimates and exercise judgement in the application of the accounting policies. Estimates and
judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and expectations
of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The resulting
accounting estimates may deviate from the related actual results. The estimates and
assumptions that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below. Accounting estimates
and judgements are commented in more detail in connection with each item.

   - Goodwill

   - Acquisitions and disposals

   - Revenue from contracts with customers

   - Income taxes

   - Provisions

   - Employee benefit obligations

   - Trade receivables

###### Foreign currency translation and transactions

Items included in the consolidated financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are
measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates
(the functional currency). These consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which
is the Group’s presentation currency.

The income statements of foreign Group companies are translated into euro using the
average exchange rate for the reporting period. The balance sheets are translated at the closing
rate at the date of that balance sheet. Translating the result for the period using different
exchange rates in the income statement and balance sheet results in a translation difference,
which is recognised in other comprehensive income.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated
as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. Exchange
differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income. When a foreign subsidiary is
disposed of or sold, exchange differences that were recorded in equity are recognised in the
income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange
rates prevailing on the date of transaction or valuation, where items are re-measured. Foreign
exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the

SEK 10.6278 10.1452 11.1218 10.2503

.

###### Operating segments

The profitability of Caverion Group has been presented as one operating segment from 1
January 2014 onwards. The chief operating decision-maker of Caverion is the Board of
Directors. Due to the management structure of Caverion, nature of its operations and its
business areas, Group is the relevant reportable operating segment.

###### New standards and amendments adopted

 Evaluation of the future impact of new standards and interpretations

Caverion has adopted the new standards and interpretations that were effective during the
accounting period and are relevant to its operations. These amendments had no impact on the
consolidated financial statements of Caverion. A number of new standards and amendments to
standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2022,
and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements. The Group is
not expecting a significant impact of those to the consolidated financial statements.


translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are recognised in the income statement. Foreign exchange gains and losses that
relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the income statement
within “Finance income and expenses”. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are
presented in the income statement above operating profit. Non-monetary items are mainly
measured at the exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction date.

Caverion Group applies exchange rates published by the European Central Bank in the
consolidated financial statements. Exchange rates used in euros:

###### 2.1 Revenue from contracts with customers

The disaggregation of revenue is set out below by Business Units and by division. The
reportable segment of Caverion is the Group and thus, no reconciliation between segments
and revenue from contracts with customers is presented.

general increasing interest for services supporting sustainability, such as energy
management and advisory services. In Projects, the market demand remained mostly stable.
The interest for energy improvement projects has picked up, driven by the focus on energy
consumption due to the energy crisis. Caverion carried out 12 acquisitions during the year,
revenue increased by 2.2 (-0.2) percent as a result of acquisitions and divestments.

###### Contract balances

**EUR million** **12/31/2022** **12/31/2021**

**Contract assets**
POC receivables 231.3 195.6

Work in progress 7.5 3.2

**Contract liabilities**

Advances received [1)] 286.2 261.3

Accrued expenses from long-term contracts 28.7 30.2

1) Advances received consist of advances received in cash and advances relating to percentage of completion method.

Amounts included in the contract liabilities at the beginning of the year are mainly recognised
as revenue during the financial year. Revenue recognised from performance obligations
satisfied in the previous years was not material in 2022 or 2021.

###### Performance obligations

A performance obligation is a distinct good or service within a contract that customer can
benefit on stand-alone basis.

In Projects and Services business, performance obligation is satisfied by transferring
control of a work delivered to a customer. At Caverion, control is transferred mainly over time
and payment is generally due within 14-45 days.

In most of the contracts that Caverion has with its customers only one performance
obligation is identified. Many contracts include different building systems (e.g. heating,
sanitation, ventilation, air conditioning and electricity) that the customer has ordered from
Caverion. All the different building systems (i.e. disciplines) could be distinct, because the
customer could benefit from those on their own or together with other resources that are
readily available. However, those are not concluded to be distinct in the context of the contract



_* Other countries include the Baltic countries and Russia. Caverion divested its Russian subsidiary in December 2021, which_
_explains the year on year decline in revenue. Baltic countries revenue increased slightly in 2022 compared to last year._

Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised mainly over time.

Revenue increased in both Business units, Services business revenue increased by 12.0%
and Projects business unit revenue by 6.1%. Revenue increased in all divisions during 2022,
despite the geopolitical tensions related to the war in Ukraine and resulting energy crisis,
mounting inflation and rising interest rates that lowered the economic growth prospects. Rapid
rise in inflation during the year had a positive effect on revenue. Caverion has managed to
cover material cost increases in pricing In Services the market demand and general

one package. In addition, Caverion provides also project management services and is
responsible for managing the project. This integrates the different goods and services as one
total deliverable / combined output to the customer, which has been agreed in the contract
and from the commercial point there are no separable risks related to the different parts of
the project, as the project has one total price for the full delivery and possible sanctions are
defined at the contract level.

In Services business performance obligations are maintenance agreements and separate
repair orders which are distinct. Caverion has lifecycle contracts, where maintenance phases
are recognised over time as separate performance obligations. During the maintenance
period, Caverion receives payments on a monthly basis. The consideration of the
maintenance periods are tied to the maintenance index. Revenue is recognised under
percentage of completion method and the stage of completion of these contracts are
measured by reference to the contract costs incurred up to the end of the reporting period as
a percentage of total estimated costs for the contract.

###### Remaining performance obligations

The transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations (unsatisfied or
partially unsatisfied) as at 31 December is as follows:

**EUR million** **2022** **2021**

Within one year 1,228.7 937.5

More than one year 714.6 926.3

**Total (order backlog)** **1,943.3** **1,863.8**

**Accounting principles**
Income from the sale of products and services is recognised as revenue at fair value net of
indirect taxes and discounts.

Revenue from sales of goods is recorded when the significant risks and rewards and
control associated with the ownership of the goods have been transferred to the buyer.
Revenue for sales of short-term services is recognised in the accounting period in which the
services are rendered. Revenue is recognised when, or as, the customer obtains control of
the goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects
to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.

Contracts under percentage of completion method are recognized as revenue on the
stage of completion basis when the outcome of the project can be estimated reliably. The
stage of completion of these contracts are measured by reference to the contract costs


revenue recognized based on the stage of completion is recognized in advances received.
Invoicing which is less than the revenue recognized on the percentage of completion basis is
deferred and presented as related accrued income. Costs in excess of the stage of completion
are capitalised as work in progress and costs below the stage of completion are recorded as
accrued expenses from long-term contracts.

Due to estimates included in the revenue recognition of contracts under percentage of
completion method, revenue and profit presented by financial period only rarely correspond
to the equal distribution of the total profit over the duration of the project. When revenue
recognition is based on the percentage of completion method, the outcome of the projects
and contracts is regularly and reliably estimated. Calculation of the total income of projects
involves estimates on the total costs required to complete the project as well as on the
development of billable work. If the estimates regarding the outcome of a contract change,
the revenue and result recognised are adjusted in the reporting period when the change first
becomes known and can be estimated. If it is probable that the total costs required to
complete a contract will exceed the total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised
as an expense immediately.

Revenue is recognised from any variable consideration at its estimated amount, if it is
highly probable that no significant reversal of revenue will occur.

Caverion’s customer contracts do not usually include any significant financing
components.

The Group can also carry out a pre-agreed single project or a long-term service agreement
through a construction consortium. The construction consortium is not a separate legal entity.
The participating companies usually have a joint responsibility. Projects and service
agreements performed by the consortium are included in the reporting of the Group company
and revenue is recognised on the stage of completion basis according to the Group
company’s share in the consortium.

**Accounting principles**
Tax expenses in the income statement comprise current and deferred taxes. Taxes are
recognised in the income statement except when they are associated with items recognised
in other comprehensive income or directly in shareholders' equity. Current taxes are
calculated on the taxable income on the basis of the tax rate stipulated for each country by
the balance sheet date. Taxes are adjusted for the taxes of previous financial periods, if
applicable. Management evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in
which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. The tax provisions recognised in
such situations are based on evaluations by management. Evaluating the total amount of
income taxes at the Group level requires significant judgement, so the amount of total tax
includes uncertainty.

**Earnings per share, basic, EUR** **0.32** **0.17**

**Accounting principles**
Earnings per share is calculated by dividing the result for the financial year attributable to the
owners of the parent company (adjusted with the paid hybrid capital expenses and interests
and accrued unrecognised interest after tax) by the weighted average number of shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the
number of shares to assume conversion of all diluting potential shares. There were no diluting
effects in 2022 and 2021.

The Group did not make any material write-downs in inventories in 2022 or 2021.

**Accounting principles**
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The acquisition cost of
materials and supplies is determined using the weighted average cost formula. The
acquisition cost of work in progress comprises the value of materials, direct costs of labour,
other direct costs and a systematic allocation of the variable manufacturing overheads and
fixed overhead. The net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the course of ordinary
business less the estimated cost of completion and the estimated cost to make the sale.

**Operational credit risk of receivables**
Caverion’s operational credit risk arises from outstanding receivable balances and long-term
agreements with customers. Customer base and the nature of commercial contracts are
different in each country, and local teams are responsible for ongoing monitoring of customerspecific credit risk. The exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.

The Group manages credit risk relating to operating items, for instance, by advance
payments, upfront payment programs in projects, payment guarantees and careful
assessment of the credit quality of the customer. Majority of Caverion Group’s operating
activities are based on established, reliable customer relationships and generally adopted
contractual terms. The payment terms of the invoices are mainly from 14 to 45 days. Credit
background of new customers is assessed comprehensively and when necessary,
guarantees are required and client’s paying behavior is monitored actively. Caverion Group
does not have any significant concentrations of credit risk as the clientele is widespread and
geographically spread into the countries in which the Group operates.

The Group’s largest overdue trade receivables relate to legal cases of old projects, for
which there exist separate legal opinions justifying the validity of the receivables. Caverion
Group did not experience any major unexpected credit losses in 2022 Group management


-----

9 at year-end closing and it was assessed to be sufficient. Overall, Group management
assessed the Group’s credit risk position to be at about previous year’s level.

Credit losses and impairment of receivables amounted to EUR -0.3 (+1.4) million. The
Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date (December 31, 2022) is
the carrying amount of the financial assets. There are EUR 24.9 (30.7) million overdue
receivables that are more than 180 days old. Receivables and the related risk are monitored
on a regular basis and risk assessments are updated always when there are changes in
circumstances. The receivable is impaired if payment is considered unlikely.

Current receivables include operative risks which are described in more detail in the Board
of Directors’ Report.

**Accounting principles**
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for merchandise sold or services
performed in the ordinary course of business. If collection is expected in 12 months or less,
they are classified as current. If not, they are presented as non-current.

The Group recognises an impairment loss on receivables when there is objective evidence
that payment is not expected to occur. Recognised impairment loss includes estimates and
critical judgements. The estimates are based on historical credit losses, past practice of credit
management, client specific analysis and economic conditions at the assessment date. In
addition to impairment losses recognized based on the evidence that the receivable cannot
be collected in full, IFRS 9 establishes a new model for recognition and measurement of
impairments in loans and receivables - the so-called expected credit losses model. Caverion
has chosen to apply a simplified credit loss matrix for trade receivables as the trade
receivables do not contain significant financing components. The provision matrix is based
on an entity’s historical default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables and is
adjusted for forward-looking estimates. The lifetime expected credit loss provision is
calculated by multiplying the gross carrying amount of outstanding trade receivables by an
expected default rate. Changes in expected credit losses are recognized in other operating
expenses in the consolidated income statement.

If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease
can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the
previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through the income statement.


Due to the application of the percentage of completion method, part of reliably estimated
impairment losses are included in the cost estimate of a project and considered as weakened
margin forecast. Therefore impairment losses of trade receivables in onerous projects are
included in the loss reserve.

**Accounting principles**
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the
ordinary course of business from suppliers. Trade payables are classified as current liabilities
if payment is due within 12 months or less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.

The recognition of provisions involves estimates concerning probability, time of realization and quantity. As of December 31, 2022 the provisions amounted to EUR 38.1 (44.6) million.


**Accounting principles**
Provisions are recorded when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation on the basis of a
past event, the realisation of the payment obligation is probable and the amount of the obligation
can be reliably estimated. Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditure
required to settle the obligation. If reimbursement for some or all of the obligations can be
received from a third party, the reimbursement is recorded as a separate asset, but only when it
is practically certain


that said reimbursement will be received. Provisions are recognised for onerous contracts when
the unavoidable costs required to meet obligations exceed the benefits expected to be received
under the contract. The amount of the warranty provision is set on the basis of experience of the
realisation of these commitments.

Provisions for restructuring are recognised when the Group has made a detailed
restructuring plan and initiated the implementation of the plan, or has communicated of it.

The Group's unused tax losses carried forward amounted to EUR 57.4 million, for which corresponding
deferred tax assets of EUR 16.4 million have not been recorded as of 31 December 2022 since the
realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits was considered not probable. These tax
losses carried forward do not have an expiration date.


-----

**Accounting principles**
Deferred taxes are calculated on all temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. No deferred taxes are calculated
on goodwill impairment that is not deductible in taxation and no deferred taxes are recognised
on the undistributed profits of subsidiaries to the extent that the difference is unlikely to be
reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred taxes have been calculated using the statutory tax
rates or the tax rates substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are
only recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against
which the temporary difference can be utilized.

The most significant temporary differences arise from differences between the recognised
revenue from long-term contracts using the percentage of completion method and taxable


income, measurement at fair value in connection with business combinations and unused tax
losses.
Deferred tax assets on taxable losses are booked to the extent the benefit is expected to be
possible to deduct from the taxable profit in the future. Deferred tax liability on undistributed
earnings of subsidiaries, where the tax will be paid on the distribution of earnings, has not been
recognized in the statement of financial position, because distribution of the earnings is in the
control of the Group and it is not probable in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against
current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income
taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable
entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.

The goodwill arising from the 2022 acquisitions amounted to EUR 73.2 million and was
mainly attributable to personnel know-how, expected synergies and geographical coverage.
From the generated goodwill, EUR 1.4 million was considered tax deductible. The nominal and
fair values of the acquired trade and other receivables did not differ materially. The transaction
costs from the acquisitions completed during 2022 amounted to EUR 3.5 million and were
expensed during the fiscal year as a part of other operating expenses.

**DI-Teknik**
On 1 April 2022, Caverion closed on an agreement to acquire the shares of the Danish DI-Teknik
A/S. DI-Teknik is one of Denmark’s largest industrial automation companies with approximately
185 employees at the time of the acquisition. DI-Teknik operates as a full-service provider
(design, dimensioning, programming, installation and maintenance) in industrial automation, IT
and electrification. The acquisition brought completely new expertise and capabilities in industrial
automation to Caverion in Denmark as well as strengthened Caverion's capability to provide
smart, digital and sustainable solutions for the industrial segment also more widely outside
Denmark.

80% of DI-Teknik’s shares were transferred into Caverion's ownership in April 2022 and
Caverion is committed to purchasing the remaining 20% latest in April 2026. Based on this,
Caverion consolidated DI-Teknik into the Group's figures based on 100% ownership already in
2022 and recognised a purchase consideration liability for the remaining 20%. The revenue of
DI-Teknik A/S for the fiscal year 1 July 2020 - 30 June 2021 amounted to EUR 27.8 million and
EBITDA to EUR 2.3 million according to the company's local accounting standards. DI-Teknik's
nine-month IFRS revenue after the acquisition date for the year 2022 amounted to EUR 24.7
million and EBITDA excluding IFRS 16 adjustments to EUR 2.4 million. The transaction price
was not disclosed.

**PORREAL**
On 2 August 2022, Caverion closed on an agreement to acquire all the shares in PORREAL
GmbH in Austria, also including its fully owned subsidiary ALEA GmbH. PORREAL offers
technical facility services and real estate consulting services while ALEA offers soft facility
services. The acquisition strengthened Caverion's position in the Austrian facility services
market. At the time of the acquisition, PORREAL Group employed approximately 380
employees, 120 of which were employed by PORREAL GmbH. On 28 December 2022, Caverion
divested the shares of ALEA GmbH.

The 2021 revenue of PORREAL GmbH amounted to EUR 23.3 million and EBITDA to EUR
2.4 million according to the company’s local accounting standards. The five-month IFRS revenue
after the acquisition date for the year 2022 amounted to EUR 11.7 million and EBITDA excluding
IFRS 16 adjustments to EUR 1.0 million. ALEA GmbH's revenue amounted to EUR 4.2 million
during Caverion's ownership and it did not have a material effect on the Group's profitability. The
transaction price was not disclosed.

Caverion applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The total
consideration transferred for the acquisition is the fair value of the assets transferred, the
liabilities incurred and the possible equity interests issued by Caverion Group. The total
consideration includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent
consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable
assets acquired, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are
measured initially at their fair value at the acquisition date. The measurement of the fair values
requires management judgement and is based partly on management's estimates.

The consolidation of the acquired businesses in accordance with IFRS 3 is still provisional
as of 31 December 2022. Therefore, the fair value measurement of the assets and liabilities
acquired during 2022 is preliminary and subject to adjustments during the 12-month period
during which the acquisition calculations will be finalized.

**_1)_** _In 2022, Caverion decreased its estimate of the contingent consideration receivable related to the 2021 divestment of JSC_
_"Caverion Rus" by EUR 0.1 million._


###### Year 2022

On 28 December 2022, Caverion sold the shares of ALEA GmbH to Avalon GmbH. ALEA
provides soft facility services in Austria and was transferred to Caverion's ownership in the
August 2022 acquisition of the PORREAL Group. ALEA employed 230 persons at the time of
the divestment and its revenue for the time in Caverion's ownership amounted to EUR 4.2
million. The divestment did not have a material effect on Caverion's profitability. The transaction
price was not disclosed. The transaction costs were expensed during the fiscal year and were
not material in value.

###### Year 2021

In the end of December 2021, Caverion sold the share capital of its subsidiary JSC “Caverion
Rus” in Russia to Aim Cosmetics Rus, LTD. The transaction covered Caverion’s entire
operations in Russia which are focused on the St. Petersburg and Moscow regions and
employed 421 persons at the end of 2021. The divestment of the Russian subsidiary was a part
of Caverion's strategy to focus on the Group's core businesses in its main market areas and to
improve the Group's financial performance.

The IFRS revenue of Caverion's Russian operations amounted to EUR 13.9 million and
EBITDA to EUR 0.5 million in 2021. The figures of JSC “Caverion Rus" were included in the
Group's consolidated income statement until the end of 2021. Caverion recognised a capital loss
of EUR 10.0 million in relation to the divestment in its 2021 result. The largest part of the capital
loss was related to negative translation differences which had no cash flow effect or effect on
the Group’s total equity. In 2022, Caverion decreased its estimate of the contingent
consideration receivable by EUR 0.1 million. The transaction costs amounted to EUR 0.3 million
and were expensed partly during the fiscal year 2021 and partly in 2022.

###### 4.2 Goodwill

Finland 96.4 80.8

Germany 77.7 77.7

Norway 72.3 69.8

Industry 71.6 64.6

Sweden 49.1 47.7

Austria 42.8 21.6


-----

**Total goodwill** **442.5** **369.9**

In 2022, Caverion completed 12 acquisitions, the largest of which were the acquisitions of the
Austrian PORREAL Group and the Danish DI-Teknik A/S and CS electric A/S. In 2022 Goodwill
increased by EUR 72.6 million and the goodwill arising from the 2022 acquisitions amounted to
EUR 73.2 million and was mainly attributable to personnel know-how, expected synergies and
geographical coverage.

In 2021, Caverion completed seven bolt-on acquisitions, the largest of which was the
acquisition of the Austrian GTS Immobilien GmbH. The goodwill arising from the 2021
acquisitions amounted to EUR 4.9 million and was mainly attributable to personnel know-how,
expected synergies and geographical coverage.

Goodwill is reviewed for potential impairment whenever there is an indication that the current
value may be impaired, or at least annually. Impairment testing of goodwill is carried out by
allocating goodwill to the lowest cash generating unit level (CGU) which generates independent
cash flows. The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units (CGU) are determined on the
basis of value-in-use calculations. The future cash flow projections are based on the budget
approved by the top management and the Board of Directors and other long-term financial plans.
After this there is a critical assessment of the cash flows related to the goodwill impairment
testing. Cash flow projections cover three years, the terminal value is defined by extrapolating it
on the basis of average development during the forecasted planning horizon. Cash flows beyond
the forecast period are projected by using 1.75 percent long-term growth rate that is based on a
prudent estimate about the long-term growth rate and inflation. Future growth estimates are
based on the former experience and information available by external market research
institutions on market development.

The discount rate used in the impairment testing is the weighted average pre-tax cost of
capital (WACC). The discount rate reflects the total cost of equity and debt and the market risks
related to the segment. The country-specific WACC components are: the risk-free interest rate,
the market risk premium and the credit spread. The common components for all tested CGUs
are; the comparable peer industry beta, the Group capital structure and the size premium based
on Caverion Group's size.

Estimating the future cash flows of CGUs has been challenging in 2022 due to the corona
pandemic, the war in Ukraine and there-related uncertainty in the economic environment. As
part of the goodwill impairment testing, management cautiously assessed the future cash flows
of the CGUs while taking into account the current economic environment. Management
considered the fact that the Group’s cash flows have been strong in the past few years and also
profitability of most of the CGUs was on an improving track in 2022.

The goodwill test results are evaluated by comparing the recoverable amount (E) with the
carrying value of the CGU assets (T), as follows:

**Ratio** **Estimate**

E < T Impairment

E 0 - 20% - T Slightly above

E 20 - 50% - T Clearly above

E 50% - - T Substantially above

As a result of the impairment tests performed, no impairment loss has been recognised in 2022
or in 2021. In the 2022 testing the recoverable amount exceeded the balance sheet value in
Germany, Denmark and Industry clearly and in other CGUs substantially. In the 2021 testing the
recoverable amount exceeded the balance sheet value in Germany clearly and in other CGUs
substantially. Management has assessed that in Germany (CGU 6) a reasonably possible
change in key assumptions might lead into impairment. Management has prepared sensitivity
analysis for that CGU:

**Values for sensitivity analysis in separate** **Change in**
**scenarios (1, 2, 3), with which recoverable** **value resulting**
**amount = balance sheet value, Germany** **Basic assumption** **in break even**

Revenue in the forecast period (scenario 1) 4.0% average growth

(CAGR) -5.5% p.p.

Average EBITDA percentage in the forecast
period (scenario 1) 5.8% -0.9% p.p.

Pre-tax WACC (scenario 2) 10.55% +3.2% p.p.

Terminal growth assumption (scenario 3) 1.75% -2.5% p.p.


**Accounting principles**

Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration
transferred over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the net identifiable assets of the
acquiree and the fair value of the non-controlling interest in the acquiree on the date of
acquisition. The net identifiable assets include the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed
as well as the contingent liabilities. The consideration transferred is measured at fair value.

Impairment testing
Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes
in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill
is allocated to cash-generating units. Goodwill is measured at the original acquisition cost less
impairment. Impairment is expensed immediately in the income statement and is not
subsequently reversed. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying
amount of goodwill relating to the entity disposed of.

Goodwill is tested for any impairment annually in accordance with the accounting policy. The
recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value-in-use
calculations. The cash flows in the value-in-use calculations are based on the management's
best estimate of market development for the subsequent years. The discount rate may be
increased with a branch specific risk factor.

The recoverable amounts have been assessed in relation to different time periods and the
sensitivity has been analysed for the changes of the discount rate, profitability and the terminal
growth rate.

**Accounting principles**
An intangible asset is initially recognised in the balance sheet at acquisition cost when the
acquisition cost can be reliably determined and the economic benefits are expected to flow
from the asset to the Group. Intangible assets with a known or estimated limited useful life
are expensed in the income statement on a straight-line basis over their useful life.

Other intangible assets acquired in connection with business acquisitions are recognised
separately from goodwill if they meet the definition of an intangible asset: they are separable
or are based on contractual or other legal rights. Intangible assets recognised in connection
with business acquisitions include e.g. the value of customer agreements and associated
customer relationships, prohibition of competition agreements, the value of acquired
technology and industry related process competences. The value of customer agreements
and their associated customer relationships and industry related process competence is
determined using the cash flows estimated according to the durability and duration of the
assumed customer relations.


**Impairment of tangible and intangible assets**
At each closing date, the Group evaluates whether there is an indication that an asset may
be impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of said asset is estimated.
In addition, the recoverable amount is assessed annually for each of the following assets
regardless of whether there is any indication of impairment: goodwill, intangible assets with
an indefinite useful life and intangible assets not yet available for use. The need for
impairment is assessed at the level of cash-generating units.

The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and
the value in use. The value in use is determined based on the discounted future net cash
flows estimated to be recoverable from the assets in question or cash-generating units. The
discount rate used is a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value
of money and the risks specific to the asset. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying
amount of the asset is higher than its recoverable amount. The impairment loss is recognised
immediately in the income statement and is initially allocated to the goodwill allocated to the
cash-generating unit and thereafter to other assets pro rata on the basis of their carrying
amounts. An impairment loss is reversed when the circumstances change and the amount
recoverable from the asset has changed since the date when the impairment loss was
recorded. However, impairment losses are not reversed beyond the carrying amount of the
asset that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior
years. Impairment losses on goodwill are never reversed.

###### 5.1 Capital management

The objective of capital management in Caverion Group is to maintain an optimal capital
structure, maximise the return on the respective capital employed and to minimise the cost of
capital within the limits and principles stated in the Treasury Policy. The capital structure is
modified primarily by directing investments and working capital employed.

In February Caverion issued a senior unsecured bond of EUR 75 million with an issue
price of 99.425 percent. The 5-year bond matures on 25 February 2027 and carries a fixed
annual interest of 2.75 percent. Also, Caverion carried out a tender offer for the EUR 75 million
bond maturing in March 2023 resulting to a EUR 71.5 million acceptance level. The new bond
extends the maturity profile, lowers the interest expenses and supports Caverion’s strategy
for sustainable profitable growth.

Caverion has an outstanding hybrid bond in amount of EUR 35 million, Hybrid bond is an
instrument subordinated to the company’s other debt obligations and treated as equity in the
IFRS financial statements. The hybrid bond does not have a maturity date but the issuer is
entitled to redeem the hybrid for the first time on 15 May 2023, and subsequently, on each
coupon interest payment date.

Caverion's business model is asset light and typically requires little investments.
Caverion’s targeted operational capex level (excluding acquisitions and capitalised lease
contracts) should not exceed 1 percent of revenue. Growth will be supported by bolt-on
acquisitions in selected growth areas and complementary capabilities. Caverion aims at 100
per cent cash conversion (operating cash flow before financial and tax items/EBITDA) in order
to ensure a healthy cash flow.

Caverion’s management evaluates and continuously monitors the amount of funding
required in the Group’s business activities to ensure it has adequate liquid funds to finance
its operations, repay its loans at maturity and pay annual dividends. The funding requirements
have been evaluated based on an annual budget, monthly financial forecasts and short-term,
timely cash planning. Caverion’s Group Treasury is responsible for maintaining sufficient
funding, availability of different funding sources and a controlled maturity profile for the
external loans. Caverion targets a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of less than 2.5 times.

Cash management and funding is centralised in Group Treasury. With a centralised cash
management, the use of liquid funds can be optimised between different units of the Group.

Caverion’s aim is to distribute at least 50 % of the result for the year after taxes, however,
taking profitability and leverage level into account.

The total number of Caverion Corporation's shares was 138,920,092 (138,920,092) and the
share capital amounted to EUR 1.0 (1.0) million on December 31, 2022.

All the issued and subscribed shares have been fully paid to the company. Shares do not
have a nominal value.

###### Treasury shares

Caverion held 2,447,447 (2,502,467) treasury shares on December 31, 2022.

The consideration paid for the treasury shares amounted to EUR 2.0 million on December
31, 2022 and is disclosed as a separate fund in equity. The consideration paid on treasury
shares decreases the distributable equity of Caverion Corporation. Caverion Corporation
holds the own shares as treasury shares and has the right to return them to the market in the
future.

###### Translation differences

Translation differences include the exchange rate differences recognised in Group
consolidation. In addition, the portion of the gains and losses of effective hedges on the net
investment in foreign subsidiaries, which are hedged with currency forwards, is recognised in
equity. There were no hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation in 2022 or 2021.

###### Fair value reserve

Fair value reserve includes movements in the fair value of the investments that are not held
for trading, and the derivative instruments used for cash flow hedging.

###### Hybrid capital

On 15 May 2020 Caverion issued a EUR 35 million hybrid bond, an instrument subordinated
to the company's other debt obligations and treated as equity in the IFRS financial statements.
The hybrid bond does not confer to its holders the rights of a shareholder and does not dilute
the holdings of the current shareholders. The coupon of the hybrid bond is 6.75 per cent per
annum until 15 May 2023. The hybrid bond does not have a maturity date but the issuer is
entitled to redeem the hybrid for the first time on 15 May 2023, and subsequently, on each
coupon interest payment date. If the hybrid bond is not redeemed on 15 May 2023, the coupon
will be changed to 3-month EURIBOR added with a Re-offer Spread (706.8 bps) and a step

up of 500bps. The accrued unrecognized interest on the bond was EUR 1.5 (1.5) million at
31 December 2022.

The interest from the hybrid bond must be paid to the investors if Caverion Corporation
pays dividends. If dividends are not paid, a separate decision regarding interest payment on
the hybrid bond will be made. The hybrid bond is initially recognised at fair value less
transaction costs and subsequently the bond is measured at cost. If interest is paid to the
hybrid bond, it is debited directly to equity, net of any related income tax benefit. In 2022, EUR
2.4 million interest was paid.

According to IAS 33, interest accrued in local books has been taken into account as an
expense in earnings per share calculation as described in calculation of key figures.

###### Unrestricted equity reserve

Caverion announced in a stock exchange release on 7 February 2018 the establishment of
a new share-based incentive plan directed at the key employees of the Group (“Matching
Share Plan 2018-2022”). In connection with the technical execution of the plan a total of
3,800,000 new shares were subscribed for in Caverion Corporation’s share issue directed to
the company itself without payment, and were entered into the Trade Register on 19 February
2018. The total capital raised amounted to EUR 6.67 million and was recorded in entirety into
the unrestricted equity reserve.

Caverion executed a directed share issue of new shares in June 2018 in order to maintain
a strong balance sheet and to retain strategic flexibility after the payment of the German antitrust fine. On 15 June 2019, the Company announced that it had directed a share issue of
9,524,000 new shares in the Company to institutional investors, corresponding to
approximately 7.36 percent of all the shares and votes in the Company immediately prior to
the share issue raising gross proceeds of EUR 60.0 million. The subscription price was
recorded in its entirety into the unrestricted equity reserve of the company.

###### Dividends

The Annual General Meeting held on 28 March 2022 decided that a dividend of EUR 0.17 per
share will be paid for the year 2021.

The Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting to be held on 27 March
2023 that a dividend of EUR 0.20 per share will be paid for the year 2022.

###### 5.4 Financial assets and liabilities by category

IFRS 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement categories for financial assets: amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive
income (FVTOCI) and fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL). The standard has been applied as of 1 January 2018.

The carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities except for non-current loans approximate
their fair value. The fair value of non-current loans amounted to EUR 140.1 (136.8) million at the
end of 2022. The fair values of non-current loans are based on discounted cash flows and are
categorised within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Discount rate is defined to be the rate that
the Group was to pay for an equivalent external loan at year end. It consists of a risk-free market
rate and a company and maturity related risk premium of 2.00% p.a (1.00% - 2.00% in 2021).

**Investments consist of as follows:**
**2022** **2021**

Quoted shares (level 1 in fair value hierarchy) 0.4 0.6

Unquoted shares (level 3 in fair value hierarchy) 0.7 0.7

**Total** **1.1** **1.3**

The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market
prices at the balance sheet date. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily
and regularly available from an exchange and those prices represent actual and regularly
occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis. The quoted market price used for
financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price. These instruments are included in
Level 1. Instruments included in Level 1 comprise primarily funds and OMXH equity
investments. Investments categorised in Level 3 are non-listed equity instruments and they are
measured at acquisition cost less any impairment or prices obtained from a broker as their fair
value cannot be measured reliably.

**Accounting principles**

**Financial assets**
**Classification and measurement**
Financial assets are classified at initial recognition into the following categories according to
IFRS 9: at fair value through profit or loss, at fair value through other comprehensive income
and at amortised cost. The classification depends on the objective of the business model and
the characteristics of contractual cash flows of the item.

**Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss**
Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss are financial assets or derivatives that do
not meet the criteria for hedge accounting. A financial asset is classified in this category if
acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. Derivatives and other financial
assets at fair value through profit and loss are initially measured at fair value and transaction
costs are expensed in the income statement. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are
measured at fair value. Realised and unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in fair
l i d i h i i h i d i hi h h i A i hi


months and as current assets (Trade and other receivables) if expected to be settled within 12
months.

**Amortised cost**
The Group’s non-derivative financial assets and cash and cash equivalents are classified to
amortised cost category. This category comprises loans receivables, trade receivables, cash
and cash equivalents and other receivables. These are included in current assets, except for
maturities greater than 12 months after the reporting period, which are classified as non-current.
These assets are initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs are expensed in the
income statement. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are carried at amortised cost using the
effective interest rate method less any impairment. Due to the nature of short-term receivables
and other receivables, their book value is expected to equal to the fair value.

Cash and cash equivalents include cash at hand, bank deposits withdrawable on demand
and liquid short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less.

**Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income**
Equity investments in non-listed investments that are not held for trading, are classified as equity
instruments designated at fair value through other comprehensive income.

These assets are initially recognised at fair value, plus any transaction costs. Subsequent to
initial recognition, they are carried at fair value. Changes in the fair value are recognised in other
comprehensive income and are presented in the fair value reserves under shareholders' equity,
net of tax. When investments are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments
recognised in equity are never recycled to income statement.

These assets are non-current financial assets when the Group intends not to dispose them
within the next 12 months.

**Recognition and derecognition**
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade-date which is the
date on which Caverion Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets are
derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investment have expired or have
been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risk and rewards of ownership.

Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the financial assets at fair value
through profit or loss category are presented in the income statement within finance income and
expenses in the period in which they arise. Interest income from items at amortised cost are
presented in the income statement within finance income in the period in which they arise.
Dividend income from financial assets is recognised in the income statement as part of financial
income when the Group’s right to receive payments is established.


-----

**Offsetting financial instruments**
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet
when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an
intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

**Impairment of financial assets**
**Assets carried at amortised costs**
Caverion Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective
evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired as a result of one or more
events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (“a loss event”). That loss event
must impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets
that can be reliably estimated.

Objective evidence that financial assets are impaired includes: default or delinquency in
interest or principal payments, significant financial difficulty, restructuring of an amount due to
the Group, indications that a debtor will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation,
observable data indicating that there is measurable decrease in expected cash flows, such as
changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults.

For loans and receivables, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the
asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the
asset’s original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the
amount of the loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement within other operating
expenses. Caverion Group considers evidence of impairment at both an individual asset and a
collective level. All individually significant assets are individually assessed for impairment.
Collective assessment is carried out by grouping together assets with similar risk characteristics.

Risks related to trade and other operative receivables are described in note 3.2.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease
can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the
previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through the income statement.

**Financial liabilities**
Borrowings are recorded on the settlement date and initially at fair value, net of transaction costs
incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost and any difference between the
proceeds and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the
borrowings using the effective interest method. Other borrowing costs are expensed in the period
during which they are incurred. Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised
as expenses over the period of the facility to which it relates. Borrowings are derecognised when
its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within 12 months or less. If
not, they are presented as non-current.


###### 5.5 Financial risk management

Caverion Group is exposed in its business operations to liquidity risk, credit risk, foreign
exchange risk and interest rate risk. The objective of Caverion’s financial risk management is to
minimise the uncertainty which the changes in financial markets cause to its financial
performance.

The year closed with a high market uncertainty, which is reflected to Caverion figures
especially by weaker Norwegian and Swedish krone, as well as higher interest on floating rate
loans. The defining feature of the markets in 2022 has been the inflation and market volatility.
The central banks have fought the inflation with rapid rate increases. Energy prices have been
declining, but there are still risks that the pressure on wage inflation will keep the overall inflation
figures high, thus the interest rate peak and its timing is hard to predict. Continuing high volatility
on foreign exchange rates is also expected. Caverion monitors the risks closely and at the
moment does not see any need for changes in the risk management principles. The risks related
to the availability of financing, the availability of guarantee facilities as well as foreign exchange
and interest rate related risks are in control.

Risk management is carried out by Caverion Group Treasury in co-operation with divisions
under policies approved by the Board of Directors. Financing activities are carried out by finance
personnel and management in the divisions and subsidiaries. Responsibilities in between the
Group Treasury and divisions are defined in the Group’s Treasury Policy. Divisions are
responsible for providing the Group Treasury timely and accurate information on their financial
position, cash flows and foreign exchange position in order to ensure the Group’s efficient cash
and liquidity management, funding and risk management. In addition, the Group’s Treasury
Policy defines main principles and methods for financial risk management, cash management
and specific financing-related areas e.g. commercial guarantees, relationships with financiers
and customer financing.

###### Interest rate risk

Caverion has interest-bearing receivables in its cash and cash equivalents but otherwise its
revenues and cash flows from operating activities are mostly independent of changes in market
interest rates.

Caverion’s exposure to cash flow interest rate risk arises mainly from current and non-current
loans. Borrowing issued at floating interest rates expose Caverion to cash flow interest rate risk.
To manage the interest rate risk, the Board of Directors of Caverion Group has defined an
average interest rate fixing term target for the Group’s net debt (excluding cash). At the reporting
date the average interest rate fixing term of net debt (excluding cash) was 28.1 (13.6) months.
At the end of December 2022 Caverion has not used interest rate derivatives to hedge interest
rate risk.

The weighted average effective interest rate of the whole loan portfolio excluding IFRS 16
effects was 3.0% (2.6%) at the end of December 2022. Fixed-rate loans accounted for
approximately 59 (66) percent of the Group’s borrowings


-----

**Result before taxes**

**2022             2021**


In addition to the targeted average interest rate fixing term of net debt, Caverion Group’s
management monitors regularly the effect of the possible change in interest rate level on the
Group’s financial result. The monitored number is the effect of one percentage point rise in
interest rate level on yearly net interest expenses.


###### Interest rate risk sensitivity

**EUR million**


Interest rate of net debt 1 percentage point higher 0.2 1.0

Net debt includes interest-bearing liabilities and cash and cash equivalents. Sensitivities are
calculated based on the situation at the balance sheet date.

###### Financial counterparty risk

The financial instruments the Group has agreed with its banks and financial institutions contain
a risk of the counterparty being unable to meet its obligations. The Group Treasury is responsible
for the counterparty risk of derivative instruments and financial investment products.

Counterparties to the financial instruments are chosen based on Caverion Group
management’s estimate on their reliability. The Board of Directors of Caverion Group accepts
the main banks used by the Group and counterparties to derivative instruments. CFO accepts
conterparties to short-term investments. Short-term investments related to liquidity management
are made according to Caverion’s Treasury Policy. No impairment has been recognised on
derivative instruments or investment products in the reporting period. Caverion Group’s
management does not expect any credit losses from non-performance by counterparties to
investment products or derivative instruments.

As a result of the partial demerger of YIT Corporation registered on 30 June 2013, a
secondary liability has been generated to Caverion Corporation, a new company established in
the partial demerger, for those liabilities that have been generated before the registration of the
demerger and remain with YIT Corporation after the demerger. Caverion Corporation has a
secondary liability relating to the Group guarantees that remain with YIT Corporation after the
demerger, if YIT Corporation falls into default. These Group guarantees amounted to EUR 20.4
(24.3) million at the end of December 2022.

###### Refinancing and liquidity risk

Refinancing risk is defined as a risk that funds are not available or the costs of refinancing
maturing debt is high at the time a debt needs to be refinanced. The objective of liquidity risk
management is to maintain a sufficient liquidity reserve in all situations. Liquidity and refinancing
risk is managed by diversifying the maturities of external loans and monitoring the proportion of
short-term debt (maturing in less than one year’s time) and the long-term liquidity forecast for
the Group. The Group shall always have liquidity reserve available to meet the need for debt
repayments falling due during the calendar year and to cover the potential funding need over
the planning period of business operations including planned capital expenditure. Adequate
liquidity is maintained by keeping sufficient amount of unused committed credit facilities as a
reserve.

In 2022 Caverion took actions to prolong its loan maturity and strengthen long-term liquidity


-----

99.425 percent. The 5-year bond matures on 25 February 2027 and carries a fixed annual
interest of 2.75 percent. Also, Caverion carried out a tender offer for the EUR 75 million bond
maturing in March 2023 resulting to a EUR 71.5 million acceptance level.

Caverion Group’s interest-bearing loans and borrowings amounted to 144.6 (135.9) million
at the end of December. Approximately 40 percent of the loans have been raised from financial
institutions and 60 percent from investors. The Group’s net debt amounted to EUR 63.4 (5.0)
million at the end of December excluding IFRS 16 effects and EUR 200.9 (140.7) including IFRS
16 effects. At the end of December, the Group’s gearing was 89.1 (69.8) percent and its equity
ratio 19.8 (19.0) percent including IFRS 16 effects. The hybrid bond in amount of EUR 35 million
that Caverion issued in 2020 is an instrument subordinated to the company’s other debt
obligations and treated as equity in the IFRS financial statements. The hybrid bond does not
have a maturity date but the issuer is entitled to redeem the hybrid for the first time on 15 May
2023, and subsequently, on each coupon interest payment date.

Caverion’s external loans are subject to a financial covenant based on the ratio of the
Group’s net debt to EBITDA. The financial covenant shall not exceed 3.5:1. At the end of
December, the Group’s Net debt to EBITDA was 1.3x according to the confirmed calculation
principles.

To manage liquidity risk, Caverion uses cash and cash equivalents, Group accounts with
overdraft facilities, credit facilities and commercial papers. Caverion’s cash and cash equivalents
amounted to EUR 81.2 (130.9) million at the end of December 2022. In addition, Caverion has
undrawn overdraft facilities amounting to EUR 19.7 (19) million and undrawn committed
revolving credit facilities amounting to EUR 100 (100) million. The committed revolving credit
facilities are valid until January 2025.

The following table describes the contractual maturities of financial liabilities. The amounts
are undiscounted. Interest cash flows of floating rate loans and derivative instruments are based
on the interest rates prevailing on December 31, 2022 (December 31, 2021). Cash flows of
foreign currency denominated loans are translated into euro at the reporting date. Cash flows of
foreign currency forward contracts are translated into euro at forward rates.

###### Foreign exchange risk

Caverion Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risks arising from
the currencies of the countries in which it operates. Risk arises mainly from the recognised
assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations. In addition, commercial contracts
in the subsidiaries cause foreign exchange risk, but the contracts are mainly denominated in the
entity’s own functional currencies.

The objective of foreign exchange risk management is to reduce uncertainty caused by
foreign exchange rate movements on income statement through measurement of cash flows
and commercial receivables and payables. By the decision of the Board of Directors of Caverion
Group, the investments in foreign operations are not hedged for foreign exchange translation
risk.

Here net investment comprises equity invested in foreign subsidiaries and internal loans that
qualify for net investment classification deducted by possible goodwill in the subsidiaries balance
sheet.

According to Caverion Group’s Treasury policy, all Group companies are responsible for
identifying and hedging the foreign exchange risk related to the foreign currency denominated
cash flows. All firm commitments of over EUR 0.2 million must be hedged by intra-group
transactions with Group Treasury. Group Treasury hedges the net position with external

consolidated income statement. There were no foreign exchange hedges, which relate to
commercial contracts on the reporting date.

Excluding the foreign exchange differences due to translation risk related to the investments
in foreign operations, the strengthening or weakening of the Euro does not have a significant
impact on the Group’s result. The foreign exchange derivate contracts made for hedging internal
and external loans and receivables offset the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates.

###### 5.6 Derivative instruments

All derivatives are hedges according to Caverion Group’s Treasury Policy, but hedge accounting
as defined in IFRS 9 is not applied for valid derivative contracts. Foreign exchange forward
contracts are mainly designated as hedges of financial items and have been charged to P/L in
finance income/expenses. Foreign exchange forward contracts mature in 2023. There were no
outstanding interest rate swaps in December 2022.

The Group’s derivative instruments are subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting
arrangements or similar agreements. In certain circumstances – e.g. when a credit event such
as a default occurs, all outstanding transactions under the agreement are terminated, the
termination value is assessed and only a single net amount is payable in settlement of all
transactions. Master netting agreements do not meet the criteria for offsetting in the statement
of financial position and amounts are presented on a gross basis. Other financial assets or
liabilities, for example trade receivables or trade payables, do not include any amounts subject
to netting agreements.

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example,
over-the-counter derivatives) is determined by using valuation techniques. These valuation
techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as
possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument
are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. The fair values for the derivative instruments
categorised in Level 2 have been defined as follows: the fair values of foreign exchange forward
and forward rate agreements have been defined by using the market prices at the closing day.
The fair values of interest rate swaps are based on discounted cash flows.

**Accounting principles**
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date Caverion Group becomes party to
an agreement and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value. Directly attributable
transaction costs are recognised in the income statement. The method of recognising the
resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument,
and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. Currency forward contracts are used for hedging
against the currency exposure of exchange rates and resulting changes in fair value are included
in operating profit or financial income and expenses based on their nature in the financial period
in which they were incurred. Interest rate swaps are used to hedge against changes in market
interest rates. Changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps that do not meet the hedge
accounting criteria under IFRS 9, are entered in financing income or expenses in the financial
period in which they were incurred. Derivatives are classified as non-current liabilities when their
contractual maturity is more than 12 months (Other liabilities) and current liabilities when maturity
is less than 12 months (Trade and other payables).

Derivative instruments used in hedge accounting which meet the hedge accounting criteria
under IFRS 9 are entered in the balance sheet at fair value on the day that Caverion Group
becomes counterpart to the agreement. The Group has applied hedge accounting to hedge the
benchmark rate of floating rate loans (cash flow hedging). The Group documents at inception of
the transaction the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instruments and
assesses both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives are
effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items. The effectiveness is assessed at
each balance sheet date at minimum. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of

portion is recognised immediately in the income statement within financial income and expenses.
Gains and losses accumulated in shareholders' equity are reclassified to income statement
within financial income or expenses in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria of
hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity
and is recognised when the forecast transaction occurs. Nevertheless, if the hedged forecast
transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity
is immediately transferred to the income statement within financial income or expense.

Sciences in St. Pölten in Austria, together with the construction company Granit. Project phase
was completed in 2022 and Caverion has taken over the Managed Services and Technical
Maintenance of the property for the next 25 years.

Sales of goods and services sold to associated companies and joint ventures amounted to
EUR 1.3 (1.4) million in 2022.

**Accounting principles**
The consolidated financial statements include associated companies in which the Group either
holds 20%-50% of the voting rights or in which the Group otherwise has significant influence but
not control. Companies where the Group has joint control with another entity are considered as
joint ventures. Investments in associated companies and joint ventures are accounted for using
the equity method: they are initially recorded at cost and the carrying amount is increased or
decreased by Caverion’s share of the profit or loss. The Group determines at each reporting
date whether there is any indication of impairment.

The Group’s share of post-acquisition profit or loss is recognised in the income statement
and its share of post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive income with a
corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment. Dividends received from an
associated company or joint venture reduce the carrying amount of the investment. When the
Group’s share of losses in an associate exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other
unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal
or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. Unrealised gains on
transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s
interest in each associate.

**Multi-employer plan in Sweden**
In Sweden, Caverion participates in a multi-employer defined benefit plan in Alecta insurance
company. 870 employees of Caverion Sverige AB are insured through this pension plan in 2022.
This multi-employer plan has not been able to deliver sufficient information for defined benefit
accounting purposes, thus Caverion has accounted for this pension plan as a contribution plan.

Alecta's possible surplus may be credited to the employer company or to employee. The
expected contributions to the plan for the next annual reporting period are EUR 6.8 million.

Through its defined benefit pension plans the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the
most significant of which are detailed below:

_Changes in bond yields - A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities._
_Inflation risk - some of the Group pension obligations are linked to inflation and higher_
inflation will lead to higher liabilities.

_Life expectancy - The majority of the plans’ obligations are to provide benefits for the life of_
the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans’ liabilities.

**Accounting principles**
Caverion Group has several different pension schemes, both defined benefit and defined
contribution pension plans, in accordance with local regulations and practices in countries where
it operates.

Contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised in the income statement
in the financial period during which the charge is due. Caverion Group has no legal or
constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to
pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current or prior periods.

The Group has defined benefit pension plans in Norway, Austria, Germany and Finland.
Obligations connected with the Group's defined benefit plans are calculated annually by
independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The discount rate used in
calculating the present value of the pension obligation is the market rate of high-quality corporate
bonds. The maturity of the bonds used to determine the reference rate substantially corresponds
to the maturity of the related pension obligation. In defined benefit plans, the pension liability
recognised on the balance sheet is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end
of the reporting period less the fair value of the plan assets. Pension expenditure is expensed in
the income statement, allocating the costs over the employment term of the employees. Actuarial
gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are
charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement.

Occupational pensions in Sweden have been insured under a pension scheme shared with
numerous employers. It has not been possible to acquire sufficient information on these pension
obligation for allocating the liabilities and assets by employers. Occupational pensions in
Sweden have been treated on a defined contribution basis


Discount rate 0.50% decrease 6.8% increase 7.6%

Salary growth rate 0.50% increase 0.2% decrease 0.2%

Pension growth rate 0.50% increase 5.4% decrease 5.0%

**_1)_** _Based on the sensitivity analyses of the Group's most significant pension arrangements. The impacts of the other pension_
_arrangements are similar._

The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other
assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the
assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit
obligations to significant actuarial assumptions the same method has been applied as when
calculating the pension liability recognised within the statement of financial position.

**Plan assets are comprised as follows:**

-----

The present value of pension obligations depends on various factors that are determined on
an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions, including the discount rate. Changes in the
assumptions rate have an effect on the carrying amount of pension obligation. The discount rate
used is the market rate of high-quality corporate bonds or the interest rate of treasury notes for
the currency in which the benefits will be realised. The maturity of the instruments used to
determine the reference rate used corresponds substantially to the maturity of the related
pension obligation. Other assumptions are based on actuarial statistics and prevailing market
conditions.

(EUR 3.4 million) in 2022. The nominal amount of leasing commitments of low-value and shortterm leases amounted to EUR 5.4 million at the end of 2022 (EUR 8.8 million). The present
value of lease liability of leases not yet commenced to which Caverion is committed amounted
to EUR 1.1 million at the end of 2022 (EUR 0.1 million).

The Group has subleased some of its leased premises. The income recognised by the Group
for these premises during the year 2022 was EUR 0.8 million (EUR 0.9 million in 2021).

###### Group as lessor

As a lessor, the Group has finance lease contracts for which the net investment in the balance
sheet amounted to EUR 0.3 million at the end of the year 2022 (EUR 0.3 million). The income
statement effect of these finance lease contracts amounted to EUR 0.1 million in 2022 (EUR 0.0
million) comprising the selling profit of the contract and interest income.

**Accounting principles**
**Group as lessee**
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments,
discounted by using an estimate of the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial
application. Since the interest implicit in the lease contracts is not available, a management
estimate is used to determine the incremental borrowing rate. The components of the rate are
the following: the currency-specific reference rate and the interest margin that is derived from
each individual company’s risk assessment, adjusted to reflect the maturity of the lease contract.

At the inception of the lease, Caverion measures the right-of-use asset at an amount equal
to the lease liability. After the initial measurement, the right-of-use asset is measured at cost less
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment.

Caverion does not recognise an IFRS 16 lease liability for leases for which the underlying
asset is not material The assessment of whether the underlying asset is material and is within


materiality in the Conceptual Framework and IAS 1. Caverion recognises lease payments
associated with such leases as an expense on a straight-line basis.

Caverion does not recognise short-term leases on the balance sheet. Short-term leases are
lease contracts that have a lease term of 12 months or less, and which do not include an option
to purchase the underlying asset. Caverion has analysed lease contracts where the lease term
is not fixed but both the lessor and lessee have an option to terminate the lease within 1-12
months’ notice. Management judgement based on realistic estimates is used when determining
the lease term for short-term leases and leasing agreements with non-fixed terms. If the
termination of the short-term contract is practically realistic within the time of the notice period
(1-12 months), those contracts have been excluded from the lease liability.

As a practical expedient, IFRS 16 permits a lessee not to separate non-lease components
and instead account for a lease and its associated non-lease components as a single
arrangement. Caverion has used the practical expedient for car leases that include service
components. On the other hand, the non-lease component from real estate lease contracts has
been separated and the non-lease components have been booked as expenses.

**Group as lessor**
Under IFRS 16, a lessor classifies arrangements which convey a right to use a specific asset as
either finance leases or operating leases and accounts for these two types of leases differently.
Caverion's lease contracts relate to different types of machinery and equipment which are
installed to operate within the customer's buildings and structures. These lease contracts vary
in terms of conditions.

In finance leases, the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased asset have
substantially transferred from Caverion to the lessee. Sales derived from finance leases are
recognized at the beginning of the lease period in accordance with the same principles as in the
outright sale of similar assets. The net investment in finance leases is recognized as a part of
non-current and current receivables and lease payments are disclosed as repayments of the
finance lease receivable and interest income. The interest income is recognised on the income
statement over the lease term so as to achieve a constant interest rate on the outstanding
balance.

In operating leases, the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased asset remain
with the lessor. The leased assets are recognised on the balance sheet as a part of tangible
assets and depreciated in accordance with the policy applied to similar assets in own use as
well as considering the planned use after the lease period. The lease income from operating
leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term on the income statement.

Under IFRS 16, an intermediate lessor is additionally required to classify its subleases as
finance or operating leases by reference to the right-of-use assets arising from the head lease.
Caverion has not reclassified any of its sublease agreements as finance leases.

The Group’s parent company has guaranteed obligations of its subsidiaries. On December 31,
2022 the total amount of these guarantees was EUR 493.1 (497.7) million. These consist of
counter guarantees for external guarantees and parent company guarantees given according to
general contracting practices.

Given the nature of Caverion’s Projects business, Group companies are involved in disputes
and legal proceedings in several projects. These disputes and legal proceedings typically
concern claims made against Caverion for allegedly defective or delayed delivery. In some
cases, the collection of receivables by Caverion may result in disputes and legal proceedings.
There is a risk that the client presents counter claims in these proceedings. The outcome of
claims, disputes and legal proceedings is difficult to predict. Write-downs and provisions are
booked following the applicable accounting rules.

In June 2018, Caverion reached a settlement for its part with the German Federal Office
(FCO) in a cartel case that had been investigated by the authority since 2014. The investigation
concerned several companies providing technical building services in Germany. Caverion
Deutschland GmbH (and its predecessors) was found to have participated in anti-competitive
practices between 2005 and 2013. According to the FCO’s final decision issued on 3 July 2018,
Caverion Deutschland GmbH was imposed a fine of EUR 40.8 million. In the end of March 2020,
the FCO issued its final decision on the cartel case against the other building technology
companies involved in the matter. There is a risk that civil claims may be presented against the
involved companies, including Caverion Deutschland GmbH. It is not possible to evaluate the
magnitude of the risk for Caverion at this time. Some civil claims presented against Caverion
Deutschland GmbH have been settled in 2022 and 2021, totalling EUR 6.7 and 9.1 million,
respectively.

As part of Caverion’s co-operation with the authorities in the cartel matter, the company
identified activities between 2009 and 2011 that were likely to fulfil the criteria of corruption or
other criminal commitment in one of its client projects executed in that time. Caverion has
brought its findings to the attention of the authorities and supported them in further investigating
the case. In the end of June 2020, the public prosecutor's office in Munich informed Caverion
that no further investigative measures are intended and that no formal fine proceedings against
Caverion will be initiated related to those cases There is a risk that civil claims may be presented
against Caverion Deutschland GmbH. It is not possible to evaluate the magnitude of the risk for


Entities participating in the demerger are jointly and severally responsible for the liabilities of
the demerging entity which have been generated before the registration of the demerger. As a
consequence, a secondary liability up to the allocated net asset value was generated to Caverion
Corporation, incorporated due to the partial demerger of YIT Corporation, for those liabilities that
were generated before the registration of the demerger and remain with YIT Corporation after
the demerger. Creditors of YIT Corporation’s major financial liabilities have waived their right to
claim for settlement from Caverion Corporation on the basis of the secondary liability. Caverion
Corporation has a secondary liability relating to the Group guarantees which remain with YIT
Corporation after the demerger. These Group guarantees amounted to EUR 20.4 (24.3) million
at the end of December 2022.

20% cash allowance calculated from his fixed annual base salary to obtain a pension
coverage by himself. No specific retirement age has been agreed.

Jacob Götzsche was not a participant in Caverion Corporation’s short-term incentive plan

###### 6.2 Share-based payments

Caverion has long-term share-based incentive schemes which are a part of the remuneration
and commitment programme for the management and key personnel of Caverion Group. The
key aim is to align the interests of the shareholders and the executives in order to promote
shareholder value creation and to commit the key executives to the company and its strategic
targets and to offer them a competitive reward plan based on the ownership of the company’s
shares.

Caverion’s Board of Directors approved a rolling long-term share-based incentive plan for
the Group’s senior management and key employees in December 2015. The share-based
incentive plan consists of a Performance Share Plan (PSP) as the main structure,
complemented by a Restricted Share Plan (RSP) structure for specific situations. Both plans
consist of annually commencing individual plans, each lasting a three-year period. The
commencement of each new plan is subject to a separate decision of the Board. Of the plans
depicted below, the performance share plan commencing in 2018 was based on the rolling
incentive structure approved in December 2015. Also all restricted share plans commencing
during years 2018-2022 are based on the rolling structure originally approved in December
2015.

In December 2018, Caverion’s Board of Directors approved the establishment of a new
share-based long-term incentive plan which is based on a performance share plan (PSP)
structure. This new incentive structure consists of annually commencing individual
performance share plans, each with a three-year performance period, which is followed by
the payment of the potentially attained share reward. The performance share plans
commencing during years 2019-2022 are based on the rolling incentive structure approved in
December 2018.


**Share-based long-term incentive plan 2018-2020**
In its December 2017 meeting, Caverion's Board of Directors approved the commencement
of Performance Share Plan 2018-2020 and Restricted Share Plan 2018-2020. The targets for
PSP 2018-2020 were partially met and, in a share issue without consideration, 28,169
Caverion Corporation shares were conveyed to 77 participants during 2021. For RSP 20182020, 35,483 Caverion Corporation shares were conveyed to 16 key employees in 2021.

**Matching Share Plan 2018-2022**
In February 2018, Caverion announced the establishment of a share-based incentive plan
directed at the key employees of the Group, “Matching Share Plan (MSP) 2018−2022”. The
aim of the plan is to align the objectives of the shareholders and the key employees in order
to increase the value of the company in the long-term, to encourage the key employees to
personally invest in the company’s shares, to retain them at the company and to offer them a
competitive reward plan that is based on acquiring, receiving and holding the company’s
shares. The prerequisite for participating in MSP 2018-2022 is that a key employee acquires
company shares up to the number and in the manner determined by the Board of Directors.
The rewards from the plan will be paid in four instalments, one instalment each in 2019, 2020,
2021 and 2022. However, the reward payment will be deferred if the yield of the share has
not reached the pre-set minimum yield level by the end of the matching period in question.
The deferred reward will be paid as soon as practical after the pre-set minimum yield level
has been reached. If the pre-set minimum yield level has not been reached by the end of
reward instalment specific grace periods ending in 2021-2022, no reward from the matching
period in question will be paid. Furthermore, the receiving of the reward is tied to the
continuance of the participant’s employment or service upon reward payment.

The target group of MSP 2018-2022 consists of approximately 20 key executives,
including the members of the Group Management Board. The rewards to be paid on the basis
of the MSP correspond to the value of an approximate maximum total of 2,520,000 Caverion
Corporation shares (including also the portion to be paid in cash). In 2019, Caverion's Board
of Directors decided on share issues without consideration in which 391,469 shares were
conveyed to key employees participating in MSP 2018-2022 as a reward from the matching
period 1 March 2018 - 28 February 2019. A total of 4,431 shares from these issues were
returned to Caverion during 2020. In the spring 2021, 120,199 Caverion Corporation shares
were conveyed as a reward from the matching period 1 March 2018 - 29 February 2020 and,
for participants who joined the plan at a later stage, also as a reward from the matching period
1 March 2018 - 28 February 2019. Additionally, in the fall of 2021, 168,650 Caverion
Corporation shares were conveyed as a reward from the matching period 1 March 2018 - 28
February 2021. From the 2021 share issues, a total of 46,977 shares were returned to
Caverion.

No rewards were paid during 2022 under MSP 2018-2022. However, the Board of
Directors has in December 2022 decided to supplement the terms of the MSP.


-----

the Board maintained full discretion to resolve on any partial or full pay-out under the fourth
instalment under certain conditions.

**Share-based long-term incentive plan 2019-2021**
In December 2018, Caverion's Board of Director's approved the commencement PSP 20192021 and RSP 2019-2021. PSP 2019-2021 could include a maximum of approximately 75
key employees of Caverion Group. The performance target KPI’s were the relative total
shareholder return of the Company’s share and earnings per share. The targets for PSP
2019-2021 were not met and, therefore, no rewards were paid. Within RSP 2019-2021, share
allocations were made for individually selected key employees in special situations. On 24
February 2022, 55,020 Caverion Corporation shares were conveyed in a share issue without
consideration to 22 key employees participating in RSP 2019-2021.

In December 2019, Caverion's Board of Director's approved the commencement PSP 20202022 and RSP 2020-2022. However, on 30 April 2020, the Board decided, upon
management's suggestion, to postpone the commencement of PSP 2020-2022 until the
beginning of the year 2021. PSP 2020-2022 may include a maximum of approximately 90 key
employees of Caverion Group. The performance targets for the plan are the relative total
shareholder return of the Company's share and earnings per share. If all targets are met, the
share rewards based on PSP 2020-2022 will comprise a maximum of approximately 1.6
million Caverion shares (gross before the deduction of applicable taxes). The targets set for
PSP 2020-2022 will be evaluated in the spring of 2023 after which the potential share rewards
will be delivered to the participants.

Within RSP 2020-2022, share allocations are made for individually selected key
employees in special situations. The maximum number of shares that may be allocated and
delivered totals 230,000 shares (gross before the deduction of applicable taxes). The share
rewards will be delivered to the participants in spring 2023 provided that their employment
with Caverion continues until the delivery of the share reward.

**Share-based long-term incentive plan 2021-2023**
Caverion’s Board of Directors approved in December 2020 the commencement of PSP 20212023 and RSP 2021-2023. PSP 2021–2023 may include a maximum of approximately 90 key
employees of Caverion Group. The performance targets for the plan are the relative total
shareholder return of the Company’s share and earnings per share. If all targets will be met,
the share rewards based on PSP 2021–2023 will comprise a maximum of approximately 1.6
million Caverion shares (gross before the deduction of applicable taxes) delivered in the
spring of 2024.

The public tender offers made for Caverion’s shares can have an effect on the payments made
under Caverion’s outstanding share incentive plans. Additional information on the possible
effects can be found in North Holdings 3 Oy’s tender offer document published on 24 November
2022.

**Accounting principles**
Caverion's share-based incentive plans, which include a net settlement feature, are in principle
accounted for as fully equity settled plans even though Caverion pays the withholding taxes in
cash on behalf of the participants. The share-based incentive plans are valued at their fair value
on grant date and are recognised as an employee benefit expense over the vesting period with
corresponding entry in equity. The difference realised upon the settlement date is also accounted
for against equity.

Insofar as the decision regarding the settlement method of the share-based incentive plans
is outside of Caverion's discretion, the company's management has had to utilise its judgement
based on the information available at the time. Caverion has estimated the effect of the public
tender offers and other available information on the share-based incentive plans and their
classification at the reporting date. Based on these estimates, Caverion has not deemed it
necessary to change the classification used in the treatment of the share-based incentive plans
from the previously applied treatment.

The fair value of the share-based rewards is based on the market price of Caverion
Corporation's share at the grant date. Some of Caverion's share-based incentive plans also
contain market-based vesting conditions which are taken into consideration when determining
the fair value of the reward at grant date. For these, the reward's fair value is determined by
utilising the Monte Carlo simulation which reflects also the probability of not achieving the
market-based vesting condition. For the market-based vesting conditions, the expense is
recognised regardless of whether the condition is, in the end, satisfied. For non-market-based
vesting conditions, the achievement of the condition is taken into account in the number of
shares which are expected to vest at the end of the vesting period.

###### 6.3 Related party transactions

Caverion announced in February 2018 the establishment of a new share-based incentive plan
directed for the key employees of the Group (“Matching Share Plan 2018-2022”). The company
provided the participants a possibility to finance the acquisition of the company’s shares through
an interest-bearing loan from the company, which some of the participants utilised. By the end
of December 2022 the total outstanding amount of these loans amounted to approximately EUR
3.7 (4.4) million. The loans will be repaid in full on 29 December 2023, at the latest. Company
shares have been pledged as a security for the loans. As a result, Caverion had 623,122
Caverion Corporation shares as a pledge at the end of the reporting period on 31 December


Share-based incentive plans have been described in more detail in note 6.2 Share-based
payments.

###### Auditor’s report (Translation of the Finnish original)

**To the Annual General Meeting of Caverion Oyj**


###### REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Caverion Oyj
(business identity code 2534127-4) for the year ended 31
December 2022. The financial statements comprise the
consolidated balance sheet, income statement, statement of
comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity,
statement of cash flows and notes, including a summary of
significant accounting policies, as well as the parent company’s
balance sheet, income statement, statement of cash flows and
notes.

In our opinion

   - the consolidated financial statements give a true and
fair view of the group’s financial position as well as its
financial performance and its cash flows in
accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU.

   - the financial statements give a true and fair view of
the parent company’s financial performance and
financial position in accordance with the laws and
regulations governing the preparation of financial
statements in Finland and comply with statutory
requirements.

Our opinion is consistent with the additional report submitted to
the Audit Committee.


###### Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with good auditing
practice in Finland. Our responsibilities under good auditing
practice are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities
_for the Audit of Financial Statements section of our report._

We are independent of the parent company and of the
group companies in accordance with the ethical requirements
that are applicable in Finland and are relevant to our audit, and
we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance
with these requirements.

In our best knowledge and understanding, the non-audit
services that we have provided to the parent company and
group companies are in compliance with laws and regulations
applicable in Finland regarding these services, and we have
not provided any prohibited non-audit services referred to in
Article 5 (1) of regulation (EU) 537/2014. The non-audit
services that we have provided have been disclosed in note
2.2 to the consolidated financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

###### Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial
statements of the current period. These matters were
addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements
as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not
provide a separate opinion on these matters.


We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the
_Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial_
_statements section of our report, including in relation to these_
matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of
procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks
of material misstatement of the financial statements. The
results of our audit procedures, including the procedures
performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for
our audit opinion on the accompanying financial statements.

We have also addressed the risk of management override
of internal controls. This includes consideration of whether
there was evidence of management bias that represented a
risk of material misstatement due to fraud.

###### Key audit matter How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter


###### Revenue recognition

_The accounting principles and disclosures concerning revenue recognition are disclosed in_
_Note 2.1._

In accordance with its accounting principles Caverion applies the percentage-of-completion

method for recognizing significant portion of its revenues.

The recognition of revenue by applying percentage-of-completion method and the

estimation of the outcome of projects require significant management judgment in estimating
the cost-to-complete as well as total revenues. From the financial statement perspective,
significant judgment is required especially when the project execution and the associated
revenues extend over two or more financials years.

The areas where significant judgment is required are more prone to the risk that the

assumptions may be deliberately misappropriated. Based on above, revenue recognition was
a key audit matter. This matter was also a significant risk of material misstatement referred to
in EU Regulation No 537/2014, point (c) of Article 10(2).


Our audit procedures to address the risk of material misstatement included:

   - Assessing of the Group’s accounting policies over revenue recognition of projects.

   - Examination of the project documentation such as contracts, legal opinions and other
written communication.

   - Analytical procedures and review of financial KPI’s as well as development of projects
by

       - reviewing the changes in estimated total revenues, cost-to-complete and
changes in reserves, and

       - discussing with the different levels of the organization including project,
division and group management.

   - Analyzing key elements in management’s estimates such as the estimated future
costs-to-complete and the estimated time necessary to complete the project.

   - Evaluating the appropriateness of the Group’s disclosures in respect of revenue
recognition.


###### Key audit matter How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter


###### Valuation of goodwill associated with German business operations

_The accounting principles and disclosures concerning goodwill are disclosed in Note 4.2._

The valuation of goodwill associated with German business operations was a key audit

matter

    - because the assessment process is judgmental, it is based on assumptions
relating to market or economic conditions extending to the future,

    - because of the significance of the goodwill 77,7 million euro to the financial
statements, and

    - as the management views that a reasonably possible change in key assumption
may result in an impairment.

German business operations form a one cash generating unit. The valuation of goodwill is

based on the management’s estimate about the value-in-use calculations of the cash
generating unit. There are number of underlying assumptions used to determine the value-inuse, including the revenue growth, EBITDA and discount rate applied on net cash-flows.

Estimated value-in-use may vary significantly when the underlying assumptions are

changed and the changes in above-mentioned individual assumptions may result in an
impairment of goodwill.


Our audit procedures regarding the valuation of goodwill in German business operation
included involving EY valuation specialists to assist us in evaluating testing methodologies,
impairment calculations and underlying assumptions applied by the management in the
impairment testing.

In evaluation of methodologies, we compared the principles applied by the management in

the impairment tests to the requirements set in IAS 36 Impairment of assets standard and
ensured the mathematical accuracy of the impairment calculations associated with German
business operations.

The key assumptions applied by the management were compared to

    - approved budgets and forecasts,

    - information available in external sources, as well as

    - our independently calculated industry averages such as weighted average cost of
capital used in discounting the cashflows.

We also assessed the sufficiency of the disclosures associated with the German business

operations.


-----

   - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding
the financial information of the entities or business
activities within the group to express an opinion on the
consolidated financial statements. We are

responsible for the direction, supervision and
performance of the group audit. We remain solely
responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing
of the audit and significant audit findings, including any
significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during
our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence, and communicate with
them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably
be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable,
related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with
governance, we determine those matters that were of most
significance in the audit of the financial statements of the
current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We
describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or
when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a
matter should not be communicated in our report because the
adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be
expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such
communication.

###### Other Reporting Requirements Information on our audit engagement

We were first appointed as auditors by the Annual General
Meeting on 26 March 2018, and our appointment represents a
total period of uninterrupted engagement of 5 years.

###### Other information

The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are
responsible for the other information. The other information


###### Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director for the Financial Statements

The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are
responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial
statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted
by the EU, and of financial statements that give a true and fair
view in accordance with the laws and regulations governing the
preparation of financial statements in Finland and comply with
statutory requirements. The Board of Directors and the
Managing Director are also responsible for such internal
control as they determine is necessary to enable the
preparation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the Board of Directors
and the Managing Director are responsible for assessing the
parent company’s and the group’s ability to continue as going
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters relating to going
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting. The
financial statements are prepared using the going concern
basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the
parent company or the group or cease operations, or there is
no realistic alternative but to do so.

###### Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance on whether
the financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an
auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee
that an audit conducted in accordance with good auditing
practice will always detect a material misstatement when it
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of
users taken on the basis of the financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with good auditing



- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement
of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or
error, design and perform audit procedures

responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,

misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the parent company’s or the group’s internal
control.

- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies
used and the reasonableness of accounting

estimates and related disclosures made by

management.

- Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of
Directors’ and the Managing Director’s use of the
going concern basis of accounting and based on the
audit evidence obtained, whether a material

uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that
may cast significant doubt on the parent company’s
or the group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we
are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report
to the related disclosures in the financial statements
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our
opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit
evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s
report. However, future events or conditions may
cause the parent company or the group to cease to
continue as a going concern.

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and
content of the financial statements, including the
disclosures, and whether the financial statements
represent the underlying transactions and events so


-----

the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. We
have obtained the report of the Board of Directors prior to the
date of this auditor’s report, and the Annual Report is expected
to be made available to us after that date.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the
other information.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our
responsibility is to read the other information identified above
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is
materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our
knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be
materially misstated. With respect to report of the Board of
Directors, our responsibility also includes considering whether


the report of the Board of Directors has been prepared in
accordance with the applicable laws and regulations.

In our opinion, the information in the report of the Board of
Directors is consistent with the information in the financial
statements and the report of the Board of Directors has been
prepared in accordance with the applicable laws and
regulations.

If, based on the work we have performed on the other
information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s
report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this
other information, we are required to report that fact. We have
nothing to report in this regard.

Alternative performance measures

ESMA (European Securities and Markets Authority) has issued guidelines regarding Alternative Performance Measures (“APM”). Caverion presents APMs to improve the analysis of business
and financial performance and to enhance the comparability between reporting periods. APMs presented in this report should not be considered as a substitute for measures of performance in
accordance with the IFRS.


EBITDA = Operating profit (EBIT) + depreciation, amortisation and impairment Organic growth = Defined as the change in revenue in local currencies excluding the
impacts of (i) currencies; and (ii) acquisitions and divestments. The

Adjusted EBITDA = EBITDA before items affecting comparability (IAC) [1)]

currency impact shows the impact of changes in exchange rates of

EBITA = Operating profit (EBIT) + amortisation and impairment subsidiaries with a currency other than the euro (Group’s reporting

currency). The acquisitions and divestments impact shows how

Adjusted EBITA = EBITA before items affecting comparability (IAC) [1)] acquisitions and divestments completed during the current or

previous year affect the revenue reported. However, the change in
the revenue of the acquired businesses post-acquisition is included in
organic growth.

1) Items affecting comparability (IAC) in 2023 are material items or transactions, which are relevant for understanding the financial performance of Caverion when comparing the profit of the
current period with that of the previous periods. These items can include (1) capital gains and/or losses and transaction costs related to divestments and acquisitions; (2) write-downs, expenses
and/or income from separately identified major risk projects; (3) restructuring expenses and (4) other items that according to Caverion management’s assessment are not related to normal
business operations. In 2022, major risk projects only included one old risk project in Germany reported under category (2). In 2022 and 2023, provisions and legal and other costs for civil claims
related to the German anti-trust matter were reported under category (4). Category (4) included also costs related to the submitted public tender offers in 2022 and 2023.

Adjusted EBITDA is affected by the same adjustments as adjusted EBITA, except for restructuring costs, which do not include depreciation and impairment relating to restructurings.

Caverion Corporation is domiciled in Helsinki, Finland and its registered address is Torpantie
2, 01650 Vantaa, Finland. The company’s shares are listed on the NASDAQ OMX Helsinki Ltd
as of July 1, 2013. The copies of the consolidated financial statements are available at
www.caverion.com or at the parent company’s head office, Torpantie 2, 01650 Vantaa, Finland.

On June 30, 2013, the partial demerger of Building Systems business (the “demerger”) of YIT
Corporation became effective. At this date, all of the assets and liabilities directly related to
Building Systems business were transferred to Caverion Corporation, a new company
established in the partial demerger.

These consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors
in their meeting on 7 February 2024 after which, in accordance with Finnish Company Law, the
financial statements are either approved, amended or rejected in the Annual General Meeting.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the basis of
preparation and accounting policies set out below.

The consolidated financial statements of Caverion Corporation have been prepared in
accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the
European Union observing the standards and interpretations effective on December 31, 2023.
The notes to the consolidated financial statements also comply with the requirements of Finnish
accounting and corporate legislation complementing the IFRS regulation.

The figures in these consolidated financial statements are presented in million euros, unless
stated otherwise. Rounding differences may occur.

Caverion Group’s consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended 2023 have
been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for investments, financial assets and
liabilities at fair value through profit and loss and derivative instruments at fair value.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain
critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the
process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of
judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the
consolidated financial statements are disclosed under “Critical accounting estimates and
judgements” below.


###### Consolidation

 Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and
operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than 50% of the voting rights.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible
are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully
consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated
from the date that control ceases.

The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The total
consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets
transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by Caverion Group. The total
consideration includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent
consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable
assets acquired, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are
measured initially at their fair value at the acquisition date. On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis,
the Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the
non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s assets.

Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions
between Group companies are eliminated.

###### Disposal of subsidiaries

When the Group ceases to have control, any remaining interest in the entity is re-measured to
its fair value at the date when control is lost, with the change in the carrying amount recognised
through profit and loss. In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive
income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if realised and recognised in the income
statement. If the interest is reduced but control is retained, only a proportionate share of the
amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are booked to non-controlling
interest in equity.

###### Transactions with non-controlling interests

The Group accounts transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control
as equity transactions. The difference between the fair value of any consideration paid and the
relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity.
Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.


-----

###### Critical accounting estimates and judgements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make
estimates and exercise judgement in the application of the accounting policies. Estimates and
judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and expectations
of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The resulting
accounting estimates may deviate from the related actual results. The estimates and
assumptions that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below. Accounting estimates
and judgements are commented in more detail in connection with each item.

   - Goodwill

   - Acquisitions and disposals

   - Revenue from contracts with customers

   - Income taxes

   - Provisions

   - Employee benefit obligations

   - Trade receivables

###### Foreign currency translation and transactions

Items included in the consolidated financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are
measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates
(the functional currency). These consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which
is the Group’s presentation currency.

The income statements of foreign Group companies are translated into euro using the
average exchange rate for the reporting period. The balance sheets are translated at the closing
rate at the date of that balance sheet. Translating the result for the period using different
exchange rates in the income statement and balance sheet results in a translation difference,
which is recognised in other comprehensive income.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated
as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. Exchange
differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income. When a foreign subsidiary is
disposed of or sold, exchange differences that were recorded in equity are recognised in the
income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange
rates prevailing on the date of transaction or valuation, where items are re-measured. Foreign
exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the


translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are recognised in the income statement. Foreign exchange gains and losses that
relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the income statement within
“Finance income and expenses”. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in
the income statement above operating profit. Non-monetary items are mainly measured at the
exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction date.

Caverion Group applies exchange rates published by the European Central Bank in the
consolidated financial statements. Exchange rates used in euros:

###### Operating segments

The profitability of Caverion Group has been presented as one operating segment from 1 January
2014 onwards. The chief operating decision-maker of Caverion is the Board of Directors. Due to
the management structure of Caverion, nature of its operations and its business areas, Group is
the relevant reportable operating segment.

###### New standards and amendments adopted

 Evaluation of the future impact of new standards and interpretations

Caverion has adopted the new standards and interpretations that were effective during the
accounting period and are relevant to its operations. These amendments had no impact on the
consolidated financial statements of Caverion. A number of new standards and amendments to
standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2023,
and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements. The Group is
not expecting a significant impact of those to the consolidated financial statements.

The disaggregation of revenue is set out below by Business Units and by division. The
reportable segment of Caverion is the Group and thus, no reconciliation between segments
and revenue from contracts with customers is presented.

Caverion’s Projects business as a whole, the market demand has remained mostly stable,
however, with regional differences.

Caverion carried out five acquisitions during the year and revenue increased by 4.1 (2.2)
percent as a result of acquisitions and divestments.

**EUR million** **12/31/2023** **12/31/2022**

**Contract assets**
POC receivables 236.3 231.3

Work in progress 4.1 7.5

**Contract liabilities**

Advances received [1)] 273.2 286.2

Accrued expenses from long-term contracts 28.8 28.7

1) Advances received consist of advances received in cash and advances relating to percentage of completion method.

Amounts included in the contract liabilities at the beginning of the year are mainly recognised
as revenue during the financial year. Revenue recognised from performance obligations
satisfied in the previous years was not material in 2023 or 2022.

###### Performance obligations

A performance obligation is a distinct good or service within a contract that customer can
benefit on stand-alone basis.

In Projects and Services business, performance obligation is satisfied by transferring
control of a work delivered to a customer. At Caverion, control is transferred mainly over time
and payment is generally due within 14-45 days.

In most of the contracts that Caverion has with its customers only one performance
obligation is identified. Many contracts include different building systems (e.g. heating,
sanitation, ventilation, air conditioning and electricity) that the customer has ordered from
Caverion. All the different building systems (i.e. disciplines) could be distinct, because the
customer could benefit from those on their own or together with other resources that are
readily available. However, those are not concluded to be distinct in the context of the contract
while based on the management’s view, the customer has wanted to get all the building
systems as a whole and the customer has requested for all technical solutions / services as
one package. In addition, Caverion provides also project management services and is


Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised mainly over time.

Revenue increased in both Business units, Services business revenue increased by 3.2
percent and Projects business unit revenue by 11.3 percent. Revenue increased in all
divisions except Norway and Industry. Caverion has managed in all material aspects to cover
material cost increases in pricing. In Services, the market demand and general investment
activity remained positive. Caverion has continued to see an increasing interest towards longterm and large-scale service agreements, driven by the demand for technical competencies
and self-delivery capability. In Projects, the increasing interest rates have as much as stalled
certain segments of the building construction market. Caverion is not immune to this
development. The residential construction market, however, does not have a significant role
in Caverion’s Projects business portfolio. On the other hand, the demand in certain other
businesses, such as renewable energy related projects, has been strong. As such, for

total deliverable / combined output to the customer, which has been agreed in the contract
and from the commercial point there are no separable risks related to the different parts of the
project, as the project has one total price for the full delivery and possible sanctions are defined
at the contract level.

In Services business performance obligations are maintenance agreements and separate
repair orders which are distinct. Caverion has lifecycle contracts, where maintenance phases
are recognised over time as separate performance obligations. During the maintenance
period, Caverion receives payments on a monthly basis. The consideration of the
maintenance periods are tied to the maintenance index. Revenue is recognised under
percentage of completion method and the stage of completion of these contracts are
measured by reference to the contract costs incurred up to the end of the reporting period as
a percentage of total estimated costs for the contract.

###### Remaining performance obligations

The transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations (unsatisfied or
partially unsatisfied) as at 31 December is as follows:

**EUR million** **2023** **2022**

Within one year 1,114.6 1,228.7

More than one year 794.1 714.6

**Total (order backlog)** **1,908.7** **1,943.3**

**Accounting principles**
Income from the sale of products and services is recognised as revenue at fair value net of
indirect taxes and discounts.

Revenue from sales of goods is recorded when the significant risks and rewards and
control associated with the ownership of the goods have been transferred to the buyer.
Revenue for sales of short-term services is recognised in the accounting period in which the
services are rendered. Revenue is recognised when, or as, the customer obtains control of
the goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects
to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.

Contracts under percentage of completion method are recognised as revenue on the stage
of completion basis when the outcome of the project can be estimated reliably. The stage of
completion of these contracts are measured by reference to the contract costs incurred up to
the end of the reporting period as a percentage of total estimated costs for the contract or
evaluated based on physical stage of completion. Invoicing which exceeds the revenue
recognised based on the stage of completion is recognised in advances received. Invoicing
which is less than the revenue recognised on the percentage of completion basis is deferred
and presented as related accrued income. Costs in excess of the stage of completion are


capitalised as work in progress and costs below the stage of completion are recorded as
accrued expenses from long-term contracts.

Due to estimates included in the revenue recognition of contracts under percentage of
completion method, revenue and profit presented by financial period only rarely correspond to
the equal distribution of the total profit over the duration of the project. When revenue
recognition is based on the percentage of completion method, the outcome of the projects and
contracts is regularly and reliably estimated. Calculation of the total income of projects involves
estimates on the total costs required to complete the project as well as on the development of
billable work. If the estimates regarding the outcome of a contract change, the revenue and
result recognised are adjusted in the reporting period when the change first becomes known
and can be estimated. If it is probable that the total costs required to complete a contract will
exceed the total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense
immediately.

Revenue is recognised from any variable consideration at its estimated amount, if it is
highly probable that no significant reversal of revenue will occur.

Caverion’s customer contracts do not usually include any significant financing
components.

The Group can also carry out a pre-agreed single project or a long-term service agreement
through a construction consortium. The construction consortium is not a separate legal entity.
The participating companies usually have a joint responsibility. Projects and service
agreements performed by the consortium are included in the reporting of the Group company
and revenue is recognised on the stage of completion basis according to the Group company’s
share in the consortium.

Caverion’s Board of Directors approved the establishment of a cash-based long-term incentive
plan (“LTI cash plan”) that was effective from January 1, 2023. This plan functions as a
performance and cash-based long-term incentive scheme for selected members of the
management and selected key employees of Caverion Group. The performance period
(earning period) is one year and outcome (reward amount) is confirmed to the participants in
second year after the financial statements have been confirmed. The performance period is
followed by a two-year retention period, extending until the end of the third calendar year of
the plan. In 2023, the Board of Directors decided that all costs of the plan (in total EUR 5.7
million) were booked for 2023 and that the exact payment date will be decided later. These
costs are reported as part of wages and salaries in the above table.

The Group's effective tax rate increased to 45.4 (24.1) percent in January–December 2023.
The comparable effective tax rate, without the impact of change of control related (due to
Triton take-over) tax asset revaluation, decreased to 14.4 percent. Comparably low tax rate
was mainly due to profitability improvement in subsidiaries with carry-forward tax losses.

Pillar Two legislation has been enacted or substantively enacted in certain jurisdictions in
which the Group operates. The legislation will affect the Group’s financial reporting period
starting 1 January 2024. Currently Caverion is assessing the potential exposure arising from
Pillar Two legislation.

Based on the assessment carried out so far, the Pillar Two effective tax rates in most of the
jurisdictions in which the Group operates are above 15 percent or the safe harbour relief is
met. However, there are limited number of jurisdictions where the transitional safe harbour


Caverion does not expect material Pillar Two income “top-up” taxes although there might be
potential exposures for operating subsidiaries in certain jurisdictions. The Group continues to
progress on the assessment and expects to complete the assessment in 2024.

**Accounting principles**
Tax expenses in the income statement comprise current and deferred taxes. Taxes are
recognised in the income statement except when they are associated with items recognised
in other comprehensive income or directly in shareholders' equity. Current taxes are calculated
on the taxable income on the basis of the tax rate stipulated for each country by the balance
sheet date. Taxes are adjusted for the taxes of previous financial periods, if applicable.
Management evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which
applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. The tax provisions recognised in such
situations are based on evaluations by management. Evaluating the total amount of income
taxes at the Group level requires significant judgement, so the amount of total tax includes
uncertainty.

**Earnings per share, basic, EUR** **0.24** **0.32**

Earnings per share adjusted with items related to the tender offer process was EUR 0.52

**Accounting principles**
Earnings per share is calculated by dividing the result for the financial year attributable to the
owners of the parent company (adjusted with the paid hybrid capital expenses and interests
and accrued unrecognised interest after tax) by the weighted average number of shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the
number of shares to assume conversion of all diluting potential shares. There were no diluting
effects in 2023 and 2022.

The Group did not make any material write-downs in inventories in 2023 or 2022.

**Accounting principles**
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The acquisition cost of
materials and supplies is determined using the weighted average cost formula. The acquisition
cost of work in progress comprises the value of materials, direct costs of labour, other direct
costs and a systematic allocation of the variable manufacturing overheads and fixed overhead.
The net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the course of ordinary business less
the estimated cost of completion and the estimated cost to make the sale.

**Operational credit risk of receivables**
Caverion’s operational credit risk arises from outstanding receivable balances and long-term
agreements with customers. Customer base and the nature of commercial contracts are
different in each country, and local teams are responsible for ongoing monitoring of customerspecific credit risk. The exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.

The Group manages credit risk relating to operating items, for instance, by advance
payments, upfront payment programs in projects, payment guarantees and careful
assessment of the credit quality of the customer. Majority of Caverion Group’s operating
activities are based on established, reliable customer relationships and generally adopted
contractual terms. The payment terms of the invoices are mainly from 14 to 45 days. Credit
background of new customers is assessed comprehensively and when necessary, guarantees
are required and client’s paying behavior is monitored actively. Caverion Group does not have
any significant concentrations of credit risk as the clientele is widespread and geographically
spread into the countries in which the Group operates.

The Group’s largest overdue trade receivables relate to legal cases of old projects, for
which there exist separate legal opinions justifying the validity of the receivables. Caverion
Group did not experience any major unexpected credit losses in 2023. Group management
also critically assessed the level of the expected credit loss accrual in accordance with IFRS


-----

9 at year-end closing and it was assessed to be sufficient. Overall, Group management
assessed the Group’s credit risk position to be at about previous year’s level.

Credit losses and impairment of receivables amounted to EUR -2.0 (-0.3) million. The
Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date (December 31, 2023) is
the carrying amount of the financial assets. There are EUR 18.2 (24.9) million overdue
receivables that are more than 180 days old. Receivables and the related risk are monitored
on a regular basis and risk assessments are updated always when there are changes in
circumstances. The receivable is impaired if payment is considered unlikely.

Current receivables include operative risks which are described in more detail in the Board
of Directors’ Report.

**Accounting principles**
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for merchandise sold or services
performed in the ordinary course of business. If collection is expected in 12 months or less,
they are classified as current. If not, they are presented as non-current.

The Group recognises an impairment loss on receivables when there is objective evidence
that payment is not expected to occur. Recognised impairment loss includes estimates and
critical judgements. The estimates are based on historical credit losses, past practice of credit
management, client specific analysis and economic conditions at the assessment date. In
addition to impairment losses recognised based on the evidence that the receivable cannot
be collected in full, IFRS 9 establishes a new model for recognition and measurement of
impairments in loans and receivables - the so-called expected credit losses model. Caverion
has chosen to apply a simplified credit loss matrix for trade receivables as the trade
receivables do not contain significant financing components. The provision matrix is based on
an entity’s historical default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables and is adjusted
for forward-looking estimates. The lifetime expected credit loss provision is calculated by
multiplying the gross carrying amount of outstanding trade receivables by an expected default
rate. Changes in expected credit losses are recognised in other operating expenses in the
consolidated income statement.

If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease
can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the
previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through the income statement.


Due to the application of the percentage of completion method, part of reliably estimated
impairment losses are included in the cost estimate of a project and considered as weakened
margin forecast. Therefore impairment losses of trade receivables in onerous projects are
included in the loss reserve.

The recognition of provisions involves estimates concerning probability, time of realization and quantity. As of December 31, 2023 the provisions amounted to EUR 37.4 (38.1) million.


**Accounting principles**
Provisions are recorded when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation on the basis of a
past event, the realisation of the payment obligation is probable and the amount of the obligation
can be reliably estimated. Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditure
required to settle the obligation. If reimbursement for some or all of the obligations can be
received from a third party, the reimbursement is recorded as a separate asset, but only when it
is practically certain


that said reimbursement will be received. Provisions are recognised for onerous contracts when
the unavoidable costs required to meet obligations exceed the benefits expected to be received
under the contract. The amount of the warranty provision is set on the basis of experience of the
realisation of these commitments.

Provisions for restructuring are recognised when the Group has made a detailed restructuring
plan and initiated the implementation of the plan, or has communicated of it.

**_1)_** _Capitalisation of intangible assets include, besides capitalisation of intangible assets, the deductible amount of the deferred taxes_

_of goodwill from the separate entities._


-----

**Accounting principles**
Deferred taxes are calculated on all temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. No deferred taxes are calculated
on goodwill impairment that is not deductible in taxation and no deferred taxes are recognised
on the undistributed profits of subsidiaries to the extent that the difference is unlikely to be reverse
in the foreseeable future. Deferred taxes have been calculated using the statutory tax rates or
the tax rates substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are only
recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which
the temporary difference can be utilized.

The most significant temporary differences arise from differences between the recognised
revenue from long-term contracts using the percentage of completion method and taxable
income, measurement at fair value in connection with business combinations and unused tax
losses.


Deferred tax assets on taxable losses are booked to the extent the benefit is expected to be
possible to deduct from the taxable profit in the future. Deferred tax liability on undistributed
earnings of subsidiaries, where the tax will be paid on the distribution of earnings, has not been
recognised in the statement of financial position, because distribution of the earnings is in the
control of the Group and it is not probable in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against
current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income
taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable
entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.

buildings. The acquisition complemented Caverion's service capacity in the region and
strengthened its market position.

On 30 November 2022, Caverion closed on an agreement to acquire the shares of the Finnish
LukkoPro Oy. LukkoPro specialises in locking and safety services and its digital services offering
includes the EasyKey automated key management service. The acquisition broadened
Caverion's offering in smart security services.

On 1 December 2022, Caverion closed on an agreement to acquire Carrier's food retail
refrigeration business in Finland. The acquisition strengthened Caverion's refrigeration business
and expertise and also brought Carrier's market-leading food refrigeration product portfolio to
Caverion's offering.

On 31 December 2022, Caverion acquired Metsä Fibre Oy's shares in Oy Botnia Mill Service
Ab (50.17%) as a part of an arrangement where Metsä Fibre took over the maintenance
operations of their pulp mills and the Rauma sawmill as well as the related workshop and design
services. These operations were previously performed by Oy Botnia Mill Service Ab, a joint
venture company owned by the parties. Apart from the share purchase, the transaction was
treated as a termination of an outsourcing agreement.

On 27 October 2022, Caverion signed an agreement to acquire TM Voima Group’s substation
and transmission line business in Finland and Estonia. The acquisition strengthens Caverion’s
presence in the energy sector and enable growth especially in the substation business. In 2021,
the revenue of TM Voima Group’s substation and transmission line business amounted to EUR
30.5 million and the number of employees was 66. The closing of the acquisition was subject to
the approval by the Finnish Competition and Consumer Authority and the acquisition was
completed on 1 February 2023.

**Accounting principles**
Caverion applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The total
consideration transferred for the acquisition is the fair value of the assets transferred, the
liabilities incurred and the possible equity interests issued by Caverion Group The total


consideration includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent
consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable
assets acquired, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are
measured initially at their fair value at the acquisition date. The measurement of the fair values
requires management judgement and is based partly on management's estimates.

The consolidation of the acquired businesses in accordance with IFRS 3 is still provisional as
of 31 December 2023. Therefore, the fair value measurement of the assets and liabilities
acquired during 2023 is preliminary and subject to adjustments during the 12-month period during
which the acquisition calculations will be finalized.

###### Year 2023

On 16 December 2023, Caverion sold the CalVan business in Sweden to C. Persson
Hyrmaskiner AB. CalVan is Sweden's largest renter and retailer of tools and machines for
industrial projects, plumbing contracts and service work. The sale of business did not have a
material effect on Caverion's profitability. The transaction price was not disclosed.

###### Year 2022

On 28 December 2022, Caverion sold the shares of ALEA GmbH to Avalon GmbH. ALEA
provides soft facility services in Austria and was transferred to Caverion's ownership in the
August 2022 acquisition of the PORREAL Group. ALEA employed 230 persons at the time of the
divestment and its revenue for the time in Caverion's ownership amounted to EUR 4.2 million.
The divestment did not have a material effect on Caverion's profitability. The transaction price
was not disclosed. The transaction costs were expensed during the fiscal year and were not
material in value.

###### 4.2 Goodwill

 Goodwill is allocated to the cash generating units (CGU) as follows:

Finland 97.6 96.4

Germany 77.7 77.7

Norway 73.2 72.3

Sweden 50.2 49.1

Austria 42.9 42.8

Denmark 33.7 32.7

**Total goodwill** **465.3** **442.5**

In 2023, Caverion completed five acquisitions, the largest of which was the acquisition of TM
Voima Group. In 2023 Goodwill increased by EUR 22.8 million and the goodwill arising from the
2023 acquisitions amounted to EUR 21.7 million and was mainly attributable to personnel knowhow, expected synergies and geographical coverage.

In 2022, Caverion completed 12 acquisitions, the largest of which were the acquisitions of
the Austrian PORREAL Group and the Danish DI-Teknik A/S and CS electric A/S. In 2022
Goodwill increased by EUR 72.6 million and the goodwill arising from the 2022 acquisitions


amounted to EUR 73.2 million and was mainly attributable to personnel know-how, expected
synergies and geographical coverage.

Goodwill is reviewed for potential impairment whenever there is an indication that the current
value may be impaired, or at least annually. Impairment testing of goodwill is carried out by
allocating goodwill to the lowest cash generating unit level (CGU) which generates independent
cash flows. The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units (CGU) are determined on the
basis of value-in-use calculations. The future cash flow projections are based on the budget
approved by the top management and the Board of Directors and other long-term financial plans.
After this there is a critical assessment of the cash flows related to the goodwill impairment
testing. Cash flow projections cover two years, the terminal value is defined by extrapolating it
on the basis of average development during the forecasted planning horizon. Cash flows beyond
the forecast period are projected by using 1.75 percent long-term growth rate that is based on a
prudent estimate about the long-term growth rate and inflation. Future growth estimates are
based on the former experience and information available by external market research
institutions on market development.

The discount rate used in the impairment testing is the weighted average pre-tax cost of
capital (WACC). The discount rate reflects the total cost of equity and debt and the market risks
related to the segment. The country-specific WACC components are: the risk-free interest rate,
the market risk premium and the credit spread. The common components for all tested CGUs
are; the comparable peer industry beta, the Group capital structure and the size premium based
on Caverion Group's size.

Estimating the future cash flows of CGUs has been challenging in 2023 due to the war in
Ukraine and there-related uncertainty in the economic environment. As part of the goodwill
impairment testing, management cautiously assessed the future cash flows of the CGUs while
taking into account the current economic environment. Management considered the fact that the
Group’s cash flows have been strong in the past few years and also profitability of most of the
CGUs was on an improving track in 2023.

The goodwill test results are evaluated by comparing the recoverable amount (E) with the

**Ratio** **Estimate**

E < T Impairment

E 0-20% - T Slightly above

E 20-50% - T Clearly above

E 50%- - T Substantially above

As a result of the impairment tests performed, no impairment loss has been recognised in 2023
or in 2022. In the 2023 testing the recoverable amount exceeded the balance sheet value in
Industry clearly and in other CGUs substantially. In the 2022 testing the recoverable amount
exceeded the balance sheet value in Germany, Denmark and Industry clearly and in other CGUs
substantially. Management has assessed that in Germany (CGU 6) a reasonably possible
change in key assumptions might lead into impairment. Management has prepared sensitivity
analysis for that CGU:

**Accounting principles**

Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration
transferred over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the net identifiable assets of the
acquiree and the fair value of the non-controlling interest in the acquiree on the date of
acquisition. The net identifiable assets include the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed as
well as the contingent liabilities. The consideration transferred is measured at fair value.

Impairment testing
Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstances indicate a potential impairment. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill
is allocated to cash-generating units. Goodwill is measured at the original acquisition cost less
impairment. Impairment is expensed immediately in the income statement and is not
subsequently reversed. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount
of goodwill relating to the entity disposed of.

Goodwill is tested for any impairment annually in accordance with the accounting policy. The
recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value-in-use
calculations. The cash flows in the value-in-use calculations are based on the management's
best estimate of market development for the subsequent years. The discount rate may be
increased with a branch specific risk factor.

The recoverable amounts have been assessed in relation to different time periods and the
sensitivity has been analysed for the changes of the discount rate, profitability and the terminal
growth rate.


Revenue in the forecast period (scenario 1) 2.8% average growth

(CAGR) -10.8% p.p.

**Accounting principles**
An intangible asset is initially recognised in the balance sheet at acquisition cost when the
acquisition cost can be reliably determined and the economic benefits are expected to flow
from the asset to the Group. Intangible assets with a known or estimated limited useful life are
expensed in the income statement on a straight-line basis over their useful life.

Other intangible assets acquired in connection with business acquisitions are recognised
separately from goodwill if they meet the definition of an intangible asset: they are separable
or are based on contractual or other legal rights. Intangible assets recognised in connection
with business acquisitions include e.g. the value of customer agreements and associated
customer relationships, prohibition of competition agreements, the value of acquired
technology and industry related process competences. The value of customer agreements
and their associated customer relationships and industry related process competence is
determined using the cash flows estimated according to the durability and duration of the
assumed customer relations.


**Impairment of tangible and intangible assets**
At each closing date, the Group evaluates whether there is an indication that an asset may be
impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of said asset is estimated. In
addition, the recoverable amount is assessed annually for each of the following assets
regardless of whether there is any indication of impairment: goodwill, intangible assets with
an indefinite useful life and intangible assets not yet available for use. The need for impairment
is assessed at the level of cash-generating units.

The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and
the value in use. The value in use is determined based on the discounted future net cash flows
estimated to be recoverable from the assets in question or cash-generating units. The discount
rate used is a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money
and the risks specific to the asset. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of
the asset is higher than its recoverable amount. The impairment loss is recognised
immediately in the income statement and is initially allocated to the goodwill allocated to the
cash-generating unit and thereafter to other assets pro rata on the basis of their carrying
amounts. An impairment loss is reversed when the circumstances change and the amount
recoverable from the asset has changed since the date when the impairment loss was
recorded. However, impairment losses are not reversed beyond the carrying amount of the
asset that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior
years. Impairment losses on goodwill are never reversed.

###### 5.1 Capital management

The objective of capital management in Caverion Group is to maintain an optimal capital
structure, maximise the return on the respective capital employed and to minimise the cost of
capital within the limits and principles stated in the Treasury Policy. The capital structure is
modified primarily by directing investments and working capital employed.

In March, Caverion repaid the remaining part of the EUR 75 million senior unsecured bond
issued in 2019 according to its terms and conditions which totalled EUR 3.5 million following
the tender offer in February 2022. Also, Caverion announced on 14 April 2023 that it will
exercise its right to redeem its EUR 35 million hybrid bond, an instrument subordinated to the
company’s other debt obligations and treated as equity in the IFRS financial statements. The
hybrid bond was redeemed in full on 15 May 2023 in accordance with its terms and conditions.

Caverion has on 31 October 2023 become an additional borrower in Senior Facilities
Agreement executed between Crayfish Bidco Oy and a group of banks. The new facility
consists of term loan facility of EUR 410 million, revolving credit facility of EUR 75 million and
committed guarantee facility of EUR 65 million. The term loan facility has a termination date
in three years following the acquisition closing date on 31 October 2023, whereas revolving
credit facility and guarantee facility have termination dates in two years and nine months
following the acquisitions closing date. The new facilities secure Caverion’s long term
financing needs, seasonal working capital financing as well as certain bank guarantee facilities
crucial to the project business. The term loan facility has been allocated partly to purchase
Caverion shares and partly to repay the existing debt outstanding on 31 October 2023.

In the end of December Caverion prepaid its EUR 50 million term loan and cancelled the
unutilized EUR 100 million revolving credit facility with initial termination date on 15 January
2025. Caverion has refinanced the loan with a EUR 50 million withdrawal from the new term
loan facility.

The change of control event on 31 October 2023 also triggered an option for the holders
of EUR 75 million senior unsecured bond due 25 February 2027 to request a repurchase. The
noteholders submitted valid repurchase instructions for EUR 72.1 million in principal amount
of the notes, which Caverion repurchased on 29 January 2024. Similarly, the refinancing
happened with a withdrawal from the long term loan facility.

Caverion's business model is asset light and typically requires little investments.
Caverion’s targeted operational capex level (excluding acquisitions and capitalised lease
contracts) should not exceed 1 percent of revenue. Growth will be supported by bolt-on
acquisitions in selected growth areas and complementary capabilities. Caverion aims at 100
per cent cash conversion (operating cash flow before financial and tax items/EBITDA) in order
to ensure a healthy cash flow.

Caverion’s management evaluates and continuously monitors the amount of funding
required in the Group’s business activities to ensure it has adequate liquid funds to finance its
operations, repay its loans at maturity and pay annual dividends. The funding requirements


timely cash planning. Caverion’s Group Treasury is responsible for maintaining sufficient
funding, availability of different funding sources and a controlled maturity profile for the
external loans. Caverion targets a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of less than 2.5 times.

Cash management and funding is centralised in Group Treasury. With a centralised cash
management, the use of liquid funds can be optimised between different units of the Group.

###### Hybrid capital

On 15 May 2020 Caverion issued a EUR 35 million hybrid bond, an instrument subordinated
to the company's other debt obligations and treated as equity in the IFRS financial statements.
The hybrid bond does not confer to its holders the rights of a shareholder and does not dilute
the holdings of the current shareholders. The coupon of the hybrid bond was 6.75 percent per
annum until 15 May 2023. Caverion announced on 14 April 2023 that it will exercise its right
to redeem its EUR 35 million hybrid bond. The hybrid bond was redeemed in full on 15 May
2023 in accordance with its terms and conditions.

###### Unrestricted equity reserve

Caverion announced in a stock exchange release on 7 February 2018 the establishment of a
new share-based incentive plan directed at the key employees of the Group (“Matching Share
Plan 2018-2022”). In connection with the technical execution of the plan a total of 3,800,000
new shares were subscribed for in Caverion Corporation’s share issue directed to the
company itself without payment, and were entered into the Trade Register on 19 February
2018. The total capital raised amounted to EUR 6.67 million and was recorded in entirety into
the unrestricted equity reserve.

Caverion executed a directed share issue of new shares in June 2018 in order to maintain
a strong balance sheet and to retain strategic flexibility after the payment of the German antitrust fine. On 15 June 2018, the Company announced that it had directed a share issue of
9,524,000 new shares in the Company to institutional investors, corresponding to
approximately 7.36 percent of all the shares and votes in the Company immediately prior to
the share issue raising gross proceeds of EUR 60.0 million. The subscription price was
recorded in its entirety into the unrestricted equity reserve of the company.

###### Dividends

The Annual General Meeting held on 27 March 2023 decided that a dividend of EUR 0.20 per
share will be paid for the year 2022.

The Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting to be held on 12 June
2024 that no dividend will be paid for the year 2023.

The total number of Caverion Corporation's shares was 138,920,092 (138,920,092) and the
share capital amounted to EUR 1.0 (1.0) million on December 31, 2023.

All the issued and subscribed shares have been fully paid to the company. Shares do not
have a nominal value.

###### Treasury shares

Caverion held 1,873,825 (2,447,447) treasury shares on December 31, 2023. The
consideration paid for the treasury shares amounted to EUR 2.0 million on December 31, 2023

own shares as treasury shares and has the right to return them to the market in the future.

###### Translation differences

Translation differences include the exchange rate differences recognised in Group
consolidation. In addition, the portion of the gains and losses of effective hedges on the net
investment in foreign subsidiaries, which are hedged with currency forwards, is recognised in
equity. There were no hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation in 2023 or 2022.

###### Fair value reserve

Fair value reserve includes movements in the fair value of the investments that are not held
for trading, and the derivative instruments used for cash flow hedging.

###### 5.4 Financial assets and liabilities by category

IFRS 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary
measurement categories for financial assets: amortised cost, fair value through other


comprehensive income (FVTOCI) and fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL). The standard
has been applied as of 1 January 2018.

The carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities except for non-current loans
approximate their fair value. The fair value of non-current loans amounted to EUR 141.4
(140.1) million at the end of 2023. The fair values of non-current loans are based on discounted
cash flows and are categorised within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Discount rate is
defined to be the rate that the Group was to pay for an equivalent external loan at year end. It
consists of a risk-free market rate and a company and maturity related risk premium.

**Investments consist of as follows:**
**2023** **2022**

Quoted shares (level 1 in fair value hierarchy) 0.5 0.4

Unquoted shares (level 3 in fair value hierarchy) 0.7 0.7

**Total** **1.1** **1.1**

The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market
prices at the balance sheet date. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily
and regularly available from an exchange and those prices represent actual and regularly
occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis. The quoted market price used for
financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price. These instruments are included in
Level 1. Instruments included in Level 1 comprise primarily funds and OMXH equity
investments. Investments categorised in Level 3 are non-listed equity instruments and they
are measured at acquisition cost less any impairment or prices obtained from a broker as their
fair value cannot be measured reliably.

**Accounting principles**

**Financial assets**
**Classification and measurement**
Financial assets are classified at initial recognition into the following categories according to
IFRS 9: at fair value through profit or loss, at fair value through other comprehensive income
and at amortised cost. The classification depends on the objective of the business model and
the characteristics of contractual cash flows of the item.

**Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss**
Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss are financial assets or derivatives that do
not meet the criteria for hedge accounting. A financial asset is classified in this category if
acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. Derivatives and other financial
assets at fair value through profit and loss are initially measured at fair value and transaction
costs are expensed in the income statement. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are
measured at fair value. Realised and unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in fair
value are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they arise. Assets in this
l ifi d (R i bl ) if d b l d f 12


months and as current assets (Trade and other receivables) if expected to be settled within
12 months.

**Amortised cost**
The Group’s non-derivative financial assets and cash and cash equivalents are classified to
amortised cost category. This category comprises loans receivables, trade receivables, cash
and cash equivalents and other receivables. These are included in current assets, except for
maturities greater than 12 months after the reporting period, which are classified as noncurrent. These assets are initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs are expensed
in the income statement. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are carried at amortised cost
using the effective interest rate method less any impairment. Due to the nature of short-term
receivables and other receivables, their book value is expected to equal to the fair value.

Cash and cash equivalents include cash at hand, bank deposits withdrawable on demand
and liquid short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less.

**Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income**
Equity investments in non-listed investments that are not held for trading, are classified as
equity instruments designated at fair value through other comprehensive income.

These assets are initially recognised at fair value, plus any transaction costs. Subsequent
to initial recognition, they are carried at fair value. Changes in the fair value are recognised in
other comprehensive income and are presented in the fair value reserves under shareholders'
equity, net of tax. When investments are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value
adjustments recognised in equity are never recycled to income statement.

These assets are non-current financial assets when the Group intends not to dispose them
within the next 12 months.

**Recognition and derecognition**
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade-date which is the
date on which Caverion Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets are
derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investment have expired or have
been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risk and rewards of ownership.

Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the financial assets at fair value
through profit or loss category are presented in the income statement within finance income
and expenses in the period in which they arise. Interest income from items at amortised cost
are presented in the income statement within finance income in the period in which they arise.
Dividend income from financial assets is recognised in the income statement as part of
financial income when the Group’s right to receive payments is established.


-----

**Offsetting financial instruments**
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet
when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an
intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

**Impairment of financial assets**
**Assets carried at amortised costs**
Caverion Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective
evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired as a result of one or
more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (“a loss event”). That loss
event must impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial
assets that can be reliably estimated.

Objective evidence that financial assets are impaired includes: default or delinquency in
interest or principal payments, significant financial difficulty, restructuring of an amount due to
the Group, indications that a debtor will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation,
observable data indicating that there is measurable decrease in expected cash flows, such as
changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults.

For loans and receivables, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between
the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted
at the asset’s original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced and
the amount of the loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement within other
operating expenses. Caverion Group considers evidence of impairment at both an individual
asset and a collective level. All individually significant assets are individually assessed for
impairment. Collective assessment is carried out by grouping together assets with similar risk
characteristics.

Risks related to trade and other operative receivables are described in note 3.2.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease
can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the
previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through the income statement.

**Financial liabilities**
Borrowings are recorded on the settlement date and initially at fair value, net of transaction
costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost and any difference
between the proceeds and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over
the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Other borrowing costs are
expensed in the period during which they are incurred. Fees paid on the establishment of loan
facilities are recognised as expenses over the period of the facility to which it relates.
Borrowings are derecognised when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or
expire.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within 12 months or less.
If not they are presented as non current


###### 5.5 Financial risk management

Caverion Group is exposed in its business operations to liquidity risk, credit risk, foreign
exchange risk and interest rate risk. The objective of Caverion’s financial risk management is
to minimise the uncertainty which the changes in financial markets cause to its financial
performance.

At the end of December 2023, despite the slight signs of easing, the core inflation is still
high with uncertainty around its future direction. With limited central bank guidance, the
amount and size of the next interest movements are hard to predict. Continuing high volatility
on foreign exchange rates is also expected. Caverion monitors the risks closely and, at the
moment, does not see any need for changes in the risk management principles. The risks
related to the availability of financing, the availability of guarantee facilities as well as foreign
exchange and interest rate related risks are in control. Caverion monitors the risks closely
and at the moment does not see any need for changes in the risk management principles. The
risks related to the availability of financing, the availability of guarantee facilities as well as
foreign exchange and interest rate related risks are in control.

Risk management is carried out by Caverion Group Treasury in co-operation with divisions
under policies approved by the Board of Directors. Financing activities are carried out by
finance personnel and management in the divisions and subsidiaries. Responsibilities in
between the Group Treasury and divisions are defined in the Group’s Treasury Policy.
Divisions are responsible for providing the Group Treasury timely and accurate information on
their financial position, cash flows and foreign exchange position in order to ensure the
Group’s efficient cash and liquidity management, funding and risk management. In addition,
the Group’s Treasury Policy defines main principles and methods for financial risk
management, cash management and specific financing-related areas e.g. commercial
guarantees, relationships with financiers and customer financing.

###### Interest rate risk

Caverion has interest-bearing receivables in its cash and cash equivalents but otherwise its
revenues and cash flows from operating activities are mostly independent of changes in
market interest rates.

Caverion’s exposure to cash flow interest rate risk arises mainly from current and noncurrent loans. Borrowing issued at floating interest rates expose Caverion to cash flow interest
rate risk. To manage the interest rate risk, the Board of Directors of Caverion Group has
defined an average interest rate fixing term target for the Group’s net debt (excluding cash).
At the reporting date the average interest rate fixing term of net debt (excluding cash) was
14.0 (28.1) months. At the end of December 2023 Caverion has not used interest rate
derivatives to hedge interest rate risk.


-----

**Result before taxes**

**2023             2022**


The weighted average effective interest rate of the whole loan portfolio excluding IFRS 16
effects was 7.4% (3.0%) at the end of December 2023. Fixed-rate loans accounted for
approximately 57 (59) percent of the Group’s borrowings.

In addition to the targeted average interest rate fixing term of net debt, Caverion Group’s
management monitors regularly the effect of the possible change in interest rate level on the
Group’s financial result. The monitored number is the effect of one percentage point rise in
interest rate level on yearly net interest expenses.


###### Interest rate risk sensitivity

**EUR million**


Interest rate of net debt 1 percentage point higher 0.2 0.2

Net debt includes interest-bearing liabilities and cash and cash equivalents. Sensitivities are
calculated based on the situation at the balance sheet date.

###### Financial counterparty risk

The financial instruments the Group has agreed with its banks and financial institutions contain
a risk of the counterparty being unable to meet its obligations. The Group Treasury is
responsible for the counterparty risk of derivative instruments and financial investment
products.

Counterparties to the financial instruments are chosen based on Caverion Group
management’s estimate on their reliability. The Board of Directors of Caverion Group accepts
the main banks used by the Group and counterparties to derivative instruments. CFO accepts
conterparties to short-term investments. Short-term investments related to liquidity
management are made according to Caverion’s Treasury Policy. No impairment has been
recognised on derivative instruments or investment products in the reporting period. Caverion
Group’s management does not expect any credit losses from non-performance by
counterparties to investment products or derivative instruments.

As a result of the partial demerger of YIT Corporation registered on 30 June 2013, a
secondary liability has been generated to Caverion Corporation, a new company established
in the partial demerger, for those liabilities that have been generated before the registration of
the demerger and remain with YIT Corporation after the demerger. Caverion Corporation has
a secondary liability relating to the Group guarantees that remain with YIT Corporation after
the demerger, if YIT Corporation falls into default. These Group guarantees amounted to EUR
21.5 (20.4) million at the end of December 2023.

###### Refinancing and liquidity risk

Refinancing risk is defined as a risk that funds are not available or the costs of refinancing
maturing debt is high at the time a debt needs to be refinanced. The objective of liquidity risk
management is to maintain a sufficient liquidity reserve in all situations. Liquidity and
refinancing risk is managed by diversifying the maturities of external loans and monitoring the
proportion of short-term debt (maturing in less than one year’s time) and the long-term liquidity
forecast for the Group. The Group shall always have liquidity reserve available to meet the
need for debt repayments falling due during the calendar year and to cover the potential
funding need over the planning period of business operations including planned capital
expenditure. Adequate liquidity is maintained by keeping sufficient amount of unused
committed credit facilities as a reserve.


-----

Caverion has on 31 October 2023 become an additional borrower in Senior Facilities
Agreement executed between Crayfish Bidco Oy and a group of banks. The new facility
consists of term loan facility of EUR 410 million, revolving credit facility of EUR 75 million and
committed guarantee facility of EUR 65 million. The term loan facility has a termination date
in three years following the acquisition closing date on 31 October 2023, whereas revolving
credit facility and guarantee facility have termination dates in two years and nine months
following the acquisitions closing date. The new facilities secure Caverion’s long term
financing needs, seasonal working capital financing as well as certain bank guarantee facilities
crucial to the project business. The term loan facility has been allocated partly to purchase
Caverion shares and partly to repay the existing debt outstanding on 31 October 2023.

During the year 2023, Caverion has repaid the EUR 75 million senior unsecured bond
issued in 2019 according to its terms and conditions which totalled EUR 3.5 million following
the tender offer in February 2022. Also, Caverion redeemed its EUR 35 million hybrid bond in
full on May 15 2023 in accordance with its terms and conditions. In December Caverion
refinanced its EUR 50 million term loan from the new long term loan facility and cancelled the
unutilized EUR 100 million revolving credit facility with initial termination date on 15 January
2025 in the end of December. The change of control event on 31 October 2023 also triggered
an option for the holders of EUR 75 million senior unsecured bond due 25 February 2027 to
request a repurchase. The noteholders submitted valid repurchase instructions for EUR 72.1
million in principal amount of the notes, which Caverion repurchased on 29 January 2024.
Similarly, the refinancing happened with a withdrawal from the long term loan facility.

Caverion Group’s interest-bearing loans and borrowings amounted to 132.0 (144.6) million
at the end of December. Approximately 39 percent of the loans have been raised from financial
institutions and 61 percent from investors. The Group’s net debt amounted to EUR 90.4 (63.4)
million at the end of December excluding IFRS 16 effects and EUR 236.8 (200.9) including
IFRS 16 effects. At the end of December, the Group’s gearing was 134.8 (89.1) percent and
its equity ratio 15.6 (19.8) percent including IFRS 16 effects.

Caverion’s external loans are subject to a financial covenant based on the ratio of the
Group’s net debt to EBITDA on Crayfish BidCo Oy level according to the calculation principles
confirmed with the lending parties. The Group is in compliance with the financial covenant. To
manage liquidity risk, Caverion uses cash and cash equivalents, Group accounts with
overdraft facilities, credit facilities and commercial papers. Caverion’s cash and cash
equivalents amounted to EUR 41.5 (81.2) million at the end of December 2023. In addition,
Caverion has undrawn overdraft facilities amounting to EUR 41.2 (19.7) million and undrawn
committed revolving credit facilities amounting to EUR 48.7 (100) million. EUR 26.2 million of
the overdraft facilities are carved out of the EUR 75 million committed revolving credit facilities.
The committed revolving credit facilities are valid until July 2026.

The following table describes the contractual maturities of financial liabilities. The amounts
are undiscounted. Interest cash flows of floating rate loans and derivative instruments are
based on the interest rates prevailing on December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022). Cash


flows of foreign currency denominated loans are translated into euro at the reporting date.
Cash flows of foreign currency forward contracts are translated into euro at forward rates.

Here net investment comprises equity invested in foreign subsidiaries and internal loans that
qualify for net investment classification deducted by possible goodwill in the subsidiaries
balance sheet.

According to Caverion Group’s Treasury policy, all Group companies are responsible for
identifying and hedging the foreign exchange risk related to the foreign currency denominated
cash flows. All firm commitments of over EUR 0.2 million must be hedged by intra-group
transactions with Group Treasury. Group Treasury hedges the net position with external
counterparties but does not apply hedge accounting to derivatives hedging foreign exchange
risk. Accordingly, the fair value changes of derivative instruments are recognised in the
consolidated income statement. There were no foreign exchange hedges, which relate to
commercial contracts on the reporting date.

Excluding the foreign exchange differences due to translation risk related to the
investments in foreign operations, the strengthening or weakening of the Euro does not have
a significant impact on the Group’s result. The foreign exchange derivate contracts made for
hedging internal and external loans and receivables offset the effect of changes in foreign
exchange rates.

###### 5.6 Derivative instruments

All derivatives are hedges according to Caverion Group’s Treasury Policy, but hedge
accounting as defined in IFRS 9 is not applied for valid derivative contracts. Foreign exchange
forward contracts are mainly designated as hedges of financial items and have been charged
to P/L in finance income/expenses. Foreign exchange forward contracts mature in 2023. There
were no outstanding interest rate swaps in December 2022.

The Group’s derivative instruments are subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting
arrangements or similar agreements. In certain circumstances – e.g. when a credit event such
as a default occurs, all outstanding transactions under the agreement are terminated, the
termination value is assessed and only a single net amount is payable in settlement of all
transactions. Master netting agreements do not meet the criteria for offsetting in the statement
of financial position and amounts are presented on a gross basis. Other financial assets or

###### Foreign exchange risk

Caverion Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risks arising from
the currencies of the countries in which it operates. Risk arises mainly from the recognised
assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations. In addition, commercial
contracts in the subsidiaries cause foreign exchange risk, but the contracts are mainly
denominated in the entity’s own functional currencies.

The objective of foreign exchange risk management is to reduce uncertainty caused by
foreign exchange rate movements on income statement through measurement of cash flows
and commercial receivables and payables. By the decision of the Board of Directors of
Caverion Group, the investments in foreign operations are not hedged for foreign exchange
translation risk.

liabilities, for example trade receivables or trade payables, do not include any amounts subject
to netting agreements.

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example,
over-the-counter derivatives) is determined by using valuation techniques. These valuation
techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little
as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an
instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. The fair values for the
derivative instruments categorised in Level 2 have been defined as follows: the fair values of
foreign exchange forward and forward rate agreements have been defined by using the market
prices at the closing day. The fair values of interest rate swaps are based on discounted cash
flows.

**Accounting principles**
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date Caverion Group becomes party to
an agreement and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value. Directly attributable
transaction costs are recognised in the income statement. The method of recognising the
resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging
instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. Currency forward contracts are
used for hedging against the currency exposure of exchange rates and resulting changes in


fair value are included in operating profit or financial income and expenses based on their
nature in the financial period in which they were incurred. Interest rate swaps are used to
hedge against changes in market interest rates. Changes in the fair value of interest rate
swaps that do not meet the hedge accounting criteria under IFRS 9, are entered in financing
income or expenses in the financial period in which they were incurred. Derivatives are
classified as non-current liabilities when their contractual maturity is more than 12 months
(Other liabilities) and current liabilities when maturity is less than 12 months (Trade and other
payables).

Derivative instruments used in hedge accounting which meet the hedge accounting criteria
under IFRS 9 are entered in the balance sheet at fair value on the day that Caverion Group
becomes counterpart to the agreement. The Group has applied hedge accounting to hedge
the benchmark rate of floating rate loans (cash flow hedging). The Group documents at
inception of the transaction the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging
instruments and assesses both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the
derivatives are effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items. The effectiveness
is assessed at each balance sheet date at minimum. The effective portion of changes in the
fair value of derivative instruments that qualify for cash flow hedges is recognised in other
comprehensive income and accumulate in the fair value reserve. The gain or loss relating to
the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement within financial
income and expenses. Gains and losses accumulated in shareholders' equity are reclassified
to income statement within financial income or expenses in the periods when the hedged item
affects profit or loss. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer
meets the criteria of hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that
time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction occurs. Nevertheless,
if the hedged forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss
that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement within financial
income or expense.

**Accounting principles**
The consolidated financial statements include associated companies in which the Group either
holds 20%-50% of the voting rights or in which the Group otherwise has significant influence
but not control. Companies where the Group has joint control with another entity are
considered as joint ventures. Investments in associated companies and joint ventures are
accounted for using the equity method: they are initially recorded at cost and the carrying
amount is increased or decreased by Caverion’s share of the profit or loss. The Group
determines at each reporting date whether there is any indication of impairment.

The Group’s share of post-acquisition profit or loss is recognised in the income statement
and its share of post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive income with a
corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment. Dividends received from
an associated company or joint venture reduce the carrying amount of the investment. When
the Group’s share of losses in an associate exceeds its interest in the associate, including any
other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has
incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the
extent of the Group’s interest in each associate.

**Multi-employer plan in Sweden**
In Sweden, Caverion participates in a multi-employer defined benefit plan in Alecta insurance
company. 932 employees of Caverion Sverige AB are insured through this pension plan in
2023. This multi-employer plan has not been able to deliver sufficient information for defined
benefit accounting purposes, thus Caverion has accounted for this pension plan as a
contribution plan.

Alecta's possible surplus may be credited to the employer company or to employee. The
expected contributions to the plan for the next annual reporting period are EUR 6.4 million.

Through its defined benefit pension plans the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the
most significant of which are detailed below:

_Changes in bond yields - A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities._
_Inflation risk - some of the Group pension obligations are linked to inflation and higher_
inflation will lead to higher liabilities.

_Life expectancy - The majority of the plans’ obligations are to provide benefits for the life_
of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans’ liabilities.

**Accounting principles**
Caverion Group has several different pension schemes, both defined benefit and defined
contribution pension plans, in accordance with local regulations and practices in countries
where it operates.

Contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised in the income
statement in the financial period during which the charge is due. Caverion Group has no legal
or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient
assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current or prior
periods.

The Group has defined benefit pension plans in Norway, Austria, Germany and Finland.
Obligations connected with the Group's defined benefit plans are calculated annually by
independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The discount rate used in
calculating the present value of the pension obligation is the market rate of high-quality
corporate bonds. The maturity of the bonds used to determine the reference rate substantially
corresponds to the maturity of the related pension obligation. In defined benefit plans, the
pension liability recognised on the balance sheet is the present value of the defined benefit
obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of the plan assets. Pension
expenditure is expensed in the income statement, allocating the costs over the employment
term of the employees. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and
changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive
income in the period in which they arise. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the
income statement.

Occupational pensions in Sweden have been insured under a pension scheme shared
with numerous employers It has not been possible to acquire sufficient information on these

**_1)_** _Based on the sensitivity analyses of the Group's most significant pension arrangements. The impacts of the other pension_
_arrangements are similar._

The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other
assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the
assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit
obligations to significant actuarial assumptions the same method has been applied as when
calculating the pension liability recognised within the statement of financial position.

pension obligation for allocating the liabilities and assets by employers. Occupational pensions
in Sweden have been treated on a defined contribution basis.

The present value of pension obligations depends on various factors that are determined
on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions, including the discount rate. Changes in
the assumptions rate have an effect on the carrying amount of pension obligation. The
discount rate used is the market rate of high-quality corporate bonds or the interest rate of
treasury notes for the currency in which the benefits will be realised. The maturity of the
instruments used to determine the reference rate used corresponds substantially to the
maturity of the related pension obligation. Other assumptions are based on actuarial statistics
and prevailing market conditions.

million (EUR 3.4 million) in 2023. The nominal amount of leasing commitments of low-value
and short-term leases amounted to EUR 9.9 million at the end of 2023 (EUR 5.4 million). The
present value of lease liability of leases not yet commenced to which Caverion is committed
amounted to EUR 2.2 million at the end of 2023 (EUR 1.1 million).

The Group has subleased some of its leased premises. The income recognised by the
Group for these premises during the year 2023 was EUR 0.7 million (EUR 0.8 million).

###### Group as lessor

As a lessor, the Group has finance lease contracts for which the net investment in the balance
sheet amounted to EUR 0.2 million at the end of the year 2023 (EUR 0.3 million). The income
statement effect of these finance lease contracts amounted to EUR 0.0 million in 2023 (EUR
0.1 million) comprising the selling profit of the contract and interest income.

**Accounting principles**
**Group as lessee**
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments,
discounted by using an estimate of the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial
application. Since the interest implicit in the lease contracts is not available, a management
estimate is used to determine the incremental borrowing rate. The components of the rate are
the following: the currency-specific reference rate and the interest margin that is derived from
each individual company’s risk assessment, adjusted to reflect the maturity of the lease
contract.

At the inception of the lease, Caverion measures the right-of-use asset at an amount equal
to the lease liability. After the initial measurement, the right-of-use asset is measured at cost
less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment.

Caverion does not recognise an IFRS 16 lease liability for leases for which the underlying
asset is not material The assessment of whether the underlying asset is material and is within


the scope or excluded from the recognition requirements of IFRS 16 is based on the concept
of materiality in the Conceptual Framework and IAS 1. Caverion recognises lease payments
associated with such leases as an expense on a straight-line basis.

Caverion does not recognise short-term leases on the balance sheet. Short-term leases
are lease contracts that have a lease term of 12 months or less, and which do not include an
option to purchase the underlying asset. Caverion has analysed lease contracts where the
lease term is not fixed but both the lessor and lessee have an option to terminate the lease
within 1-12 months’ notice. Management judgement based on realistic estimates is used when
determining the lease term for short-term leases and leasing agreements with non-fixed terms.
If the termination of the short-term contract is practically realistic within the time of the notice
period (1-12 months), those contracts have been excluded from the lease liability.

As a practical expedient, IFRS 16 permits a lessee not to separate non-lease components
and instead account for a lease and its associated non-lease components as a single
arrangement. Caverion has used the practical expedient for car leases that include service
components. On the other hand, the non-lease component from real estate lease contracts
has been separated and the non-lease components have been booked as expenses.

**Group as lessor**
Under IFRS 16, a lessor classifies arrangements which convey a right to use a specific asset
as either finance leases or operating leases and accounts for these two types of leases
differently. Caverion's lease contracts relate to different types of machinery and equipment
which are installed to operate within the customer's buildings and structures. These lease
contracts vary in terms of conditions.

In finance leases, the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased asset have
substantially transferred from Caverion to the lessee. Sales derived from finance leases are
recognised at the beginning of the lease period in accordance with the same principles as in
the outright sale of similar assets. The net investment in finance leases is recognised as a part
of non-current and current receivables and lease payments are disclosed as repayments of
the finance lease receivable and interest income. The interest income is recognised on the
income statement over the lease term so as to achieve a constant interest rate on the
outstanding balance.

In operating leases, the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased asset
remain with the lessor. The leased assets are recognised on the balance sheet as a part of
tangible assets and depreciated in accordance with the policy applied to similar assets in own
use as well as considering the planned use after the lease period. The lease income from
operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term on the income
statement.

Under IFRS 16, an intermediate lessor is additionally required to classify its subleases as
finance or operating leases by reference to the right-of-use assets arising from the head lease.
Caverion has not reclassified any of its sublease agreements as finance leases.

###### 5.10 Commitments and contingent liabilities

**EUR million** **2023** **2022**

Other commitments

Other contingent liabilities

Accrued unrecognised interest on hybrid bond 1.5

The Group’s parent company has guaranteed obligations of its subsidiaries. On December
31, 2023 the total amount of these guarantees was EUR 500.3 (493.1) million. These consist
of counter guarantees for external guarantees and parent company guarantees given
according to general contracting practices.

Parent company Caverion Oyj has on 31 October 2023 become an additional borrower
and additional guarantor in Senior Facilities Agreement (SFA) executed between Crayfish
Bidco Oy and a group of banks. According to terms and conditions of the SFA, the members
of Caverion Group i.e. the parent company Caverion Oyj and its subsidiaries are required to
provide guarantees and securities to the lenders. Those guarantees and securities may be
limited in scope and substance. Guarantees and securities from subsidiaries will be delivered
within 120 days of the first utilisation of any loan facility. The first utilisation date was 29
December 2023. The agreed security principles contain two tests that need to be fulfilled.
Firstly, there is material company requirement, which includes subsidiaries contributing 5% or
more of the consolidated EBITDA of the Group. Secondly, guarantor entities must together
equate to over 80% of the Group EBITDA. The above requirements only apply to entities
incorporated in Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark. Agreed security principles require a
security over the shares in a material company and over material intercompany loans with a
certain threshold. The total book value of such shares to be included under the securities was
EUR 221,3 million on 31 December 2023. There were no material intercompany loans that
meet the agreed security principles. Until Crayfish BidCo Oy owns 100% of Caverion Group,
guarantee granted by the Caverion Group shall be limited to the amount of the facilities
actually borrowed by members of Caverion Group only, excluding the obligations of Crayfish
BidCo Oy. This concerns the obligations under the EUR 410 million term loan facility, EUR 75
million revolving credit facility and EUR 65 million committed guarantee facility. After 100%
ownership is reached, the guarantees and securities of Caverion Group will cover also
Crayfish BidCo Oy obligations, but may be limited if required to comply with relevant local
regulations regarding financial assistance constraints.

Given the nature of Caverion’s Projects business, Group companies are involved in
disputes and legal proceedings in several projects. These disputes and legal proceedings
typically concern claims made against Caverion for allegedly defective or delayed delivery. In
some cases, the collection of receivables by Caverion may result in disputes and legal
proceedings. There is a risk that the client presents counter claims in these proceedings. The


outcome of claims, disputes and legal proceedings is difficult to predict. Write-downs and
provisions are booked following the applicable accounting rules.

In June 2018, Caverion reached a settlement for its part with the German Federal Office
(FCO) in a cartel case that had been investigated by the authority since 2014. The
investigation concerned several companies providing technical building services in Germany.
Caverion Deutschland GmbH (and its predecessors) was found to have participated in anticompetitive practices between 2005 and 2013. According to the FCO’s final decision issued
on 3 July 2018, Caverion Deutschland GmbH was imposed a fine of EUR 40.8 million. In the
end of March 2020, the FCO issued its final decision on the cartel case against the other
building technology companies involved in the matter. There is a risk that civil claims may be
presented against the involved companies, including Caverion Deutschland GmbH. It is not
possible to evaluate the magnitude of the risk for Caverion at this time. Some civil claims
presented against Caverion Deutschland GmbH have been settled in recent years.

As part of Caverion’s co-operation with the authorities in the cartel matter, the company
identified activities between 2009 and 2011 that were likely to fulfil the criteria of corruption or
other criminal commitment in one of its client projects executed in that time. Caverion has
brought its findings to the attention of the authorities and supported them in further
investigating the case. In the end of June 2020, the public prosecutor's office in Munich
informed Caverion that no further investigative measures are intended and that no formal fine
proceedings against Caverion will be initiated related to those cases. There is a risk that civil
claims may be presented against Caverion Deutschland GmbH. It is not possible to evaluate
the magnitude of the risk for Caverion at this time. Caverion will disclose any relevant
information on the potential civil law claims as required under the applicable regulations.

Entities participating in the demerger are jointly and severally responsible for the liabilities
of the demerging entity which have been generated before the registration of the demerger.
As a consequence, a secondary liability up to the allocated net asset value was generated to
Caverion Corporation, incorporated due to the partial demerger of YIT Corporation, for those
liabilities that were generated before the registration of the demerger and remain with YIT
Corporation after the demerger. Creditors of YIT Corporation’s major financial liabilities have
waived their right to claim for settlement from Caverion Corporation on the basis of the
secondary liability. Caverion Corporation has a secondary liability relating to the Group
guarantees which remain with YIT Corporation after the demerger. These Group guarantees
amounted to EUR 21.5 (20.4) million at the end of December 2023.

###### 6.2 Share-based payments

Caverion has long-term share-based incentive schemes which are a part of the remuneration
and commitment programme for the management and key personnel of Caverion Group. The
key aim is to align the interests of the shareholders and the executives in order to promote
shareholder value creation and to commit the key executives to the company and its strategic
targets and to offer them a competitive reward plan based on the ownership of the company’s
shares.

Caverion’s Board of Directors approved a rolling long-term share-based incentive plan for
the Group’s senior management and key employees in December 2015. The share-based
incentive plan consists of a Performance Share Plan (PSP) as the main structure,
complemented by a Restricted Share Plan (RSP) structure for specific situations. Both plans
consist of annually commencing individual plans, each lasting a three-year period. The
commencement of each new plan is subject to a separate decision of the Board. Of the plans
depicted below, the performance share plan commencing in 2018 was based on the rolling
incentive structure approved in December 2015. Also all restricted share plans commencing
during years 2018-2022 are based on the rolling structure originally approved in December
2015.

In December 2018, Caverion’s Board of Directors approved the establishment of a new
share-based long-term incentive plan which is based on a performance share plan (PSP)
structure. This new incentive structure consists of annually commencing individual
performance share plans, each with a three-year performance period, which is followed by the
payment of the potentially attained share reward. The performance share plans commencing
during years 2019-2022 are based on the rolling incentive structure approved in December
2018.

**Matching Share Plan 2018-2022**
In February 2018, Caverion announced the establishment of a share-based incentive plan


aim of the plan is to align the objectives of the shareholders and the key employees in order
to increase the value of the company in the long-term, to encourage the key employees to
personally invest in the company’s shares, to retain them at the company and to offer them a
competitive reward plan that is based on acquiring, receiving and holding the company’s
shares. The prerequisite for participating in MSP 2018-2022 is that a key employee acquires
company shares up to the number and in the manner determined by the Board of Directors.
The rewards from the plan will be paid in four instalments, one instalment each in 2019, 2020,
2021 and 2022. However, the reward payment will be deferred if the yield of the share has not
reached the pre-set minimum yield level by the end of the matching period in question. The
deferred reward will be paid as soon as practical after the pre-set minimum yield level has
been reached. If the pre-set minimum yield level has not been reached by the end of reward
instalment specific grace periods ending in 2021-2022, no reward from the matching period in
question will be paid. Furthermore, the receiving of the reward is tied to the continuance of the
participant’s employment or service upon reward payment.

The target group of MSP 2018-2022 consists of approximately 20 key executives, including
the members of the Group Management Board. The rewards to be paid on the basis of the
MSP correspond to the value of an approximate maximum total of 2,520,000 Caverion
Corporation shares (including also the portion to be paid in cash). In 2019, Caverion's Board
of Directors decided on share issues without consideration in which 391,469 shares were
conveyed to key employees participating in MSP 2018-2022 as a reward from the matching
period 1 March 2018 - 28 February 2019. A total of 4,431 shares from these issues were
returned to Caverion during 2020. In the spring 2021, 120,199 Caverion Corporation shares
were conveyed as a reward from the matching period 1 March 2018 - 29 February 2020 and,
for participants who joined the plan at a later stage, also as a reward from the matching period
1 March 2018 - 28 February 2019. Additionally, in the fall of 2021, 168,650 Caverion
Corporation shares were conveyed as a reward from the matching period 1 March 2018 - 28
February 2021. From the 2021 share issues, a total of 46,977 shares were returned to
Caverion.

No rewards were paid during 2022 under MSP 2018-2022. However, the Board of
Directors has in December 2022 decided to supplement the terms of the MSP.
Notwithstanding the grace period for the fourth instalment terminating on 31 December 2022,
the Board maintained full discretion to resolve on any partial or full pay-out under the fourth
instalment under certain conditions.

In the spring 2023, 164,658 Caverion Corporation shares were conveyed as a reward from
the matching period 1 March 2018 – 31 December 2022.

**Share-based long-term incentive plan 2019-2021**
In December 2018, Caverion’s Board of Director’s approved the commencement PSP 20192021 and RSP 2019-2021. PSP 2019-2021 could include a maximum of approximately 75 key
employees of Caverion Group. The performance target KPI’s were the relative total
shareholder return of the Company’s share and earnings per share. The targets for PSP 2019

-----

allocations were made for individually selected key employees in special situations. On 24
February 2022, 55,020 Caverion Corporation shares were conveyed in a share issue without
consideration to 22 key employees participating in RSP 2019-2021.

**Share-based long-term incentive plan 2020-2022**
In December 2019, Caverion’s Board of Director’s approved the commencement PSP 20202022 and RSP 2020-2022. However, on 30 April 2020, the Board decided, upon
management’s suggestion, to postpone the commencement of PSP 2020-2022 until the
beginning of the year 2021. The performance targets for the plan were the relative total
shareholder return of the Company’s share and earnings per share. The targets for PSP 20202022 were partially met and, in a directed share issue without consideration, 324,582 Caverion
Corporation shares were conveyed to 70 key employees during 2023. Within RSP 2020-2022,
share allocations were made for individually selected key employees in special situations. On
28 March 2023, 84,382 Caverion Corporation shares were conveyed in a directed share issue
without consideration to 29 key employees participating in RSP 2020-2022.

**Public tender offer and change in accounting treatment of outstanding share-based**
**incentive plans**
Following the completion of the public tender offer in late 2023, Caverion’s outstanding equitysettled share-based incentive plans (PSP 2021-2023, RSP 2021-2023, PSP 2022-2024 and
RSP 2022-2024) were agreed to be settled in cash in early 2024 based on the agreement
between Caverion and Crayfish BidCo Oy. As a result, the accounting treatment of Caverion’s
outstanding equity-settled share-based incentives was changed in the third quarter of 2023
and a modification from equity-settled to cash-settled classification in accounting under IFRS
2 Share-based Payment was made for all remaining share-based incentive plans.


**Share-based long-term incentive plan 2021-2023**
Caverion’s Board of Directors approved in December 2020 the commencement of PSP 20212023 and RSP 2021-2023. The performance targets for the plan were the relative total
shareholder return of the Company’s share and earnings per share. The targets for PSP 20212023 were partially met and reward will be paid in cash to key employees in early 2024.

Within RSP 2021-2023, share allocations are made for individually selected key
employees in special situations. The reward will be paid in cash to key employees in early
2024.

**Share-based long-term incentive plan 2022-2024**
Caverion’s Board of Directors approved in December 2021 the commencement of PSP 20222024 and RSP 2022-2024. The performance targets for the plan were the relative total
shareholder return of the Company’s share and earnings per share. The targets for PSP 20222024 were partially met and reward will be paid in cash to key employees in early 2024. The
shortening of earning period by one year due to public tender offer will be taken into account
in reward payment on pro rata basis.

Within RSP 2022-2024, share allocations are made for individually selected key
employees in special situations. The reward will be paid in cash to key employees in early
2024.

**The effect of the share-based incentive plans on consolidated financial statements**
The consolidated financial statements include costs from share plans amounting to EUR 1.1
(2.6) million (excluding social costs). EUR 0.8 (1.0) million of the total cost recognised is
related to the Group Management Board.

As a result of the modification made, the consolidated financial statements include current
liability amounting to EUR 16.0 million relating to share plans. Of this, EUR 13.5 million
decreased the Group’s equity and EUR 2.5 million increased deferred tax assets. In addition,
bookings relating to share based payments, made before the modification, affect equity.

**Accounting principles**
Caverion's share-based incentive plans, which include a net settlement feature, were in principle
accounted for as fully equity settled plans until Q3/2023 even though Caverion pays the
withholding taxes in cash on behalf of the participants. The share-based incentive plans are
valued at their fair value on grant date and are recognised as an employee benefit expense over
the vesting period with corresponding entry in equity. The difference realised upon the settlement
date is also accounted for against equity.

The fair value of the share-based rewards is based on the market price of Caverion
Corporation's share at the grant date. Some of Caverion's share-based incentive plans also
contain market-based vesting conditions which are taken into consideration when determining
the fair value of the reward at grant date. For these, the reward's fair value is determined by
utilising the Monte Carlo simulation which reflects also the probability of not achieving the marketbased vesting condition. For the market-based vesting conditions, the expense is recognised
regardless of whether the condition is, in the end, satisfied. For non-market-based vesting
conditions, the achievement of the condition is taken into account in the number of shares which
are expected to vest at the end of the vesting period.

The accounting treatment of Caverion’s outstanding equity-settled share-based incentives
was changed in the third quarter of 2023 and a modification from equity-settled to cash-settled
classification in accounting under IFRS 2 Share-based Payment was made for all remaining
share-based incentive plans. In the modification, outstanding plans were measured at fair value
and the difference to previous valuation was booked decreasing equity.

We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the
_Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial_
_statements section of our report, including in relation to these_
matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of
procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks
of material misstatement of the financial statements. The
results of our audit procedures, including the procedures
performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for
our audit opinion on the accompanying financial statements.

We have also addressed the risk of management override
of internal controls. This includes consideration of whether
there was evidence of management bias that represented a risk
of material misstatement due to fraud.

###### Revenue recognition

_The accounting principles and disclosures concerning revenue recognition are disclosed in_
_Note 2.1._

In accordance with its accounting principles Caverion applies the percentage-of-completion

method for recognizing significant portion of its revenues.

The recognition of revenue by applying percentage-of-completion method and the

estimation of the outcome of projects require significant management judgment in estimating
the cost-to-complete as well as total revenues. From the financial statement perspective,
significant judgment is required especially when the project execution and the associated
revenues extend over two or more financials years.

The areas where significant judgment is required are more prone to the risk that the

assumptions may be deliberately misappropriated. Based on above, revenue recognition was
a key audit matter. This matter was also a significant risk of material misstatement referred to
in EU Regulation No 537/2014, point (c) of Article 10(2).


Our audit procedures to address the risk of material misstatement included:

   - Assessing of the Group’s accounting policies over revenue recognition of projects.

   - Examination of the project documentation such as contracts, legal opinions and other
written communication.

   - Analytical procedures and review of financial KPI’s as well as development of projects
by

       - reviewing the changes in estimated total revenues, cost-to-complete and
changes in reserves, and

       - discussing with the different levels of the organization including project,
division and group management.

   - Analyzing key elements in management’s estimates such as the estimated future
costs-to-complete and the estimated time necessary to complete the project.

   - Evaluating the appropriateness of the Group’s disclosures in respect of revenue
recognition.


###### Key audit matter How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter


###### Valuation of goodwill associated with German business operations

_The accounting principles and disclosures concerning goodwill are disclosed in Note 4.2._

The valuation of goodwill associated with German business operations was a key audit

matter

    - because the assessment process is judgmental, it is based on assumptions
relating to market or economic conditions extending to the future,

    - because of the significance of the goodwill 77,7 million euro to the financial
statements, and

    - as the management views that a reasonably possible change in key assumption
may result in an impairment.

German business operations form a one cash generating unit. The valuation of goodwill is

based on the management’s estimate about the value-in-use calculations of the cash
generating unit. There are number of underlying assumptions used to determine the value-inuse, including the revenue growth, EBITDA and discount rate applied on net cash-flows.

Estimated value-in-use may vary significantly when the underlying assumptions are

changed and the changes in above-mentioned individual assumptions may result in an
impairment of goodwill.


Our audit procedures regarding the valuation of goodwill in German business operation
included involving EY valuation specialists to assist us in evaluating testing methodologies,
impairment calculations and underlying assumptions applied by the management in the
impairment testing.

In evaluation of methodologies, we compared the principles applied by the management in

the impairment tests to the requirements set in IAS 36 Impairment of assets standard and
ensured the mathematical accuracy of the impairment calculations associated with German
business operations.

The key assumptions applied by the management were compared to

    - approved budgets and forecasts,

    - information available in external sources, as well as

    - our independently calculated industry averages such as weighted average cost of
capital used in discounting the cashflows.

We also assessed the sufficiency of the disclosures associated with the German business

operations.


-----

   - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding
the financial information of the entities or business
activities within the group to express an opinion on the
consolidated financial statements. We are responsible
for the direction, supervision and performance of the
group audit. We remain solely responsible for our
audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing
of the audit and significant audit findings, including any
significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during
our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence, and communicate with
them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably
be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable,
related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with
governance, we determine those matters that were of most
significance in the audit of the financial statements of the
current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We
describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or
when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a
matter should not be communicated in our report because the
adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be
expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such
communication.

###### Other Reporting Requirements Information on our audit engagement

We were first appointed as auditors by the Annual General
Meeting on 26 March 2018, and our appointment represents a
total period of uninterrupted engagement of 6 years.

###### Other information

The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are
responsible for the other information. The other information
comprises the report of the Board of Directors and the


###### Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director for the Financial Statements

The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are
responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial
statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted
by the EU, and of financial statements that give a true and fair
view in accordance with the laws and regulations governing the
preparation of financial statements in Finland and comply with
statutory requirements. The Board of Directors and the
Managing Director are also responsible for such internal control
as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of
financial statements that are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the Board of Directors
and the Managing Director are responsible for assessing the
parent company’s and the group’s ability to continue as going
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters relating to going
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting. The
financial statements are prepared using the going concern
basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the
parent company or the group or cease operations, or there is
no realistic alternative but to do so.

###### Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance on whether
the financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an
auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee
that an audit conducted in accordance with good auditing
practice will always detect a material misstatement when it
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of
users taken on the basis of the financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with good auditing
practice, we exercise professional judgment and maintain



- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement
of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or
error, design and perform audit procedures

responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,

misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the parent company’s or the group’s internal
control.

- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
and related disclosures made by management.

- Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of
Directors’ and the Managing Director’s use of the
going concern basis of accounting and based on the
audit evidence obtained, whether a material

uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that
may cast significant doubt on the parent company’s or
the group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If
we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the
related disclosures in the financial statements or, if
such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our
opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit
evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s
report. However, future events or conditions may
cause the parent company or the group to cease to
continue as a going concern.

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and
content of the financial statements, including the
disclosures, and whether the financial statements
represent the underlying transactions and events so
that the financial statements give a true and fair view.

the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. We
have obtained the report of the Board of Directors prior to the
date of this auditor’s report, and the Annual Report is expected
to be made available to us after that date.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the
other information.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our
responsibility is to read the other information identified above
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is
materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our
knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be
materially misstated. With respect to report of the Board of
Directors, our responsibility also includes considering whether


the report of the Board of Directors has been prepared in
accordance with the applicable laws and regulations.

In our opinion, the information in the report of the Board of
Directors is consistent with the information in the financial
statements and the report of the Board of Directors has been
prepared in accordance with the applicable laws and
regulations.

If, based on the work we have performed on the other
information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s
report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this
other information, we are required to report that fact. We have
nothing to report in this regard.

###### Report on Review of Caverion Corporation’s Interim Financial Information for the period 1 January 2024 – 31 March 2024

**To the Board of Directors of Caverion Corporation**

_Introduction_

We have reviewed the condensed interim financial information for Caverion Corporation, comprising the condensed
consolidated statement of financial position as of 31 March 2024, condensed consolidated income statement and
consolidated statement of comprehensive income, condensed consolidated statement of cash flows, consolidated
statement of changes in equity, and notes for the three-month period then ended. The Board of Directors and the
Managing Director are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the interim financial information in
accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 Interim Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express a
conclusion on this interim financial information based on our review.

_Scope of Review_

We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements ISRE 2410 Review of
_Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity. A review of interim financial_
information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and
applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would
become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit
opinion.

_Emphasis of matter – Adoption of 2023 financial statements_

We draw attention to the Note 1. Accounting principles to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements
which describes that the annual general meeting of Caverion Corporation is planned to be held on 12 June 2024.
Consequently, Caverion Corporation’s annual general meeting has not adopted the financial statements for the year
ended 31 December 2023. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

_Conclusion_

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the interim financial
information of Caverion Corporation has not been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34
_Interim Financial Reporting._

_Other matter_

This report has only been issued to be included in Assemblin Caverion Group AB’s offering memorandum. The
offering memorandum has been prepared in connection with initial issue of senior secured notes of Assemblin
Caverion Group AB and in connection with the subsequent listing of senior secured notes to The International Stock
Exchange.

Parent company Caverion Oyj has on 31 October 2023 become an additional borrower
and additional guarantor in Senior Facilities Agreement (SFA) executed between
Crayfish Bidco Oy and a group of banks. According to terms and conditions of the SFA,
the members of Caverion Group i.e. the parent company Caverion Oyj and its
subsidiaries are required to provide guarantees and securities to the lenders. Those
guarantees and securities may be limited in scope and substance. According to an
amendment to the Facilities Agreement, the initial guarantee requirement shall apply
only from 31 July 2024, and with the first such compliance to be by reference to the
Annual Financial Statements in relation to the Financial Year ending 31 December 2023.
The agreed security principles contain two tests that need to be fulfilled. Firstly, there is
material company requirement, which includes subsidiaries contributing 5% or more of
the consolidated EBITDA of the Group. Secondly, guarantor entities must together
equate to over 80% of the Group EBITDA. The above requirements only apply to entities
incorporated in Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark. Agreed security principles
require a security over the shares in a material company and over material
intercompany loans with a certain threshold. The total book value of such shares to be
included under the securities was EUR 221.3 million on 31 March 2024. There were no
material intercompany loans that meet the agreed security principles. Until Crayfish
BidCo Oy owns 100% of Caverion Group, guarantee granted by the Caverion Group shall
be limited to the amount of the facilities actually borrowed by members of Caverion
Group only, excluding the obligations of Crayfish BidCo Oy. This concerns the obligations
under the EUR 410 million term loan facility, EUR 75 million revolving credit facility and
EUR 65 million committed guarantee facility. After 100% ownership is reached, the

Entities participating in the demerger are jointly and severally responsible for the
liabilities of the demerging entity which have been generated before the registration of
the demerger. As a consequence, a secondary liability up to the allocated net asset
value was generated to Caverion Corporation, incorporated due to the partial demerger
of YIT Corporation, for those liabilities that were generated before the registration of the
demerger and remain with YIT Corporation after the demerger. Caverion Corporation
has a secondary liability relating to the Group guarantees which remain with YIT
Corporation after the demerger. These Group guarantees amounted to EUR 21.4 (20.8)
million at the end of March 2024.

Caverion Deutschland GmbH is currently facing a claim that has allegedly been filed with
a court during April 2024. Caverion, however, has not yet been officially served with this
claim. The claim, purportedly amounting to approximately EUR 27 million, relates to an
alleged breach of contract associated with a construction project that was initiated in
2015, and completed in 2021. The parties have been in dispute over this matter over
the past several years, during which time various attempts at settlement have been
made. As the court has not yet served the claim on Caverion, Caverion has not yet been
able to fully assess the claim and, as of March 31, 2024, no additional provisions have
been recognized in connection with the alleged court filing, pending further information
and analysis.

In the course of these discussions, Caverion had also prepared a claim which, at the
time, was not filed. Should the alleged claim be formally served upon Caverion, and
standard procedural steps commence, Caverion intends to defend its position and
present a counterclaim relating to damages for unpaid amounts and related claims.

The initial oral hearing for the anticipated litigation is not expected to take place until
late 2024. Following this hearing, the court is likely to offer a preliminary evaluation of
the claims, which may present a further opportunity for the parties to engage in
settlement discussions.
