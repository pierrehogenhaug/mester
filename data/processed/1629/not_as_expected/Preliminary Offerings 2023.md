Prospective purchasers who are QIBs are hereby notified that the seller of the securities offered under the
Offering Memorandum may be relying on the exemption from the provisions of section 5 of the Securities Act
provided by Rule 144A.

You are reminded that the Offering Memorandum has been delivered to you on the basis that you are a person
into whose possession the Offering Memorandum may be lawfully delivered in accordance with the laws of the
jurisdiction in which you are located and you may not, nor are you authorized to, deliver the Offering
Memorandum to any other person.

Under no circumstances shall the Offering Memorandum constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer
to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale
would be unlawful. If a jurisdiction requires that the offering be made by a licensed broker or dealer and the
Initial Purchasers (as defined herein) or any affiliate of the Initial Purchasers is a licensed broker or dealer in
that jurisdiction, the offering shall be deemed to be made by the Initial Purchasers or such affiliate on behalf of
the Issuer in such jurisdiction.

The Offering Memorandum has been sent to you in an electronic form. You are reminded that documents
transmitted via this medium may be altered or changed during the process of electronic transmission and
consequently none of the Initial Purchasers, the Issuer or any person who controls them or any of their respective
directors, officers, employees or agents accepts any liability or responsibility whatsoever in respect of any
difference between the Offering Memorandum distributed to you in electronic format and the hard copy version
available to you from the Initial Purchasers upon your request.

The Offering Memorandum has not been approved for the purposes of Section 21 of the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) by an authorized person under FSMA. In the United Kingdom, the attached
Offering Memorandum and any other material in relation to the securities described therein are being distributed
only to, and are directed only at, persons who are “qualified investors” (as defined in Article 2 of the UK
Prospectus Regulation) who are (i) persons having professional experience in matters relating to investments
falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005
(the “Financial Promotion Order”), or (ii) high net worth entities falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) of the
Financial Promotion Order, or (iii) persons to whom it would otherwise be lawful to distribute them, all such
persons together being referred to as “Relevant Persons.” The securities are only available to, and any invitation,
offer or agreement to subscribe, purchase or otherwise acquire such securities will be engaged in only with,
Relevant Persons. The Offering Memorandum and its contents are confidential and should not be distributed,
published or reproduced (in whole or in part) or disclosed by any recipients to any other person in the United
Kingdom. Any person in the United Kingdom that is not a Relevant Person should not act or rely on the Offering
Memorandum or its contents.


-----

No person may communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in
investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue
or sale of the securities other than in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the
Issuer (as defined herein). Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target
market assessment in respect of the securities has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the
securities is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as
amended, “MiFID II”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the securities to eligible counterparties and
professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the securities
(a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a
distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the
securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining
appropriate distribution channels.

The Notes described in the Offering Memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made
available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For
these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point
(11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended,
the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as
defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus
Regulation. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as
amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the securities described in the Offering
Memorandum or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore
offering or selling the securities described in the Offering Memorandum or otherwise making them available to
any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation. The Offering Memorandum has
been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in any Member State will be made pursuant to an
exemption under Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the Notes.
The Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold
or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (“UK”). For these purposes, a retail
investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of
Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; (ii) a customer within
the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement
Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8)
of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii)
not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the UK Prospectus Regulation. Consequently, no key
information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of
the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available
to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making
them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

The Offering Memorandum has been addressed to you in an electronic form. You are reminded that documents
transmitted electronically may be altered or changed during the process of electronic transmission and
consequently none of the Initial Purchasers, any person who controls any Initial Purchaser, or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees or agents accepts any liability or responsibility whatsoever in respect
of any difference between the Offering Memorandum accessed by you in electronic format and any version that
will be provided to you at a later date.

principal amount of its Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2029 (the “Notes”). The Notes will be issued by the Issuer under an indenture (the
“Indenture”), dated as of, 2023 (the “Issue Date”) entered into by, among others, the Issuer and the Trustee (as defined herein).

, 2023. The Notes will mature on, 2029. Prior to, 2024, the Issuer will be entitled at its option to redeem all or a
portion of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100 per cent. of the principal amount of the Notes plus the applicable “make whole” premium
described in this offering memorandum and accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. On or after, 2024,
the Issuer will be entitled at its option to redeem all or a portion of the Notes at the applicable redemption prices set forth under the heading “Description
_of the Notes – Optional Redemption” plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date._
In addition, the Issuer may redeem all, but not part, of the Notes at a price equal to 100 per cent. of the principal amount thereof (including accrued and
unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any) upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law. Upon the occurrence of certain defined
events constituting a change of control, each holder of the Notes may require the Issuer to repurchase all or a portion of its Notes at a price equal to 101
per cent. of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any. However, a change of control will not be
deemed to have occurred if a specified consolidated net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such event. See “Description of the Notes” for
further information.
The Notes will be senior secured obligations of the Issuer, and will rank senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s future debt that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and will rank pari passu in right of payment with the Issuer’s existing and future debt that is not so subordinated,
including the Issuer’s obligations under the Super Senior Facilities (as defined herein). On the Issue Date, the Notes will not be guaranteed. Within 90 days
following the Issue Date, subject to certain agreed security principles, the obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Notes will be guaranteed, jointly and
severally on a senior basis, by each subsidiary of the Issuer that is a guarantor under the Super Senior Facilities. The Notes Guarantees (as defined herein)
will rank senior in right of payment to the respective Guarantor’s (as defined herein) future debt that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to such
Notes Guarantee and will rank pari passu in right of payment with the respective Guarantor’s existing and future debt that is not so subordinated, including
such Guarantor’s obligations under the Super Senior Facilities. The Notes will be secured by a first-priority security interest in the same assets that secure
the Issuer’s and Guarantors’ obligations under the Super Senior Facilities, subject to certain agreed security principles and agreed exceptions. On the Issue

hedging obligations and certain other indebtedness permitted to be incurred on a priority basis under the Indenture, if any, have been repaid in full. The
validity, enforceability and, in respect of the security interests over the Collateral, priority and ranking of the Notes Guarantees and the security interests
and the liability of the Guarantors, are subject to the limitations described in “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests.” The Notes will be structurally subordinated to all obligations of the Issuer’s subsidiaries_
that do not guarantee the Notes and effectively subordinated to any existing and future debt of the Issuer and the Guarantors that is secured by property or
assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of such property and assets.
There is currently no market for the Notes. Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”) for the
listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”). There can be no assurance,
however, that the Notes will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the Notes will be granted or that such

instruments, as amended, or Article 2(1)(13A) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union
(Withdrawal) Act 2018.

###### NOTICE TO CERTAIN EUROPEAN INVESTORS

**PRIIPs Regulation/Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors. The Notes are not intended to be offered,**
sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail
investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or both) of: (i) a retail
client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); or (ii) a
customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II.
Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs
**Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA**

ix


-----

has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail
investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. This offering memorandum has been
prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in any Member State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an
exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the “Prospectus Regulation”) from the requirement to publish
a prospectus for offers of the Notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the
Prospectus Regulation.

**MiFID II Product Governance/Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market.** Solely for the
purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes,
has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and professional
clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible
counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or
recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration each manufacturer’s target market
assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market
assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining each manufacturer’s target market assessment)
and determining appropriate distribution channels.

###### United Kingdom

**Prohibition of Sales to UK Retail Investors. The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made**
available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United
Kingdom (“UK”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail
client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by
virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of the
provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU)
2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1)
of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently no key
information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of
the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available
to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making
them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

**UK MiFIR Product Governance / Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market. Solely for the**
purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes
has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined in
the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in
Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal)
Act 2018 (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and
professional clients are appropriate. Any distributor should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target
market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product
Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its
own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target
market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial

###### PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER DATA

 The Group

The “Group,” “Assemblin,” “we” or “us,” unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, (i) in
the context of the historical financial information and other operational and market data, the group of entities
comprising Assemblin Group AB (“Assemblin Group”), and all of its consolidated subsidiaries and (ii) in all
other contexts, the group of entities comprising the Issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries. Assemblin Group
is a direct subsidiary of the Issuer from May 3, 2023. See “Summary—The Transactions.”

**Issuer**

The Issuer was registered on March 21, 2023 and, as of the date of this offering memorandum, the Issuer has
no historical operations and its only material assets and liabilities are, and are expected in the future to be up
until the Optional Post-Closing Merger, if applicable, its interest in the issued and outstanding shares of its
subsidiaries, including Assemblin Group, and the Shareholder Bridge Loan. Therefore, no historical financial
information on the Issuer has been included in this offering memorandum.

###### Financial Statements

This offering memorandum includes unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of
Assemblin Group and its consolidated subsidiaries as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2023 (the
“Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements”) and audited consolidated financial
statements of the Assemblin Group and its consolidated subsidiaries for the financial years 2020, 2021 and 2022
(the “Audited Consolidated Financial Statements” and, together with the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated
Interim Financial Statements, the “Financial Statements”). As the Issuer has no material assets and liabilities
or historical results of operation, we believe that presenting Assemblin Group’s historical financial information
will assist investors in their understanding of our past performance and financial position. The historical
financial information provides valuable insights into the Group’s operating results, cash flows and key financial
metrics over the years presented, enabling investors to evaluate the Group’s growth trajectory, profitability
trends and overall financial stability.

The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU. The Financial Statements for the financial years 2020, 2021 and 2022
and for the three months ended March 31, 2023 were approved for issue by the Board of Directors of Assemblin
Group on May 31, 2023. The Financial Statements appear in the F-pages of this offering memorandum and
should be read in conjunction with the relevant reports of our independent auditor as such reports relate to the
Financial Statements.

Information is provided in this offering memorandum for the last twelve months ended March 31, 2023 (“the
**twelve months ended March 31, 2023” or “LTM”). The unaudited condensed consolidated statements of profit**
or loss and other comprehensive income information and the other financial information presented as of and for
the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 have been derived by subtracting from the financial information of
the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 the comparative
financial information of the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements as of and for the
three months ended March 31, 2022, and adding the financial information of the unaudited condensed
consolidated interim financial statements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The unaudited
condensed consolidated statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income presented for the twelve
months ended March 31, 2023 have been prepared for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily
representative of our results of operations for any future period or our financial condition at any future date.
This data has been prepared solely for the purpose of this offering memorandum and is not prepared in the
ordinary course of our financial reporting.

The financial information included in this offering memorandum is not intended to comply with the applicable
accounting requirements of the Securities Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC which would
apply if the Notes were being registered with the SEC.

The information included in this offering memorandum was not prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the Unites States (“U.S. GAAP”). There could be significant differences between
IFRS, as applied by us, and U.S. GAAP. We neither describe the differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP nor
reconcile our IFRS financial statements to U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, such information is not available to
investors, and investors should consider this in making their investment decision. The financial information
included in this offering memorandum would require the modification, reformulation or exclusion of certain
financial measures. In addition, changes would be required in the presentation of certain other information.

###### Non-IFRS Measures

We have included certain non-IFRS financial measures in this offering memorandum, including e.g. EBITA,
Adjusted EBITA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, and
certain financial ratios.

Under our presentation:

- “acquisition growth” means the first twelve months’ revenues from acquired units less the last twelve
months’ sales from divested units divided by revenues for the corresponding period in the preceding
year. This reflects the impact on revenues of the acquired or divested units.

- “Adjusted EBITA” means EBITA adjusted for items affecting comparability, which are categorized as
acquisition, integration and start-up costs, restructuring costs, transformation costs and other items
affecting comparability, as described under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Items Affecting_
_Comparability of Results of Operations.” Adjusted EBITA on a segment basis is presented before_
intragroup eliminations.

- “Adjusted EBITDA” means Adjusted EBITA before depreciation of property, plant and equipment and
right-of-use assets.

- “Adjusted EBITA Margin” and “Adjusted EBITDA Margin” mean Adjusted EBITA and Adjusted
EBITDA, respectively, divided by net revenue for the period, expressed as a percentage.

- “Cash Conversion” means Free Cash Flow divided by Adjusted EBITA.

- “Changes in Net Working Capital” means the operating cashflow relating to the sum of the increase
or decrease in inventories, the increase or decrease in operating receivables, and the increase or decrease
in operating liabilities and reversal of changes in paid provision for the relevant period.

- “currency effects growth” means Growth attributable to the currency effect of the translation of
revenues in foreign operations.

- “EBITA” means profit for the year/period excluding income taxes, net financial items and amortization
of intangible assets. EBITA on a segment basis is presented before intragroup eliminations.

- “EBITA Margin” means EBITA divided by net revenue for the period, expressed as a percentage.

- “Free Cash Flow” means Adjusted EBITDA, less the sum of lease accounting adjustments, Changes in
Net Working Capital, Net Capital Expenditures before vehicle leases and vehicles lease capital
expenditure for the period.

xiii


-----

- “Growth” means the changes in net revenue for the period in relation to net revenue for the
corresponding period in the preceding year.

- “Net Capital Expenditures” means investments in intangible and tangible fixed assets, less the sales
value (cash proceeds) of tangible and intangible fixed assets for the period, and including net cash
outflow for leased vehicles, which primarily relate to our car fleet.

- “Net Working Capital” means the sum of inventories, net work in progress, total trade receivables,
prepaid expenses and accrued income, other receivables, trade payables, other current liabilities and
accrued expenses and prepaid income, excluding unpaid purchase consideration on acquisition of
subsidiaries and accrued interest expenses as of the relevant date.

- “Order backlog” means the remaining revenue expected to be recognized from ongoing projects subject
to existing contractual commitments as of the end of the relevant period.

- “Order intake” means the revenue expected to be recognized on projects from (i) new contractual
commitments entered into during the relevant period, plus (ii) changes during the relevant period to
existing contractual commitments entered into during prior periods.

- “organic growth” means Growth excluding currency effects growth less acquired growth.

- “Pro Forma Adjusted EBITA” means Adjusted EBITA further adjusted to reflect the pro forma EBITA
contribution of certain acquisitions that were completed after April 1, 2022, but prior to March 31, 2023,
as if such acquisitions had completed on April 1, 2022.

- “Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA” means Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted to reflect the pro forma
EBITDA contribution of certain acquisitions that were completed after April 1, 2022, but prior to March
31, 2023, as if such acquisitions had completed on April 1, 2022.

We present EBITA, Adjusted EBITA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITA and Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA and other non-IFRS measures referred to above because we believe they assist investors and analysts
in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not
believe are indicative of our core operating performance.

The foregoing measures have limitations as analytical tools. Some of these limitations are:

- they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual
commitments;

- they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

- they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service interest
or principal payments on our debt;

- although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized
will often need to be replaced in the future and Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITA, Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA and similar non-IFRS financial measures do not reflect any cash requirements
that would be required for such replacements;

- some of the large and unusual expenses we eliminate in calculating EBITA, Adjusted EBITA, Adjusted
EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and similar non-IFRS financial
measures reflect cash payments that were made; and

xiv


-----

- the fact that other companies in our industry may calculate EBITA, Adjusted EBITA, Adjusted EBITDA,
Pro Forma Adjusted EBITA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and similar non-IFRS financial measures
differently than we do, which limits their usefulness as comparative measures.

We present EBITA, Adjusted EBITA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITA, Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA and other non-IFRS measures as we believe they will be useful to investors and analysts in reviewing
our performance and comparing our results to other operators. However, neither EBITA, Adjusted EBITA,
Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA nor the other non-IFRS
measures are IFRS measures and you are encouraged to evaluate any adjustments to IFRS measures yourself
and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. You should not consider EBITA,
Adjusted EBITA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITA or Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (a) as an
alternative to operating profit/loss as a measure of our operating performance; (b) as an alternative to cash flow
from operating and investment activities as a measure of our ability to meet cash needs; or (c) as an alternative
to any other measure of performance under IFRS. Because of these limitations, as well as further limitations
discussed above, the non-IFRS measures presented should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for
performance measures calculated in accordance with IFRS. We compensate for these limitations by relying
primarily on our results in accordance with IFRS and using non-IFRS measures only supplementally.

###### Rounding

Certain numerical figures set forth in this offering memorandum, including financial data presented in millions
or thousands, certain operating data or percentages describing market shares, have been subject to rounding
adjustments and, as a result, the totals of the data in this offering memorandum may vary slightly from the
actual arithmetic totals of such information. Percentages and amounts reflecting changes over time periods
relating to financial and other data set forth in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
_and Results of Operations” are calculated using the numerical data in the consolidated financial statements of_
the Group or the tabular presentation of other data (subject to rounding) contained in this offering memorandum,
as applicable, and not using the numerical data in the narrative description thereof.

###### INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA

Unless otherwise indicated, statements in this offering memorandum regarding the market environment, market
developments, growth rates, market trends and the competitive situation in the markets and segments in which
we operate are based on data, statistical information, sector reports and studies as well as on our own estimates.

In preparing this offering memorandum, we used industry sources and sources on market data, including reports
prepared by an independent third-party consultant and Prognoscentret AB (“Prognoscentret”).

To the extent that information was taken from third parties, such information has been accurately reproduced
by us in this offering memorandum and, as far as we are aware and able to ascertain from the information
published by these third parties, no facts have been omitted which would render the reproduced information
inaccurate or misleading. However, market studies and analyses are frequently based on information and
assumptions that may not be accurate or technically correct, and their methodology may be forward-looking
and speculative.

We have not verified the figures, market data and other information used by third parties in the studies,
publications and financial information reproduced herein, or the external sources on which our estimates are
based. We therefore assume no liability for and offer no guarantee of the accuracy of the data from studies and
third-party sources contained in this offering memorandum or for the accuracy of third-party data on which our
estimates are based.

This offering memorandum also contains estimates of market data and information derived from such data that
cannot be obtained from publications by independent sources. Such information is partly based on our own
market observations, the evaluation of industry information (such as from conferences and sector events) or
internal assessments. We believe that our estimates of market data and the information we have derived from
such data helps investors to better understand the industry in which we operate and our position within it. Our
own estimates have not been checked or verified externally. While we assume that our own market observations
are reliable, we give no warranty for the accuracy of our own estimates and the information derived from them.
They may differ from estimates made by our competitors or from other independent sources. While we are not
aware of any misstatements regarding the industry or similar data presented herein, such data involves risks and
uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, including those discussed under the heading
“Risk Factors” in this offering memorandum. As a result, neither we nor the Initial Purchasers make any
representation as to the accuracy or completeness of any such information in this offering memorandum.

contributing bank indications and the ask rate is set to the lowest ask rate offered by these banks. The Bloomberg
Generic Composite Rate is a mid-value rate between the applied highest bid rate and the lowest ask rate. The
rates may differ from the actual rates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and other
financial information appearing in this offering memorandum. None of the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Initial
Purchasers represent that the Swedish krona or euro amounts referred to below could be or could have been

###### Overview

We are one of the Nordic region’s leading providers of smart and sustainable installation and service solutions,
with our primary activities focusing on electrical engineering, heating & sanitation, ventilation and smart
buildings & automation, such as building management systems (“BMS”) and individual metering and debiting
(“IMD”), as well as key competencies in data & telecoms, industrial pipes, district heating, cooling, sprinklers,
security and green technology solutions (“GreenTech”).

We hold a strong position in the growing installation market in the Nordic countries in which we operate
(comprising Sweden, Norway and Finland), which are estimated at approximately SEK 125 billion, SEK 90
billion and SEK 66 billion, respectively, and have a combined approximate value of SEK 282 billion as of
December 31, 2022. In 2021, within the installation and service market, we were the third largest company in
the Nordic countries in which we operate (comprised of Sweden, Norway and Finland), the second largest
company in Sweden, the third largest company in Norway and the seventh largest company in Finland, in each
case based on revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 according to an independent third-party
consultant. Our multi-technical offering, market share and size have enhanced our position as a competent and
trusted partner that provides reliable and efficient high-quality services in the context of an ongoing
transformation towards a more energy-efficient and sustainable society.

We provide design, installation, maintenance and service solutions for a wide range of properties, industrial
facilities and infrastructure projects for a diverse customer base consisting of over 20,000 large and small
customers, which include construction companies, the public sector, property owners and industrial companies.
Our installation business consists of the installation of technical systems as part of the construction of new
properties and the renovation or upgrade of technical systems as part of the reconstruction and renovation of
properties, improving their functionality and comfort. Our design and maintenance capabilities complement
our installation business. Lastly, our service business consists of the operation, maintenance, repair,
replacement, reconfiguration and monitoring of technical installations in buildings, industrial plants and
infrastructure. Our strong relationships with our customers have contributed to an order backlog of SEK 9,115
million and an LTM order intake of SEK 12,836 million, respectively, as of March 31, 2023, and we currently
have over 3,000 ongoing projects as of March 31, 2023. We take on primarily two types of assignments:
contractor assignments and service assignments. The proportion of contractor assignments and service
assignments represented 58 per cent. and 42 per cent., respectively, of our net revenue for the twelve months
ended March 31, 2023.

Our operations are decentralized and governed based on a shared framework, clear allocation of roles and
responsibilities and systematic monitoring. Our current operating organization is divided into five specific
business areas: three in Sweden (Assemblin Electrical, Assemblin H&S and Assemblin Ventilation), one in

1


-----

Norway (Assemblin Norway) and one in Finland, which also includes BMS products and IMD operations in
Sweden and Norway (Assemblin Finland), comprising approximately 199 branches with approximately 6,890
FTE employees in the Nordic region as of March 31, 2023. We believe that our decentralized business model
contributes to the profitability of our operations. This decentralized and entrepreneurial business model allows
us to swiftly adjust to a largely variable cost structure and promotes enterprise and accountability at all levels
of our structure, with the president of each business area being responsible, together with their management
groups, for the operations and earnings in their respective business areas.

The following map shows our branch footprint, representing the locations in which we operated in the Nordic
region as of March 31, 2023.

We have been owned by Triton since 2015, and since then have expanded our geographical presence and
volumes through the acquisition of 75 additional companies to date (55 of which were since January 1,
2020), the largest of which was our 2016 acquisition of Skanska Installation, a carve-out from the broader
construction company Skanska. Our organic and inorganic growth has made us into a complete installation and
service partner, with the strength of a multidisciplinary group and the personal presence of a local company.

In the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, we had total net revenue of SEK 14,089 million, a net profit for
the period of SEK 434 million, EBITA of SEK 1,030 million, Adjusted EBITA of SEK 1,005 million and Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA of SEK 1,304 million. This was supported by our strong order backlog, which
stood at SEK 9,115 million as of March 31, 2023.

The table below sets out the net revenue, Adjusted EBITA (and corresponding margin), order backlog, share of
service assignments, average number of FTE employees and number of branches for each of our business
areas as of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023.

###### Competitive Strengths

 A leading Nordic platform with strong market positions and local densities

We are the second largest installation and service provider in Sweden (with an 8 per cent. market share,
compared to 11 per cent. for the first largest competitor, 7 per cent. for the third largest competitor and 4 per
cent. for the fourth largest competitor), and the third largest within the installation and service market in the
Nordic countries in which we operate (with a 5 per cent. market share, compared to 7 per cent. for each of the
first and second largest competitors, respectively, and 4 per cent. for the fourth largest competitor), all based on
revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, as measured by an independent third-party consultant.

Our wider group and local scale provide differentiating competitive advantages. At the business area level, we
are able to utilize our procurement expertise to optimize sourcing supplier terms within each business area and
leverage on our digital capabilities. At the business area level, we also have strong HR, financial and business
development functions complementing resources on a regional and local level. In addition, on a Group level,
we leverage certain central functions such as finance, legal, communication and our central IT platform.

At the local level, our geographic network comprises approximately 199 branches in close proximity to
customers in selectively targeted markets: nation-wide in Sweden, the greater Oslo area in Norway and the
Helsinki-Turku-Tampere triangle in Finland. Moreover, we strengthened our footprint in Finland in 2021
through the acquisitions of Fidelix and Tom Allen Senera. In certain locations, our business areas share branch
premises, which allows for significant cross-selling and cost-reduction opportunities. In addition to being better
positioned to win local tenders, our cross-staffing ability between branches allows us to optimize project
selection. Further, our local scale has allowed us to build a workforce of approximately 6,890 FTE employees
in the Nordic region as of March 31, 2023, with many of our employees preferring to work for a larger, but
decentralized, company such as ourselves due to supportive and clear governance, stability, brand awareness
and personal development opportunities.

Along with holding a leading market position across the Nordic countries in which we operate, we have a strong
local leadership position, as reflected by the diagram below showing the percentage of our revenues for the year

###### Attractive market growth supported by accelerating long-term megatrends

We operate in a growing market, which is estimated by an independent third-party consultant to grow at a
compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 5 per cent., from 2022 to 2025, reaching a combined approximate
value of SEK 334 billion in 2025 (assuming SEK/EUR exchange rate of 10.8). The Nordic installation and

4


-----

service market's growth is driven by a number of positive trends driving investments in the space, including: (i)
regulatory tailwinds; (ii) reinforced need for renovation; and (iii) transition to smart buildings. In the service
market in particular, which has become a growing focus of our business, the key drivers are expected to include:
(i) cost inflation (estimated 4 per cent. CAGR contribution from 2021 to 2024), as service contracts generally
include mechanisms to pass-through inflation to customers; (ii) growth in building stock (estimated 0.1 per
cent. CAGR contribution from 2021 to 2024), as growth in underlying building stock drives an increase in the
number of installations, and therefore service requirements; (iii) the COVID-19 rebound (estimated 1 per cent.
CAGR contribution from 2021 to 2024), as services suffered during the COVID-19 pandemic due to sick leave,
and restrictions on site work, balanced by a market rebound to pre-COVID levels due to pent up demand; and
(iv) service intensity and outsourcing propensity (estimated 1 per cent. CAGR contribution from 2021 to 2024),
as increased intensity and complexity drives the need for more frequent and qualified services, as well as
increased outsourcing. (Source: Independent third-party consultant.)

Sustainability has also become increasingly important, as evidenced by the European Union’s target to be
climate-neutral with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Improving energy efficiency in buildings
through efficient technical installation solutions and BMS will play an important role in reaching these targets,
as buildings account for approximately 40 per cent. of the European energy consumption (according to the
European Commission). In addition, the increased focus on sustainability drives demand for installation and
service of heat pumps, solar panels, systems for other renewable energy sources and energy storage.
Digitalization underpinned by rapid technological advancement creates new opportunities within the
installation and service industry, where BMS play an integral role in the construction of smart buildings. In
addition, larger populations in urban centers, and limited available space, drives demand for larger and more
complex buildings, requiring more installation work, maintenance and service of systems. Furthermore, societal
trends such as changing consumer demands, the general evolution of the real estate market and a comprehensive
reorganization of office spaces triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic also supports growth in our markets. We
believe that these trends will drive increased volume and complexity in technical installations, thereby driving
growth in our markets.

###### Highly resilient business model underpinned by exposure to resilient end-markets, significant revenue diversification and a flexible cost base

The Nordic installation and service market has historically been relatively resilient during economic downturns.
For example, the renovation and services segment in the Nordic market during the 2008-2009 financial crisis
experienced slow growth, rather than a decline, and the service segment was only moderately impacted by the
COVID-19 pandemic. Renovation and new build projects continued growing throughout the COVID-19
pandemic and the service market suffered only a slight contraction due to the difficulty experienced by service
technicians in gaining access to work-sites and buildings due to pandemic restrictions (rather than demanddriven factors).

Our presence across a diverse set of end-markets with a high share of service assignments further enhances our
resilience. A large part of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 originated from cycle-resilient
end-markets such as healthcare (10 per cent.), education & culture (6 per cent.), infrastructure (3 per cent.) and
service assignments (42 per cent.). Moreover, we have limited exposure to the residential market as, for the year
ended December 2021, approximately 14 per cent. of our end-market exposure was attributable to contractor
assignments in the residential market, with new residential builds representing a portion of it. (Source:
_Independent third-party consultant.) For the year ended December 13, 2021 and based on sales, approximately_
30 per cent. of the Nordic installation and service market was made up of new builds, 25 per cent. of service
assignments and 44 per cent. of renovation assignments. (Source: Independent third-party consultant.) Other
factors that add to our resilience are our order backlog of committed orders that allows us the planning horizon

5


-----

to adjust our cost base and project margins after dips in the construction market, and the long-term nature of
our service assignments.

We also have limited dependency on a specific customer or type of contract. According to our management’s
estimates, our top ten customers accounted for approximately 22 per cent. and our top 3 customers accounted
for 14 per cent. of net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. Furthermore, we have limited exposure
to large contracts that would expose us to material risk from any one project. Based on net revenue for the year
ended December 31, 2022, contractor assignments (which include both installation projects as well as certain
service projects subject to percentage of completion accounting) over SEK 50 million, between SEK 10-50
million, between 5-10 million and less than 5 million represented 10 per cent., 18 per cent., 10 per cent. and 20
per cent. of our net revenues, respectively, and the remaining 42 per cent. of our net revenues were derived from
service assignments.

In addition to resilience from diversified exposures across end-markets, customers and contracts, we also benefit
from a high level of visibility in our business model. Installation is the last part of the typical construction
project, so branch managers are able to identify early signs in the changes of market dynamics and adjust our
cost base, which is approximately 89 per cent. variable or semi variable in nature for the year ended December
31, 2022, as necessary. This variable cost base is driven by our minimal overhead costs and fixed assets and our
cost-base is inflation protected given the short duration of the majority of our projects (less than one year on
average) and service, and pass-through mechanisms and long durations in our service contracts. Our ability to
proactively manage or swiftly react to such changes in market dynamics is supported by our lean and
decentralized operational organization. Our order book of contractor assignments enhances near-term visibility
which has consistently stayed above 100 per cent of last twelve months of project revenues since the year ended
December 31, 2019 and a high and growing share of recurring services that has increased from 38 per cent.
during the year ended December 31, 2019 to 42 per cent. during the twelve months ended March 31, 2023. We
take a consistent approach to order booking and only include signed contracts in our order backlog. Our order
backlog is also conservatively stated as we are able to pass through inflationary effects to our customers rather
than adjusting backlog upwards.

###### A proven ability to navigate an inflationary environment

Even in an inflationary environment, our contract structures drive our ability to achieve our desired level of
profitability. According to management estimates for Sweden and Norway, approximately 65 per cent. of our
contracts are structured with a cost-plus pricing approach giving us the ability to pass through input price
inflation onto our customers. We are also able to mitigate inflationary pressures on the remaining approximately
35 per cent. of revenue under fixed price contracts with its typically short-term contract length and an optimized
central procurement system, which allows us to accurately estimate costs whilst bidding for contracts.

The diagram below shows our management’s estimate of our revenues by contract type during the year ended
December 31, 2022.

(1) Estimates are indicative and based on management’s review with local managers in Sweden and Norway of contracts that were
expected to be delivered in 2022.

(2) Management believes it is able to reflect the impact of inflation in its pricing of service assignments (including driven by the
small and short term-nature of some of the service assignments). In management’s opinion, small and short-term service
assignments are cost plus in nature as they allow for a high conviction view on the impact of inflation on expected costs, and
pricing is set accordingly to secure a desired level of profitability.

We have maintained and continued to expand our margins in recent periods despite the inflationary backdrop,
as construction cost inflation has increased in Sweden from 8.5 per cent. for the six months ended June 30, 2021
to 14.9 per cent. for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

###### Operating model underpinned by disciplined local entrepreneurship coupled with a relentless focus on operational excellence

We believe that our decentralized business model, structured around technical disciplines and supported by
strong leadership teams creates a distinct competitive advantage compared to other players in the market. The
division of our business into technical disciplines allows managers and their teams to focus on growing
operations within their areas of expertise. This structure also provides career development opportunities for
talented employees within their respective business lines and promotes sharing of experiences, competences,
and best practices. Furthermore, we believe that it is more attractive for acquired companies to be integrated
into a business area focused on the same technical discipline as themselves, and our structure facilitates the
efficient integration of acquired companies.

Within each business area, we promote an “entrepreneurial” culture. Branch managers are expected to drive
margin improvement and lead a specialized and skilled workforce. Typically, branch managers are selected
based on their personnel management skills and previous project manager experience. Branch managers receive
financial incentives in the form of bonuses based on Adjusted EBITA Margin and working capital levels. The
size of these bonuses depends on the size of the branch, the manager’s monthly salary, and the portion of
Adjusted EBITA Margin above a pre-determined threshold. This underpins our cultural focus on margins over
volumes and creates strong disincentives for managers to take on low-margin or high-risk contracts. Branch
managers' success is linked to their in-depth local market knowledge and strong customer relationships,
supported by specialist functions at regional, business area and to some extent group level (including design
and tendering, legal, procurement, HR, finance, ESG and communication).

-----

We believe that our decentralized business model contributes to the profitability of our operations, and that it
increases commitment from its employees and local managers. While each business area develops its own
practices, we maintain a strong shared culture based on core values, guiding principles and fundamental ethical
standpoints set forth in our Code of Conduct.

The success of our business model is evidenced by our track record of margin improvement. We have
successfully increased our Adjusted EBITA margin over the past six years from around 3 per cent. during the
year ended December 31, 2017 to 7.1 per cent. in the last twelve months ended March 31, 2023. The
comprehensive nature of our operational excellence is evident in our improving margins at the individual branch
level. We have reduced the proportion of loss-making branches in our network from approximately 30 per cent.
in 2017 to 14 per cent. in 2022. At the same time, the proportion of branches delivering over 10 per cent.
Adjusted EBITA Margin increased from 12 per cent. to 26 per cent. over the same period. The diagram below
shows the split of our branches by profitability, measured as the number of branches that have an Adjusted
EBITA margin of less than 0 per cent., between 0 per cent. and 2.5 per cent., between 2.5 per cent. and 7.5 per
cent., between 7.5 per cent. and 10.0 per cent. and over 10.0 per cent., for the year ended December 31, 2022,
compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.

(1) Excludes divested and discontinued branches in LTM period

-----

This margin improvement has been achieved through the implementation of systematic project selection criteria
and process management measures, the replacement of underperforming branch managers and projects and
closure of non-performing branches and a corporate culture focused on profitability over volume. We also
maintain structured follow-up and reporting procedures, user-friendly business intelligence tools for
performance monitoring and EBITA and NWC-based employee incentives on a branch level. To help us
continually monitor our profitability enhancement measures, we track the following KPIs across our
organization:

Despite this improvement, we believe we will continue to have opportunities to increase our margins through
our organizational structure and strong profitability focus. We plan to continue to incentivize our branch
managers to seek margin enhancement initiatives on a local branch level to drive operational efficiency
improvements and further cost consciousness.

Following Triton’s acquisition of the Group, we have pursued a strategy of small-scale and accretive bolt-on
acquisitions in order to expand our business. Future potential targets may range from smaller accretive
investments to material acquisitions. We believe that the fragmentation in the markets in which we serve
provides a broad opportunity to continue consolidating with a deep and actionable pipeline of profitable targets
by paying a multiple of approximately 4-6 times the target’s EBITA, with an average target EBITA margin of
12 per cent. (both based on acquisitions closed between 2017 and 2022 and excluding Tom Allen Senera and
Fidelix). This acquisition strategy allows us to strengthen our local competitive position, broaden the range of
our offering and increase our presence in existing markets, with a particular focus on targets supporting our
smart and sustainable solution offering. We carefully select actionable targets, by prioritizing potential
acquisitions on; independent ownership, profitability, culture and sustainable performance. We believe we are
an acquirer of choice for potential targets, due to our decentralized organizational set-up and our strong
employer reputation complemented by deep local relationships.

Our acquisition history by number of acquisitions and estimated total aggregate annual sales between 2017 and
the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 is presented below:

(1) For the twelve months ended March 31, 2023.

(2) Management’s conservative estimate of sales for the full year following the acquisition, based on the historical financials of each
acquired entity and the due diligence performed.

By leveraging our strong local network and understanding of the market, we are able to source approximately
76 per cent. of our acquisitions by approaching a target outside of any formal process, such as bilaterally or
through our Assemblin platform. The remaining transactions have been sourced through brokers (approximately
24 per cent.), mostly through exclusive processes (approximately 21 per cent.) and occasionally in competitive
processes (approximately 3 per cent.).

We have a strong and successful track record of integrating acquired entities into our business and a proven
acquisition strategy based on finding high quality targets with strong cultural compatibility, a structured
acquisition process and non-disruptive integration.

###### A focused ESG and digital strategy with a comprehensive proposition positioning the platform for the future

We believe that we are well positioned to benefit from the expected growth in higher margin segments of the
Nordic installation and service market, such as smart buildings, GreenTech, and niche segments including
mainly fire and security, sprinklers, cooling and refrigeration. Following our acquisition of Fidelix in September
2021, we are the only large installation player with a sizeable offering providing end-to-end BMS solutions in
the Nordic region. According to an independent third-party consultant, our 2020 market share by revenue of 8
to 10 per cent. in the smart buildings segment in Sweden and Finland was approximately twice the market share
of the second largest installation company (at 4 to 6 per cent.), while the third and fourth largest players were
estimated to have a market share of 3 to 5 per cent. and less than 2 per cent., respectively.

We believe that our position as a sizable player within the BMS segment with strong technical competence and
end-to-end integration solutions, combined with its proprietary product offering provides a competitive
advantage. We can offer complete bespoke solutions to customers, from design to installation and subsequent
servicing of the systems.

Furthermore, we have a strong GreenTech offering, which includes resource-efficient products and solutions to
improve energy efficiency and optimization, solar panel installations, renewable heating solutions and electric

10


-----

vehicle charging solutions, and BMS solutions. We have enhanced our GreenTech offering through the
acquisitions of Tom Allen Senera, a Finnish provider of energy optimized systems for buildings including,
among others, geothermal solutions, and Electrotec Energy, an experienced solar panel installation provider
with experience in solar cells and energy storage. Through our BMS and GreenTech offering, we are strongly
positioned to support our customer’s smart building, digitalization and energy transition.

Beyond being an ESG enabler for customers, we are also committed to achieving our own ESG targets,
including plans to reduce CO2 emissions (scope 1 and 2) by 50 per cent. by 2030 and achieve climate neutrality
by 2040.

Additionally, we have a strong focus on governance that is centered around a solid governance model, employee
safety and a sustainable community around us. During the three year period ended December 31, 2022, our
average voluntary personnel turnover was only 11.2 per cent. compared to 13.2 per cent. for our top 2 listed
competitors, as presented in their public reporting.

###### Cash-generative and resilient financial profile with high revenue visibility from late-cycle presence, order backlog and recurring service contracts

We have improved our Adjusted EBITA margin over the past six years from around 3 per cent. during the year
ended December 31, 2017 to 7.1 per cent. in the twelve months ended March 31, 2023. Our ability to address
market demand and new customer orders as well our focus on empowering branch managers and providing
fixed services at the Group level have enabled us to improve profitability.

Our high cash flow generation has been driven by capital-lite operations together with efficient working capital
management. Our operations require very limited capital expenditure and lease expenses, which primarily
comprises tools, vehicles, refurbishment and IT, with Net Capital Expenditure including vehicle leases
representing 1.4 per cent. of net revenue for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023. We have a high focus
on working capital management across the Group. Our ability to generate Free Cash Flow has contributed to
our growth and has allowed us to undertake a successful acquisition strategy. Our successful and proven
business model, combined with well-established long-term customer relationships, will enable us to continue
to achieve profitable growth and deleverage going forward.

###### Experienced management team leading a value oriented business

Our decentralized network is managed by a highly experienced management team, consisting of professionals
with strong backgrounds and operational expertise within technical installation and service solutions, and a
proven track record of acquiring and integrating new businesses, with strong leaderships centered around
technical disciplines. Our CEO and President, Mats Johansson, has significant experience in leading
management roles in large companies within the construction and installation market, and our CFO, Philip
Carlsson, contributes his strong transactional and financial experience in the Nordics as well as experience in
another installation company, while our Head of Communication and Sustainability, Åsvor Brynnel, has a strong
background in the real estate and Nordic service sector. In addition, most of our business areas presidents have
over 20 years of installation industry experience and a long tenure with us. Under their leadership, we have had
a successful track record of margin expansion, completed numerous acquisitions, and have positioned the us as
a leading installation company in the Nordic region. We believe that the combination of highly experienced
management teams, both at the Group as well as at the branch level, provides us with a key advantage in
continuing to seek growth and development of each business area and for the Group.

###### Our Strategy

 Grow the service business across the Group

We have transitioned from a mainly project-focused organization to establishing separate local service
organizations with dedicated service managers, increased the hiring of service technicians and also established
separate tracking measures and employee- and manager margin-linked incentives.

Service revenue has shown strong growth with a CAGR of 15 per cent. between 2019 and the last twelve-month
period ended March 31, 2023. This growth was particularly driven by “service champions”, i.e., branches
growing services-sourced revenue above 15 per cent. year-on-year. Between 2019 and the last twelve-month
period ended March 31, 2023, our service revenue has grown at a CAGR approximately 1.3 times its project
revenue CAGR. We expect that growth in our service revenues will increase our bottom line, as our service
assignments tend to have higher margins than our contractor assignments.

We aim to drive further growth in the services business by: (i) applying best practices developed by service
champions across our entire branch network; (ii) identifying, attracting, training, retaining and motivating a
sufficient number of highly skilled technical employees, which we consider to be a key factor to grow the
relatively personnel-dependent service business across the Group; (iii) strengthen the coordination of our sales
teams to increase project-to-service sales conversion; and (iv) enhance key account management activities to
increase the number of larger services customers assignments.

###### Continue to focus on profitable growth by lifting performance across the Group's branch network

We are determined to grow our business profitably and sustainably, fulfilling our potential by increasing market
share and winning new contractor assignments and service contracts without compromising on profitability.

We are well positioned to grow our market shares in Sweden, Norway and Finland by continuing to provide
high-quality services and by focusing on strengthening local operations. We intend to continue to operate a
large, decentralized organization, with local branch units operating as individual profit centers, and to uplift
margins in average and underperforming branches. Due to our decentralized organization, branch performance
and the ability to improve branch profitability margins are highly dependent on attracting, retaining and
motivating key employees, including branch managers. We evaluate branch performance issues through a
comprehensive set of key performance indicators, such as employee competence, contract execution, order
intake, procurement performance, service portfolio management, overhead management and invoicing/cash
collection procedures, and addresses performance issues through a tailored action plan. Specifically, we aim to
improve margins at average and underperforming branches through: (i) a strong focus on active performance
management of local operations; (ii) employee education and skill enhancement initiatives (including training
and monitoring courses for technicians to drive upselling and better leverage our brand); (iii) branch governance
improvements including; among others, improved tendering procedures and an efficient internal scorecard
process; (iv) the accelerated deployment of digital tools, including financial transparency tools, both on a branch
as well as on a project level; (v) accelerated project-to-service revenue conversion (by means of enhanced
indicator-tracking and follow-up procedures); and (vi) expanding to new untapped customers (based on a
systematic customer base analysis to identify high potential accounts and leveraging branch best practices for
new customer conversion as well as tracking customer conversion at a Group level).

Our Finnish operations are an area of our business where there is particularly large growth potential from
operational improvement programs. The Assemblin Finland business area has continuously improved,
becoming profitable in 2018 following a management change and successful acquisitions. Results of operation
in Finland were partially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic but during 2020 we focused on streamlining
operations, such as through adjusting our cost base and cutting less profitable branches, which resulted in
significant improvements in our margins in 2021. In 2022, we faced challenges with supply chain delays and

12


-----

project write-downs, which impacted our margins negatively. Our Adjusted EBITDA Margin for the twelve
months ended March 31, 2023 of 3.1 per cent., however, was a significant improvement from our margin of 1.9
per cent. for the year ended December 31, 2022.

We have a strong record of historic margin improvements across our business in part due to our efforts to
improve profitability and cut costs across the Group and maximizing margins remains one of our long term
growth strategies.

###### Accelerate our proven and margin accretive acquisition strategy

We continuously evaluate new opportunities to acquire installation and technical services providers in the
Nordic region in order to strengthen our local competitive position, complement our offering and consolidate
our presence in attractive market segments. We have proven experience in identifying, executing and integrating
other companies, while remaining committed to our existing business model and values. To complement our
business strategy, we focus on targets with high margins, paying a multiple of approximately 4-6 times the
target’s EBITA, with an average target EBITA margin of 12% (both based on acquisitions closed between 2017
and 2022 and excluding Tom Allen Senera and Fidelix). In order to grow through margin accretive acquisitions,
we need to maintain operating agility and a strong ability to react to changing market dynamics, including a
potential increase in competition for the acquisition of attractive targets (which could result in higher purchase
price multiples). We have differentiated acquisition capabilities which cover the full cycle of an acquisition
process from the screening phase (by means of decentralized deal sourcing by business areas), to execution
(through a Group acquisition team providing execution bandwidth) and including post-closing integration (by
means of tailored toolboxes and governance solutions).

###### Accelerate growth in new expanding segments, building on strategic investments

Over a number of years, we have strengthened our position by complementing our traditional focus on technical
disciplines such as electrical, heating and sanitation, and ventilation, with growth in the smart buildings market
segment, GreenTech solutions, and other niche segments such as cooling and refrigeration (which typically
have higher growth and margins than the overall installation market). We expect to further expand our share in
these markets by combining our expertise with the capabilities of the companies acquired in recent years such
as Fidelix, Tom Allen Senera and Electrotec Energy. Electrotec Energy and Tom Allen Senera have strengthened
our offering of sustainable installation solutions, particularly in the areas of installation of solar panels and
energy storage (through the installation, maintenance and servicing of panels and energy storages) and heat
pumps (through a diversified product range including ground space, air to water and exhaust air implementing
installation with storage solutions), while the acquisition of Fidelix has enhanced our position in the BMS
market segment.

###### The Transactions

**_The Continuation Fund Transfer_**

The Issuer entered into a sale and purchase agreement dated May 3, 2023, relating to the sale and purchase of
the whole of the issued share capital of Assemblin Group AB (the “Acquisition”), with Assemblin Group AB’s
previous parent company, Ignition MidCo S.a.r.l., as seller, and the Issuer, as buyer, for a total purchase price
of €518.8 million (the “Purchase Price”). The Acquisition was a part of a larger transfer of assets from Triton
Fund IV to Triton IV Continuation Fund (the “Continuation Fund Transfer”). The Purchase Price was funded,
in part, by an equity contribution by the Issuer’s immediate parent, Apollo Swedish Holdco AB, to the Issuer of
€393.8 million and a shareholder bridge loan (the “Shareholder Bridge Loan”) of €125.0 million from Apollo
Swedish Holdco AB, as lender, to the Issuer, as borrower. The Continuation Fund Transfer, and consequently
the Acquisition, were completed on May 3, 2023, after which Assemblin Group AB became a direct subsidiary
of the Issuer.

-----

After the Issue Date, there may be a merger, acquisition or other combination between all, or any assortment
of, the Issuer, Assemblin Group AB, Assemblin Holding AB and Assemblin AB (the “Optional Post-Closing
**Merger”).**

**_The Refinancing_**

The proceeds of the Offering will be used to (i) redeem the Existing Notes and repay the Shareholder Bridge
Loan, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, any repayment premiums, as applicable, and any related fees, costs,
taxes and expenses and (ii) pay fees and expenses related to the Offering (the “Refinancing”). See “Use of
_Proceeds.” The Refinancing and the Continuation Fund Transfer are collectively hereinafter referred to as the_
“Transactions.”

###### Recent Developments

 Bolt-on Acquisitions

Since April 1, 2023, we have completed an additional 3 small “bolt-on” acquisitions, one in Assemblin
Electrical (Elia AB) and two in Assemblin Norway (electrical company Fjorden Elektro AS and ventilation
company Ingeniørfirmaet R. Torgersen AS). These companies have a total of approximately 100 employees and
estimated aggregated annual revenues of SEK 290 million. The acquisitions completed after March 31, 2023
and prior to the Issue Date, and were made with cash on balance sheet. See Note 3 to the Unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Interim Financial Statements and Note 33 to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. See
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors
_Affecting Our Results of Operations—Acquisitions.”_

###### Trading Update

Collateral owned by such Guarantor, to the extent of the
value of such Collateral; and

######  be effectively subordinated to any existing and future
indebtedness of each Guarantor that is secured by property
or assets that do not secure the Notes Guarantees on an
equal basis, to the extent of the value of the property or
assets securing such indebtedness.

The Notes Guarantees will be subject to release under certain
circumstances. See “Description of the Notes—Guarantees.”

**Security** On the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured by the following,
subject to certain agreed security principles and agreed
exceptions:

######  the issued Capital Stock of the Issuer;

  the issued Capital Stock of Assemblin Group AB;

  certain long-term material intra-Group loans (in respect of
which the Issuer is a creditor), with a final maturity date or
intended tenor in excess of 12 months and with a principal
amount in excess of €20 million (or its equivalent in other
currencies) in aggregate to a Restricted Subsidiary as
debtor (if any);

19


-----

######  existing and future shareholder loans owed by the Issuer to
its immediate Parent; and

######  the Issuer’s material operating bank accounts (but
excluding any escrow, cash collateral, blocked and pooling
accounts, accounts connected with any Bank Products,
accounts in connection with any receivables financing
(including discounting or factoring or similar), any
guarantee or letter of credit financing, or similar) (if any),

(together, the “Issue Date Collateral”).

Within 90 days of the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured by
the following, subject to certain agreed security principles and
agreed exceptions:

######  the issued Capital Stock of the remaining Guarantors;

  certain of the Guarantors’ material operating bank accounts
(but excluding any escrow, cash collateral, blocked and
pooling accounts, accounts connected with any Bank
Products, as defined in _“Description of the Notes”,_
accounts in connection with any receivables financing
(including discounting or factoring or similar), any
guarantee or letter of credit financing, or similar) (if any,
and only to the extent that such bank accounts are required
to be secured under the Super Senior Facilities
Agreements);

######  certain long-term material intra-Group loans (in respect of
which a Guarantor is a creditor), with a final maturity date
in excess of 12 months and with a principal amount in
excess of €20 million (or its equivalent in other currencies)
in aggregate to another Guarantor as debtor (if any); and

######  certain of the Guarantors’ business mortgages (but only to
the extent in existence prior to the date of the Super Senior
Facilities Agreements and to the extent they will secure the
Super Senior Facilities Agreements,

(the “Post-Closing Collateral” and, together with the Issue
Date Collateral, the “Collateral”).

**Intercreditor Agreement** Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the first-priority
security interests securing the Notes will be contractually
deemed to rank equally with the security interests that secure (but
only to the extent that such security is expressed to secure those
liabilities) (i) obligations under the Super Senior Facilities
(which includes the Pension Guarantee Facility and the
Guarantee Facility), (ii) certain obligations under hedging
arrangements and (iii) certain other future indebtedness and
obligations permitted to be incurred under the Indenture. Such
security interests are, or will be, evidenced by security
documents for the benefit of (whether directly or through the
Security Agent) the holders of the Notes, the lenders under the

20


-----

Super Senior Facilities and/or the holders of certain other future
indebtedness or obligations permitted to be incurred under the
Indenture. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement,
subject to certain conditions, in the event of acceleration of the
Super Senior Facilities or the Notes, amounts recovered in
respect of the Notes, including from the enforcement of the
Collateral, will be required to repay indebtedness in respect of
the Super Senior Facilities, certain future indebtedness and
obligations permitted under the terms of the Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement to rank pari passu with the Super Senior
Facilities and future hedging obligations (if any) in priority to the
Notes, following the payment of fees and expenses of the agent
under the Super Senior Facilities, the Trustee and the Security
Agent (and any receiver or delegate) and any fees and expenses
of any other creditor representative of future indebtedness
permitted under the terms of the Indenture to benefit from such
security interests.

The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the relevant
security unless instructed by the relevant Instructing Group (as
defined in the Intercreditor Agreement). The relevant Instructing
Group or such other class of creditors as specified by the
Intercreditor Agreement may, under certain conditions, be
entitled to instruct the Security Agent to enforce the relevant
security subject to, and in accordance with, the provisions of the
Intercreditor Agreement. In the event of conflicting instructions,
the Intercreditor Agreement contains provisions as to which set
of instructions will prevail. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

**Additional Amounts** Any payments made by the Issuer or any Guarantor with respect
to the Notes or the Notes Guarantees will be made without
withholding or deduction for or on account of taxes unless
required by law. If the Issuer or the Guarantors are required by
law to withhold or deduct amounts for or on account of tax
imposed by a relevant taxing jurisdiction with respect to a
payment to the holders of Notes, the Issuer or the relevant
Guarantor will, subject to certain exceptions, pay the additional
amounts necessary so that the net amount received by the holders
of the Notes after the withholding or deduction is not less than
the amount that they would have received in the absence of the
withholding or deduction. See “Description of the Notes—
_Withholding Taxes.”_

**Use of Proceeds** On or about the Closing Date, we expect to use the gross
proceeds of the Offering to redeem the Existing Notes, repay the
Shareholder Bridge Loan and to pay fees and expenses related to
the Offering. See “Use of Proceeds.”

**Optional Redemption** Prior to    , 2024, the Issuer will be entitled at its option to
redeem all or a portion of the Notes at a redemption price equal

21


-----

to 100 per cent. of the principal amount of the Notes plus the
applicable “make whole” premium described in this offering
memorandum and accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding,
the redemption date.

On or after    , 2024 the Issuer will be entitled at its option to
redeem all or a portion of the Notes at the applicable redemption
prices set forth under the heading “Description of the Notes—
_Optional Redemption,” plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but_
excluding, the redemption date.

**Optional Redemption for Tax Reasons** In the event of certain developments affecting taxation which
cause the Issuer to pay additional amounts, the Issuer may
redeem the relevant Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time,
at a redemption price of 100 per cent. of the principal amount,
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and additional amounts,
if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. See
“Description of the Notes—Redemption for Taxation Reasons.”

**Change of Control** Upon the occurrence of certain events defined as constituting a
change of control, the Issuer may be required to offer to
repurchase all outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash equal
to 101 per cent. of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and
unpaid interest to the date of purchase. A change of control will
not be deemed to have occurred if a certain consolidated net
leverage ratio is not exceeded as a result of such event, see
“Description _of_ _the_ _Notes—Change_ _of_ _Control”_ and
“Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions—Specified
_Change of Control Event.”_

**Certain Covenants** The Indenture, among other things, will restrict the ability of the
Issuer and the restricted subsidiaries of the Issuer to:

######  incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain
preferred stock;

######  create or incur certain liens;

  make certain payments, including dividends or other
distributions, with respect to the shares of the Issuer;

######  prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity;

  make certain investments;

  create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of
dividends or other distributions, loans or advances to and
on the transfer of assets to the Issuer or its restricted
subsidiaries;

######  sell, lease or transfer certain assets including stock of
restricted subsidiaries;

######  engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

  consolidate or merge with other entities; and

22


-----

######  impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of
the Notes.

Each of these covenants is subject to significant exceptions and
qualifications. See “Description of the Notes—Certain
_Covenants.”_

**Transfer Restrictions** The Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been, and will not
be, registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of
any other jurisdiction and are subject to restrictions on
transferability and resale. See “Transfer Restrictions.” We have
not agreed to, or otherwise undertaken to, register the Notes
(including by way of an exchange offer) with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission.

**No Prior Market** The Notes will be new securities for which there is currently no
established trading market. Although the Initial Purchasers have
advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes, they
are not obligated to do so and they may discontinue market
making at any time without notice. Accordingly, there can be no
assurance that an active trading market will develop for the
Notes.

**Listing** Application will be made to the Authority for the listing of and
permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the
Exchange. There can be no assurance, however, that the Notes
will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that such
permission to deal in the Notes will be granted or that such listing
will be maintained.

**Governing Law** The Indenture and the Notes will be governed by the laws of the
State of New York. The Intercreditor Agreement will be
governed by the laws of England and Wales. Each Security
Document will be governed by applicable local laws.

**Trustee** Deutsche Trustee Company Limited.

**Security Agent** Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch.

**Paying Agent** Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch.

**Transfer Agent** Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch.

**Registrar** Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A.

**Calculation Agent** Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch.

**Listing Agent** Carey Olsen Jersey LLP.

**Risk Factors** Investing in the Notes involves substantial risks. See the “Risk
_Factors” section of this offering memorandum for a more_
complete description of certain risks that you should carefully
consider before investing in the Notes.

###### SUMMARY CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION

The following summary consolidated financial information of the Group as of and for the years ended December
31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 have been derived from the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included
elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

The following summary condensed financial information of the Group as of and for the three months ended
March 31, 2023 and 2022, have been derived from the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial
Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

The unaudited condensed statement of comprehensive income information and the other financial information
presented for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 have been derived by subtracting from the financial
information of the audited consolidated financial statements for the year December 31, 2022, the comparative
financial information of the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the three months
ended March 31, 2022, and adding the financial information of the unaudited condensed consolidated interim
financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

The unaudited condensed consolidated statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income information
and the other financial information presented for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 have been prepared
for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily representative of our results of operations for any future
period or our financial condition at any future date. In particular, the unaudited financial information for the
twelve-month period ended March 31, 2023 is not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for
the year ended December 31, 2023 and should not be used as the basis for, or a prediction of, an annualized
calculation. This data has been prepared solely for the purpose of this offering memorandum and is not prepared
in the ordinary course of our financial reporting.

The unaudited as adjusted and pro forma consolidated financial information presented in this section has been
prepared to illustrate the effect of the Transactions and certain other adjustments, as the case may be, on certain
consolidated financial information as of and for the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2023. The
information, which has been produced for illustrative purposes only, by its nature addresses a hypothetical
situation and, therefore, does not represent the Group’s actual financial position or results, nor do they purport
to project our financial position at any future date or our results of operations for any future period. None of the
as adjusted and pro forma consolidated financial information and underlying assumptions has been audited,
reviewed or verified by an independent accounting firm or other third party. The actual results may differ
significantly from those reflected in the as adjusted and _pro forma_ consolidated financial information for a
number of reasons, including, but not limited to, differences in assumptions used to prepare the as adjusted and
_pro forma consolidated financial information._

The Group’s consolidated financial information and other data should be read in conjunction with the
information contained in “Use of Proceeds,” “Capitalization,” “Summary Consolidated Financial and Other
_Information,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and_
the Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

Notes:

(1) The unaudited financial data for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 has been derived by subtracting the consolidated financial information for the
three months ended March 31, 2022 from the consolidated financial information for the year ended December 31, 2022 and adding the consolidated
financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The financial information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 has been
prepared for illustrative purposes only, is not necessarily representative of our results of operations, cash flows or financial position for any future period
at any future date, and is not prepared in the ordinary course of our financial reporting.

(2) EBITA, Adjusted EBITA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and other ratios derived therefrom are
non-IFRS measures. We define EBITA as profit for the year/period before income taxes, net financial items and amortization of intangible assets. We
define Adjusted EBITA as EBITA before items affecting comparability, which are categorized as acquisition, integration and start-up costs, restructuring
costs, transformation costs and other items affecting comparability, as described under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
_and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Items Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations.” We define_
Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITA before depreciation of property, plant and equipment. We define Pro Forma Adjusted EBITA and Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITA or Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, further adjusted to reflect the pro forma EBITA and pro forma EBITDA
contribution, respectively, of certain acquisitions that were not consolidated for the full twelve months ended March 31, 2023. Investors should not
consider EBITA, Adjusted EBITA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITA or Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (a) as an alternative to operating
profit/loss as a measure of our operating performance, (b) as an alternative to cashflow from operating and investment activities as a measure of our
ability to meet cash needs or (c) as an alternative to any other measure of performance under IFRS. EBITA, Adjusted EBITA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as presented in this offering memorandum may not be comparable to similarly titled measures
reported by other companies due to differences in the way these measures are calculated. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—

define Cash Conversion as Free Cash Flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA.

Changes in Net Working Capital is defined as the operating cashflow relating to the sum of the increase or decrease in inventories, the increase or
decrease in operating receivables, and the increase or decrease in operating liabilities and reversal of changes in paid provision for the relevant period.

_materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including_
_the risks described below and elsewhere in this offering memorandum._

###### Risks Related to Our Business and Industry

 Our business may be adversely affected by difficult economic conditions and other factors beyond our control

Our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the Nordic, European and global economies.
The demand for some of our services tends to be cyclical and can be significantly lower in an economic
environment characterized by lower household income and corporate earnings, lower levels of government and
business spending and slowdowns in the construction industry. Demand for our services depends in particular
on spending in residential and commercial construction in the Nordic region as well as renovation and
maintenance in industrial and infrastructure markets in that region, and a prolonged period of slow growth or
economic contraction may reduce demand for our services. The level of activity in these end-markets depends
on a variety of factors that we cannot control, including:

  - local, regional and global economic conditions, slowdowns and recessions;

  - the policies of the countries in which we operate, including the policies of the central banks of Sweden,
Norway and Finland;

  - the policies of transnational institutions, such as the European Central Bank and other institutions of
the European Union, which influence the performance of national economies in countries in which we
operate;

  - the impacts of any future pandemic outbreaks which may lead to lockdowns that restrict mobility and
economic activity; and

  - the level of demand in construction and in manufacturing and process industries, demographic trends,
capital spending and consumer confidence.

Unfavorable developments with respect to any or all of these or other factors can have a material impact on the
demand for the services that we offer, both in terms of decreased volumes and price levels.

Certain of these economic fluctuations may also come about from the changing political landscape. For
example, the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine by Russia that commenced in 2022 led to significant volatility in
financial markets and an increase in the prices of commodities, especially of energy products, for which Russia
holds a considerable share of the global market, which contributed to rising inflation rates in many countries
and supply chain disruptions, resulting in higher costs of raw materials, labor, and other essential resources
required for the Group’s operations. As a result, we may face challenges in sourcing materials at affordable
prices. See “—Fluctuating commodity prices, including as a result of geographical conflict or macroeconomic
_factors, may adversely impact our results of operations”. This can lead to increased costs of our services, which_
may ultimately be passed on to the clients, making projects more expensive and potentially less attractive.

36


-----

Although the Group does not have business activities or interests in either Russia or Ukraine, these events have
negatively affected the stability of the region and wider European continent and could have an adverse effect
on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

Additionally, our results of operation are impacted by changes in monetary and fiscal policy. See “—Changes
_in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results of operations.” On a_
macroeconomic scale, global credit and financial markets have recently experienced extreme volatility and
disruptions, including diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence and
economic growth, high inflation in Europe and other foreign markets, increases in unemployment rates and
uncertainty about economic stability. In response, central banks in major economies started increasing
benchmark interest rates in 2022, a process which may continue throughout this year and beyond. This could
result in, among other effects, decreased demand for our products by making it more difficult for our customers
to secure financing for projects on favorable terms and can, along with high inflation, decrease consumers’
disposable income. Additionally, higher interest rates increase our debt burden and if the current equity and
credit markets deteriorate, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult to complete, more
expensive or more dilutive. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms
could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy and financial performance.

One of our market drivers is activity in the new construction market, which is sensitive to general business and
economic conditions both regionally and worldwide, including the availability of credit, interest rates, inflation,
fluctuations in capital, the credit and mortgage markets, changes in tax laws affecting the real estate industry,
unemployment levels, and business and consumer confidence. The demand for some of our services is cyclical
to the construction market and correlates with swings in construction demand. The installation market is latecyclical, meaning that it correlates to some extent with the construction market but with less volatility and with
a time lag, given that periods of less new construction at the same time benefit from increased demand for
renovation and service assignments. The economic slowdown which commenced in 2022 saw a decline in new
housing production towards the end of the year and postponement of a limited number of planned projects.
While there are countervailing factors that serve to stabilize the installation market, a prolonged recessionary
environment can negatively affect both new construction and the installation market.

We provide the majority of our services to the renovation and maintenance and related services markets, which
have historically been more resilient to macroeconomic changes and can tend to be countercyclical. Private
residential spend, as well as other sectors of the installation market, can be affected by high mortgage
delinquency and foreclosure rates and limitations in the availability of home improvement financing, which
may limit consumers’ spending during economic downturns, particularly on discretionary items, and affect their
confidence level, leading to continued reduced spending on home improvement projects. The impact of these
economic factors specific to the renovation and maintenance market may be further exacerbated by
unemployment levels.

Furthermore, as a result of pandemics or adverse public health developments, such as the COVID-19 pandemic,
our operations and those of our customers, subcontractors and suppliers, may experience delays, disruptions
and other adverse effects, such as suspension or reduction of operations, declines in sales activities, difficulties
in travel and communications, and regulatory restrictions, any of which could have a material adverse impact
on us as a result of, for example, a further reduction in demand for our services, delays and uncertainties in
project timelines, deteriorations in the ability of our customers and subcontractors to serve their contractual
obligations due to liquidity constraints or other financial difficulties. See “—Our success depends on effective
_project and site management, which could be impaired by a certain number of factors.”_

As a result, adverse developments in global financial markets, geopolitical events and general business and
economic conditions, including economic recessions, downturns or negative developments, pandemic
outbreaks or general weakness in the economies of the Nordic countries could adversely affect demand for our

3

products and services, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash
flows and results of operations.

###### We may not be able to successfully manage future growth

Our ability to manage our growth and integrate operations, technologies, services and personnel depends on
our administrative, financial and operational controls and our ability to create the infrastructure necessary to
exploit market opportunities for our services, as well as our financial resources. In order to compete effectively
and to grow our business profitably, we will need, on a timely basis, to maintain and improve our financial and
management controls, reporting systems and procedures, implement new systems as necessary, attract and retain
adequate management personnel, and hire, retain and train a highly qualified workforce. Furthermore, we expect
that as we continue to introduce new services and enter new markets, we will be required to manage an
increasing number of relationships with various customers and other third parties. This would typically require
us to attract, train and retain increasing numbers of highly skilled technical personnel and branch managers.
The failure or delay of our management in responding to these challenges could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and result of operations.

###### We operate in highly competitive markets

The market for installation and services is highly competitive. There are currently a large number of small, local
companies and a smaller number of relatively large regional, national and multinational companies operating
in our markets. We also expect that new competitors may develop over time as smaller enterprises become more
established and reliable and refine their service capabilities. The local market is highly fragmented with low
barriers to entry and our local branches compete with a large number of relatively small local installers and
service providers, some of which benefit from better operating efficiencies or lower overhead costs than us. As
a result, some of our competitors are able to offer lower prices than us and we may not be able to effectively
utilize our larger size and broader capabilities as a competitive advantage when competing for local
assignments.

Competition varies depending on business area, customer classification and geographic area. The principal
competitive factors in our business include the following:

  - the availability and cost of materials and supplies;

  - technical product knowledge and expertise as to application and usage;

  - consulting and other service capabilities;

  - the ability to build and maintain customer relationships and positive customer experiences;

  - a focus on safety;

  - the effective use of technology to identify net revenue and operational opportunities;

  - same-day delivery capabilities for certain services

  - a capacity to perform work according to a customer’s desired schedule; and

  - the pricing of services and the provision of credit.

Some of our current or future competitors may have greater resources or lower price discipline than we do, and
may use this advantage to further increase their market share. Competitors may also engage in aggressive
pricing tactics, which may lead to us having to reduce our prices in order to compete with them. For example,
in instances where new construction has declined, we have been subject to increased competition on smaller
projects due to increased price competition from local companies. Furthermore, we may expend significant time
and resources in order to prepare a bid or participate in a bidding process, at the end of which we may not be
retained. Even if we are awarded a contract, it may not yield the expected results. As a result of high competition,
therefore, we may not be able to maintain our competitive position in the markets in which we operate and our

38


-----

net revenue, profitability and market shares may decline, which would have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

In addition, the nature of the markets in which we compete may attract new entrants, particularly from countries
with low-cost employment. Although we consider this risk to be relatively limited, in part, due to significant
levels of unionization and professional qualification requirements for workforce engaged in the installation and
services industry, competition with service providers that benefit from lower cost structures may challenge our
competitive position. Furthermore, in recent years, new construction methods have led to the introduction of a
range of new low-cost installation solutions. For example, as low-cost prefabricated housing construction
becomes more common, the demand for prefabricated building and housing components with pre-built lowcost installations may increase, which may have an adverse impact on the demand for our services. If we are
unable to respond to these shifts in demand, our sales may decline, which could have an adverse effect on our
financial condition and results of operations.

Increased industry competition could result in increased price competition, lower profit margins, a decline in
our market share and greater competition for qualified personnel. If we were to face such competition, our net
revenue, profitability and market shares may decline, which would have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

###### Our competitors continue to consolidate, which could cause the markets in which we operate to become more competitive and could negatively impact our business

There has been an increase in consolidation activity among our competitors in the markets in which we operate
due to several factors, such as customer need, supplier capabilities and competitive recognition of the benefits
of acquisition fueled growth, such as the ability to compete for larger projects and demand more beneficial
terms from suppliers. Should this continue, it could cause our markets to become more competitive as greater
economies of scale are achieved by our competitors. Customers are increasingly aware of the total costs of not
having access to consistent sources of supply at multiple locations. While we believe these customer needs
could result in fewer numbers of competitors in the market, as our remaining competitors become larger and
capable of supplying their services on a more consistent and comprehensive basis, these consolidated
competitors may increase competition along the value chain.

We may fail to effectively participate in the industry consolidation for a variety of reasons, including antitrust
restrictions, which may limit the degree to which a large market participant such as us can acquire additional
competitors, as well as our substantial indebtedness, and we may not have the resources to compete for such
acquisitions. In addition, industry consolidation could make it more difficult for us to maintain operating
margins and could also increase competition for our acquisition targets and result in higher purchase price
multiples. We may also face increased difficulty in growing and maintaining our market share and increasing
our growth prospects.

###### Our growth strategy involves acquisitions, and we may experience difficulties identifying acquisition targets, integrating acquired businesses and achieving anticipated synergies

Growth through acquisitions is one of our key growth strategies. We regularly identify and evaluate acquisition
opportunities. Since January 1, 2020, we have completed the acquisitions of an additional 55 companies in
Sweden, Norway and Finland and across each of our business areas, including 17 in Assemblin Electrical, 14
in Assemblin H&S, 6 in Assemblin Ventilation, 9 in Assemblin Finland and 9 in Assemblin Norway. See
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors
_Affecting Our Results of Operations— Acquisitions.” We may enter into binding agreements to acquire_
additional businesses that we expect to complement or augment our existing operations, including ones that
may be considered material acquisitions (such as the recently completed acquisition of Fidelix. There can be
no assurance, however, that suitable acquisition targets, particularly those that have the cultural fit and

profitability that we seek out, will be identified in the future, or that we will be able to finance such acquisitions
on favorable terms. Furthermore, acquisitions we have already made or future acquisitions may not be
integrated successfully into our operations and may not achieve desired financial objectives.

Financial sponsors and strategic buyers active in the same field as us and operating a similar acquisition strategy,
such as Instalco, Bravida and Nimlas Group, may make it difficult to find suitable acquisition targets and/or to
acquire these targets at attractive prices. There is a risk that we could pay more than an acquired company, or
its assets, is worth. Occasionally, due to merger control laws and regulations, the applicability of which depend
on the turnover of the acquisition target and our relative market position, a contemplated acquisition may be
subject to approval by relevant competition authorities and/or certain conditions may need to be fulfilled prior
to completion of the acquisition. For example, our recent acquisition of Fidelix, which was completed in
September 2021, was subject to approval by the Finnish Competition and Consumer Authority (Fi. Kilpailu-ja
_kuluttajavirasto). To receive final approval, we had to prepare a divestment plan to address an identified_
competitive situation. If we fail to find attractive acquisition targets, or if such targets may only be acquired on
terms that are not commercially viable, it could have an adverse effect on our ability to implement our growth
strategy, which may affect our competitiveness and lead to an adverse effect on our results of operations.

Any acquisitions of businesses entail numerous operational and financial risks, including:

  - higher than expected acquisition and integration costs;

  - the possibility that we could pay more than the acquired company or its assets are worth;

  - the possibility that we may not identify appropriate acquisition targets, complete future acquisitions
on satisfactory terms or realize expected synergies or cost savings within expected timelines;

  - unforeseen expenses, delays or conditions may be imposed upon the acquisition, including due to
required regulatory approvals or consents;

  - exposure to unknown liabilities;

  - difficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of acquired businesses with our existing
operations and personnel;

  - diversion of management’s attention from our day-to-day business;

  - impairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers of acquired businesses due to changes in
management and ownership and the restructuring of logistics and IT systems;

  - the inability to retain key employees of acquired businesses;

  - difficulty avoiding labor disruptions in connection with any integration, particularly in connection with
any headcount reduction; and

  - the incurrence of substantial debt.

The occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
condition.

In addition, there can be no assurance that, following integration into our Group, an acquired operation will be
able to maintain its customer base consistent with expectations or generate the expected margins or cash flow.
Although we analyze each acquisition target, our assessments are subject to a number of assumptions
concerning profitability, growth, interest rates and company valuations. We may have difficulties in
implementing our business model within an acquired company due to various factors, including conflicting
corporate culture. There can be no assurance that our assessments of and assumptions regarding acquisition
targets will prove to be correct and actual developments may differ significantly from our expectations.

In agreeing to acquire entities, we generally make certain assumptions and determinations on, among other
things, future net revenue and earnings, based on our investigation of the respective businesses and other
information then available. We cannot assure you that our assumptions and determinations will prove to be

correct or that liabilities, contingencies or other risks previously not known to us will not arise. Further, to the
extent there are breaches of any purchase agreement governing an acquisition, we may not be able to fully
enforce such breach of representations and warranties or to fully recover for losses we sustain as a result. In
addition, we may be limited in our ability to acquire companies depending on the concentration of ownership
in specific markets and our relative market position. Any such unanticipated risks, liabilities, contingencies,
losses or issues, if realized, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

Furthermore, acquisitions of companies expose us to the risk of unforeseen obligations with respect to
employees, customers, suppliers and subcontractors of acquired businesses, public authorities and other parties.
We cannot ensure that there will not be unexpected risks or obligations. Such obligations, were they to
materialize, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

###### New disruptive business models and increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from stakeholders with respect to our environmental, social and governance practices may expose us to new or additional risks

In recent years, technological development and increasing demands in the end-market for an efficient and
economic construction process have increased demands on suppliers, installation and service providers,
building contractors and other parties in the Nordic installation and service market value chain. These demands
are also related to the heavy carbon footprint of the construction industry. In parallel, new construction methods
have led to the introduction of a range of new low-cost installation solutions. For example, as low-cost
prefabricated housing construction becomes more common, the demand for prefabricated building and housing
components with pre-built low-cost installations may increase, which may have an adverse impact on the
demand for our services. If we are unable to respond to these shifts in demand, the requests for our services
may decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.

We have adopted certain practices, policies and common standards to define our environmental, social and
governance (“ESG”) approach in order to deliver long-term social, environmental and economic values across
our business. However, investors may expect us to implement additional or different ESG standards or goals,
such as reducing our carbon footprint by cutting CO2 emissions faster than initially planned, in order to maintain
their investments or before making any further investments in us. These expectations may be caused or
accentuated by new disruptive business models in our industry, incorporating elements such as new
technologies, working procedures and price models. As a result, we may be required to implement more
stringent ESG targets or standards so that our existing and future investors and lenders remain invested and
make further investments in us. If we are not effective in addressing ESG matters or achieving relevant
sustainability goals, trust in us may suffer and our business and/or our access to capital could be harmed. In
addition, we may incur additional costs and require additional resources for monitoring and reporting in order
to comply with increasing ESG requirements. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and financial position.

###### Security threats, security breaches or any significant failure or interruption of our IT systems could adversely affect our business

We use and are dependent upon information systems and other technology to conduct and manage our business.
We rely on IT systems to monitor, administer and bill our services, communicate with our customers, manage
our employees and gather information upon which our management team bases their decisions on in relation to
our operations. The administration of our business is increasingly dependent on the use of these systems. Our
ability to efficiently run and monitor our decentralized organization is dependent on a well-functioning
information technology system integrated throughout the organization. In order to manage our growth and
improve our performance, we must maintain and continuously upgrade and improve these technology systems

-----

and processes. We may not be able to develop and implement, on a timely basis, projects, systems, procedures
and controls required to support the growth and development of our operations. If we are unable to manage our
growth and improve our performance, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be
materially adversely affected.

As a result, system failures or disruptions resulting from computer viruses, hackers or other causes could have
an adverse effect on our business. We have initiated a review to improve our security levels in certain respects.
Any shortcomings in this review or any other unresolved security deficiencies may be exploited by hackers or
malicious actors and lead to system disruptions in our IT system, loss of data or may affect our operations in
other respects.

Data security breaches and other data security incidents may also result from internal threats, such as theft,
misuse, unauthorized access or error by employees, contractors and other third parties with otherwise legitimate
access to our systems. Given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of IT disruptions, there can be
no assurance that any security procedures and controls that we have implemented will be sufficient to prevent
cyberattacks from occurring. We may not be able to detect a breach of our systems in a timely manner, or at all,
and, even if we are able to detect such breach, we may be unable to remedy such incident in a timely manner,
or at all, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Any security breach or
incident that we experience could result in unauthorized access to, misuse of or unauthorized acquisition of our
users’ data, the loss, corruption or alteration of this data, interruptions in our operations or damage to our
computers or systems. We may have to expend significant capital and resources to mitigate the impact of such
an incident and to develop and implement protections to prevent future occurrences. Breaches of our systems
may also subject us to fines, penalties, litigation and government action, each of which may negatively impact
our business.

In addition, pursuant to contracts with third-party vendors, we outsource the operation and maintenance of
certain of our IT systems to effectively manage our IT resources and improve cost efficiencies. As a result, we
rely on our outsourcing partners to deliver these services. Their failure to perform satisfactorily could have a
material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

###### Anticipated pro forma adjustments to our financial information may not materialize as anticipated

We present certain information herein on the basis of certain estimates and assumptions to present for the twelve
months ended March 31, 2023 management’s estimate of, among other things, the pro forma full twelve-month
impact of certain acquisitions that were completed prior to and after March 31, 2023, in each case, as if such
acquisitions had completed on April 1, 2022 (based on each acquired entity’s historical EBITA or EBITDA, as
the case may be, derived from its management accounts, as adjusted for its actual contribution to our results of
operations since the date of its acquisition and as further adjusted in a manner consistent with our presentation
of financial information to the extent applicable and the application of our accounting policies and other items).
See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations— Key Factors
_Affecting Our Results of Operations—Acquisitions.”_

Each of the adjustments is based on our current estimates, and involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions and
other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any
anticipated future results. None of the as adjusted and _pro forma_ consolidated financial information and
underlying assumptions has been audited, reviewed or verified by an independent accounting firm or other third
party. The adjustments and assumptions used in preparing these metrics may prove to be inaccurate or may be
affected by other factors that have not been accounted for, including if any of the risks set out in these “Risk
_Factors” are magnified. As such, they should not be considered in isolation or be used as a substitute for an_
analysis of the operating results of our Group and no undue reliance should be made in respect of such
information.

42

Any failure to realize the anticipated pro forma adjustments to financial information could materially and
adversely affect our business, result of operations and financial condition.

###### Our success depends on effective project and site management, which could be impaired by a certain number of factors

For many of our projects, we provide a broad range of services with high technical complexities. For example,
in our Assemblin Electrical business area, we install complex electrical infrastructure in hospitals and other
commercial buildings and in our service business area, we provide maintenance and periodic repair of these
installations, for which a high level of technical skill is required. In order to ensure that the projects we take on
are effectively conducted and profitable, we need to have a high degree of project and site management
expertise, especially in evaluating the costs of providing our services to the relevant customer and in
maximizing efficiency in providing the contracted services throughout the term of the contract. In general,
accurate project planning and calculation of cost estimates for installation projects depend on certain key
factors, including the type of contract (for example performance contracts, where we are responsible for
installation activities according to the customers’ design, or “turn-key” contracts, where we are responsible for
both design and installation activities) and the type of pricing (e.g. fixed price, unit prices or prime cost principle
(cost plus overhead and profit)). For example, the risks associated with the calculation of a fixed price under a
“turn-key” contract are generally more significant in comparison to a performance contract with payment in
accordance with the cost-plus principle. Our fixed-price contracts are based largely on estimates and
assumptions of projected costs. The actual amount of time and costs involved in carrying out a project may
differ from estimates as these estimates depend on a wide range of parameters, some of which are difficult to
forecast at the beginning of a project.

Specific factors that can affect our performance and profitability include our ability to accurately determine the
costs of providing the contracted services in the context of a particular project, our ability to measure the
personnel and other resources that we need to deploy in order to fulfil our contractual obligations on an ongoing
basis, our ability to control services provided by subcontractors or to influence the performance of such
subcontractors or other service providers, and unforeseen technical difficulties that could cause project delays
or unscheduled project downtime. The challenges related to project management could be magnified by the
growth of our business, as we may be unable to staff each project with suitably qualified personnel. See “—Our
_success is highly dependent on the ability to recruit and retain technical and other key personnel.” Moreover,_
our ability to effectively manage our projects or deliver our services may be affected by factors beyond our
control, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, where we experienced delays in several installation projects due to
the closing of construction sites.

If, due to ineffective contract planning or management or otherwise, we are unable to efficiently and profitably
render our services, we could experience increased contract execution costs, difficulty in obtaining timely
payment for our services or harm to our reputation, which could materially adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

###### We bear the risk of cost overruns in many of our projects and, as a result, we may experience reduced profits or, in some cases, losses under these projects if the cost increases are above our estimated amounts

We base our prices for our fixed-price contracts largely upon estimates and assumptions of projected costs. The
timetable of execution and/or cost structure of our projects can differ from bid estimates because both depend
on a wide range of parameters, some of which are difficult to forecast at the beginning of a project, such as the
accessibility of the work site, the availability of qualified personnel, adverse weather conditions, supply chain
disruptions and increases in the prices of petroleum or raw materials used in the materials we purchase for
installation in our customers’ sites (for example, copper with respect to cables) which we may not be able to

43


-----

pass on through re-invoicing to our customers. If our estimates or assumptions prove to be inaccurate,
circumstances change in a way that renders our assumptions and estimates inaccurate, or if unexpected
complexities in project execution arise, we may incur costs higher than those that we estimated, cost overruns
may occur and we could experience reduced profits or a loss for affected projects. For example, in Finland, due
to poor project management and purchasing related problems, three branches experienced significant losses in
late 2022, impacting the business area’s profitability in the fourth quarter.

We also are exposed to increases in energy prices and prices for raw materials, especially in light of recent
rising and unpredictable inflation and due to geo-political tensions between Russia and other nations, that we
may be unable to pass on to our customers. Additionally, in certain circumstances, we guarantee project
completion or the achievement of certain acceptance and performance testing levels by a scheduled date, as
well as provide warranties to our customers for a certain period (generally five years) after project completion.
Although we seek to procure performance guarantees for our projects from insurance companies and banks for
up to 10 per cent. of the project’s value, a failure to meet schedule or performance requirements typically results
in additional costs to us, and, in some cases, it may create liability for consequential and liquidated damages.
In certain circumstances, some providers of performance guarantees may determine we are no longer qualified
to receive such guarantees, in which case, we would need to find alternative providers. Performance problems
for existing and future projects could cause our actual results of operations to differ materially from those we
anticipate and could damage our reputation within our industry and our customer base.

###### Our success is highly dependent on the ability to recruit and retain technical and other key personnel

Our future success depends on our ability to continue to identify, attract, train, retain and motivate a sufficient
number of highly skilled technical personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense. We may be unable to
successfully attract, assimilate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel. Failure to do so could harm our
business and growth, and ultimately our profitability. In particular, it may be difficult to find qualified personnel
in regions that are experiencing a growth in demand for the services that we provide, such as in Stockholm,
Oslo and Helsinki. In addition, our continued success depends largely on our ability to retain our technical and
key personnel. The departure of significant numbers of our highly skilled personnel could impair our ability to
execute our business plan and growth strategy, cause a loss of customers, reduce revenues and adversely affect
employee morale. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain or attract an adequately skilled labor
force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our business strategy or that labor expenses will not increase
as a result of a shortage in the supply of these skilled personnel.

In addition, our activities require a wide range of continually evolving skills in order to keep up with changes
in the sectors in which we operate. We may be unable to find qualified candidates, train staff in new methods,
and recruit and train managers.

Our operations may be impacted by pandemics and other public health incidents and we may incur significant
costs in maintaining employee health and safety requirements. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic,
we faced decreased access to qualified labor due government mandated lockdowns which led to closure of
borders and decreased labor mobility, incurred costs with maintaining appropriate health and safety measures
and experienced increased sick leave, which particularly affected our services business for which we rely on
the technical skills and institutional knowledge of our existing employees that cannot be readily replaced with
subcontractors. Additionally, as our operations expand, we may face increased work accidents and illness (both
in frequency and severity).

In addition, during periods of rapid economic growth, we may encounter problems in recruiting and retaining
qualified employees, as well as experience increased staff costs during these periods, or a decrease in the quality
of the services we provide, all of which could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

###### A majority of our balance sheet assets consist of intangible assets, which are subject to impairment testing and may affect future results of operations

Our intangible assets are substantial and represented SEK 5,870 million as of March 31, 2023. Our intangible
assets consist primarily of goodwill (SEK 5,715 million or 97.4 per cent. of our intangible assets).

We capitalize goodwill relating to acquisitions, which is calculated as the difference between the historical cost
and fair value of an acquired business and the fair value of our share of the acquired business’s identifiable net
assets at the time of acquisition. Goodwill from the acquisition of operations is recognized as an intangible
asset. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment testing at least annually. The identification and
measurement of impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units. Accounting for
impairment contains uncertainty because management must use judgment in determining appropriate
assumptions to be used in the measurement of fair value. The estimates of fair value of reporting units are based
on the best information available as of the date of the assessment and incorporate management assumptions
about expected future cash flows and contemplate other valuation techniques. For more information see our
financial statements included in this offering memorandum. An adverse development in our business activities
may require us to recognize impairment charges to write off all or a part of the carrying amount of our goodwill
and other intangible assets. If an expense or impairment loss must be recognized, it could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

There is significant judgement required in the analysis of a potential impairment of goodwill and other
intangible assets. The future development of the macroeconomic environment, pandemics, unsuccessful
acquisitions or other factors could lead to possibly significant impairments to be recognized in the future, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any of these developments could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or on our ability to service or otherwise
make payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness.

###### Our business, strategy implementation and internal control functions could be adversely affected if we fail to effectively maintain our decentralized organization and to attract and retain skilled managers, personnel and key executive officers and directors

Our ability to continue to implement our strategy (See “Business—Our Strategy”) successfully depends upon
the services of a small number of key executive officers and directors, including the Group management team.
There can be no assurance that these individuals will continue to make their services available to us in the
future. The loss of or diminution in the services of one or more of our key executive officers or directors, or our
inability to attract, retain and maintain new key executive officers or directors, could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Implementing our business strategy and maintaining our competitive position also largely depends on our
decentralized organizational structure in which branch managers retain substantial autonomy regarding the
management of the operations and customer accounts, and project managers are primarily responsible for the
carrying out of individual projects. We rely heavily on our branch managers for the success of a branch. Each
branch manager has the responsibility for recruiting and retaining a quality workforce and cultivating customer
loyalty. Each branch manager manages the operations of the branch, which includes recruiting, dispatching and
paying of employees, meeting the needs of our customers, maintaining customer satisfaction, selling our
services to new customers, as well as controlling costs through accident prevention, and complying with
applicable laws and regulations. Our future growth and financial performance depends on our ability to hire,
train and retain qualified managers from a limited pool of qualified candidates. We are dependent upon the
services of our employees and their respective local customer relationships, as well as on the skills and expertise
of our employees in particular projects or particular markets. We may not be able to retain such employees in

4


-----

the future, and such employees could leave us for competitors or form competing businesses themselves.
Despite our decentralized model, we also depend upon the services of our management. Any inability to attract
or retain an adequate number of qualified branch managers, project managers, key executive officers or other
skilled employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

###### Our decentralized operational structure exposes us to regulatory risks

Since our operations are decentralized, with approximately 199 local branches across the Nordics, our ability
to efficiently run and monitor our decentralized organization is particularly dependent on the skills and expertise
of our employees, particularly our branch managers and project managers. Furthermore, while we believe
decentralization is a key element of our business model and an important element for the implementation of our
strategy, decentralization necessarily places significant control and decision- making powers in the hands of
local project and branch managers. As a result, it may be more difficult to determine the sufficiency of existing
routines and procedures for internal governance and controls, including guidelines and policies, such as those
addressing anti-competition, anti-cartel, anti-bribery and money laundering rules and regulations. Furthermore,
there is a risk that local managers will not comply with our internal policies or processes or that we will not
successfully implement future compliance policies, update existing control procedures and compliance policies
and maintain efficient reliable IT systems required to effectively monitor our operations. Any breaches of the
foregoing risks and regulations, on a particular project or local branch level, could have an adverse effect on
our business, results of operations and financial condition.

###### Based on economic and other conditions impacting the markets in which our facilities are located, as well as the overall performance of individual branch locations, we may be required to close or dispose of under- performing branches

We may have to close under-performing branches from time to time as warranted by general economic
conditions and/or weakness in the local markets in which we operate. Furthermore, we engage in periodic
reviews of branch performance and may decide to close or dispose of branches based on under-performance,
poor cash flow and other considerations. Our under-performing branches may not be successful in generating
future profits. If we fail to identify branches that are under-performing in a timely manner or fail to take
appropriate remedial measures to support, close or dispose of an under-performing branch in a timely manner,
such failure may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

In addition, future branch closures could result in our reduced presence in certain of our local markets, which
could potentially have an adverse effect on our ability to provide our customers comprehensive services
throughout the Nordic region, which could adversely impact our reputation and results of operations. In
addition, branch closures may result in administrative and restructuring costs that could have a material adverse
impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

###### We may incur liabilities for the actions of our employees

Our employees deliver services within buildings and at locations owned or operated by our customers. As a
result, we may be subject to claims in connection with damage to property, business interruptions, unauthorized
use of the customer’s property or willful misconduct or other tortuous acts by our employees or people who
have gained unauthorized access to premises through our business operations. Such claims may be substantial
and may result in adverse publicity for our Group. Accordingly, these claims could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

46


-----

###### Damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects

Our reputation is important to our ability to market our services and secure new customers. Our historical
success is attributable, in large part, to our reputation as a leading and reliable provider of a broad range of
services, particularly services requiring a certain level of technical expertise, and this reputation has
strengthened our business and helped to facilitate our expansion. Although we closely monitor the quality of
our services, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to protect our business against damage to our reputation
vis-à-vis our customers, potential customers and, more generally, in the geographic regions and business sectors
in which we operate. Any damage to our reputation or brand as a result of adverse litigation, breach of
procurement laws or regulations, third-party challenges to contracts won in public procurement procedures,
failure to meet contract deadlines or specialized performance requirements, or for any other reason, could have
a material adverse effect on our marketing and ability to obtain projects from customers, as well as our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

###### A part of our net revenues is attributable to contracts awarded through tender processes, which can result in substantial costs and loss of revenue if we fail to compete effectively

A part of our net revenue generated from contractor assignments is attributable to contracts that are awarded
through tender processes, where price is often an important factor in determining which contractor to select,
especially with regard to projects in the public sector (such as municipalities, regional and governmental
authorities). For that reason, it is important for us to ensure that a prudent and realistic price is set in any tender
process, so that we do not overprice or underprice our services compared to our competitors. Some of our
competitors may be willing to offer a lower price than us, reduce staff costs, accept lower profit margins or
expend more in capital to obtain or retain customers. As a result, we may not be successful in winning awards
on commercially attractive terms over our competitors. In addition, competitive bidding results in substantial
costs and presents a number of risks, including substantial investments in terms of cost and time required to
prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may or may not be awarded to us, and the need to accurately
estimate the resources and costs that will be required to service any contract we are awarded, often already in
advance of the final determination of the full scope of the project. Our competitors may challenge projects
awarded to us in a competitive bidding process, which could result in the requirement to resubmit bids, the
termination, reduction or modification of the contracts awarded to us and an opportunity cost for other contracts
we might otherwise have pursued and won, all of which could have an adverse effect on our profitability and
results of operations. See “—We are party to public sector contracts, which may be affected by political and
_administrative decisions, and we are subject to risks inherent in public contracts”._

###### We are party to public sector contracts, which may be affected by political and administrative decisions, and we are subject to risks inherent in public contracts

Public sector customers account for a significant portion of our net revenue. The success and profitability of
our public sector business may be influenced by political considerations. It may also be affected by political
and administrative decisions concerning levels of public spending. In certain cases, due to applicable
regulations, such as European Union tender rules, certain terms of public sector contracts, such as pricing terms,
contract period, the use of subcontractors and the ability to transfer receivables under contract, could result in
less flexibility than comparable private sector contracts. Public sector contracts can, if entered into or prolonged
in violation of applicable tender rules, be declared invalid by a court of law, or if questioned by a third party
competitor, risk being terminated by the public sector customer. Certain of our public sector contracts may be
subject to challenge on these grounds and could be declared invalid if they are found to be in violation of
applicable public procurement law.

Moreover, decisions to decrease public spending may result in the termination, delay or downscaling of public
sector contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial

4


-----

condition. Historically, our performance has been linked, in part, to the ability and willingness of local, regional
and national governments to allocate public funds to infrastructure and other publicly funded projects, as well
as our ability to bid successfully for these contracts. Public sector spending, in turn, generally has been
dependent on long-term general macroeconomic conditions. A decrease in public sector spending as a result of
a deterioration in Nordic, European or global economic conditions, changes in governmental policy or other
reasons, including future pandemic outbreaks, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and
results of operations. There is a risk that a fall in public sector spending in the countries in which we operate
will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation.

Contracts in the public sector are also subject to review and monitoring by local authorities to ensure compliance
with laws and regulations prohibiting anti-competitive practices. Although we believe that we comply with
these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not be found in violation of any such laws or
regulations, and we could be subject to fines, penalties and other sanctions, including exclusion from
participation in tenders for public contracts. Any such event would have a material adverse effect on our
reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.

###### Changes in the laws and regulations governing public procurement could have a material impact on our business

As a government contractor, we are subject to a number of procurement regulations, requirements and
limitations relating to the conduct of business relationships and the formation of purchasing contracts, including
prohibitions on certain business practices that could be construed as bribery, public corruption or unfair
competitive practices. Although we maintain policies regarding compliance with these regulations, there can be
no assurance that our employees, subcontractors, agents and partners, or the public sector entities with whom
they contract, will not act in violation of such policies and/or applicable laws and regulations. See “—Our
_decentralized operational structure exposes us to regulatory risks”. Furthermore, if a public sector entity were_
to violate applicable procurement laws or regulations in connection with contracts entered into with us or our
marketing activities, the relevant authorities or a competitor could seek enforcement action against us. Any such
violation, even if prohibited by our policies, could result in civil or criminal penalties, the loss of business or
harm to our reputation and, accordingly, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or
financial condition.

In addition, awards under public procurement processes may be subject to challenge or rescission based on
actual or alleged procedural deficiencies in the tender process, even after we have made significant expenditures
associated with winning such an award. We (or a public sector customer) may face actions seeking to challenge
prior awards and we may not be successful in securing a contract in any re-tendering process, which could have
a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

###### We are exposed to risks related to business ethics and compliance

There is a risk that our group-wide policies addressing topics such as bribery, corruption and anticompetitive
practices, and related training activities, are not sufficient in order to ensure that our employees and suppliers
will comply with external statutory legal requirements, contractual obligations or our internal guidelines and
policies. As a consequence and through no direct action on our part, we may inadvertently become involved in
or associated with illegal or unethical activities such as cartelization, division of markets, price collusion or
bribery. If we are unable to identify and address such problems in a timely manner, or prevent legal, regulatory,
compliance or other violations by our employees, suppliers or agents, we could incur significant fines, civil and
criminal liability penalties and damage of reputation, which could have an adverse effect on our business and
results of operations.

Further, we are required to comply with various international, EU, national and local laws and regulations, for
example in relation to the environment and management of chemicals. Such laws and regulations are subject to

48


-----

continuous change and development. In order to remain compliant in the future, we may be required to make
additional expenditures or investments, which may be material. Failure to ensure compliance with applicable
laws and regulations may result in fines or enforcement actions which could have an adverse effect on our
business and results of operations.

###### Changes in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results of operations

The demand for our services is impacted by monetary and other government policies in each of the countries
in which we operate, including policies that have the effect of encouraging or discouraging construction, such
as long-term interest rates, tax policies, policies encouraging or discouraging labor mobility and migration, the
availability of financing or subsidies, the allocation of government funding for public infrastructure programs
and safety regulations that encourage or discourage the use of certain materials and products. Interest rate
changes, for example, affect demand for residential and non-residential structures, which in turn affects sales
of our services that serve these activities. Interest rate changes also affect our customers’ ability to finance
purchases and can impact the ability of our suppliers to finance the production of parts and components
necessary to deliver the services we sell. In addition to changing interest rates, central banks and other policy
arms of many countries take actions to vary the amount of liquidity and credit available to such country. For
example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, governments globally stepped up monetary and fiscal policies to
fight the economic effects of lockdowns and containment measures, lowering interest rates and undertaking
monetary stimulus on a large scale. Due to various factors, including rising inflation, such measures are now
being unwound and major central banks started raising interest rates in 2022. See “—Our business may be
_adversely affected by difficult economic conditions and other factors beyond our control.” Changes in liquidity_
and credit policies, including the reduction or elimination of favorable tax or other stimulus programs and
reversing of monetary policy measures, could adversely impact our customers, markets and suppliers, any of
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

###### Fluctuating commodity prices, including as a result of geographical conflict or macroeconomic factors, may adversely impact our results of operations

The prices of petroleum, copper, steel, aluminum and other commodities used in the products we install can be
volatile and our cost base is affected by energy costs. The global economy, and Europe in particular, is
witnessing a period of historical volatility in commodity prices, especially energy, due to a combination of
different factors, including high energy demand in the context of the economic recovery following the COVID19 pandemic and the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Significant fluctuations in the cost
of the commodities used in products we use as a part of the services that we deliver may adversely affect our
results of operations and financial condition.

We are not always able to quickly or effectively react to price increases by our suppliers or pass-through
increased costs to our customers. A majority of our contracts allow us to pass through cost increases to our
customers. However, short-term changes in the costs of raw materials, some of which are subject to significant
fluctuations, are not always passed on to our customers, and we do not currently enter into forward sales,
commodity, derivative or hedging arrangements to establish a price in advance for the purchase of future raw
materials. Therefore, rapid fluctuations in the cost of specific equipment or tools, or components included in
the products used by us may adversely affect our production costs. In addition, if prices decrease for
commodities, we may have inventories purchased at prices higher than prevailing market prices. Any delay in
our ability to, or inability to, pass on material price increases to our customers could adversely impact our
business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Prices and the availability of energy and fuel, which affect our business in part due to our car fleet of more than
3,000 service vehicles as of December 31, 2022, are subject to political, economic and market factors that are
outside our control. For example, we are currently operating in a period of geopolitical instability resulting from

49


-----

the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which has significantly contributed to increased
energy costs. While the length and impact of the ongoing war is unpredictable, the Russia-Ukraine conflict has
led and continues to lead to significant volatility in commodity and energy prices. As a consequence of the
Russia-Ukraine conflict, electricity and natural gas prices rose to unprecedented levels in 2022 and have
remained elevated, increasing our production costs. Any further significant increases in fuel or energy prices,
as a result of any of the aforementioned factors, or any increased costs relating to emissions control requirements
that have been or may be imposed in the future, including due to climate change-related legislation, could have
an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

###### Any failure of our third-party subcontractors or strategic partners to satisfactorily perform their obligations may hurt our reputation, business and results of operations.

We offer certain of our services to our customers through various third-party service providers engaged to
perform these services on our behalf. However, we retain responsibility for the work performed by these
subcontractors. Accordingly, we are exposed to risks relating to managing subcontractors and the risk that these
subcontractors may fail to perform the agreed-upon services satisfactorily and on a timely basis, which could
affect our ability to perform our obligations (which could lead to contractual monetary penalties) or meet our
customers’ expectations and comply with applicable regulatory requirements. In extreme cases, performance or
other deficiencies on the part of our subcontractors could result in a customer terminating our contract. A
termination could expose us to financial liabilities, damage our reputation and impair our ability to compete for
future contracts. In addition, in the event a subcontractor provides unsatisfactory services on our behalf, we
could be required to make additional investments or provide additional services to ensure the adequate
performance and delivery of the contracted services. In addition, we are exposed to the operational controls of
our subcontractors, including with respect to the qualifications of their personnel and their compliance with
labor and immigration laws. Our subcontractors may maintain inadequate insurance coverage or inadequate
financial resources to honor claims resulting from damages or losses inflicted by such subcontractors on our
customers.

We constantly manage and monitor the performance of our subcontractors. However, the failure of
subcontractors to meet their contractual obligations or comply with applicable laws or regulations could harm
our reputation, as well as result in customer losses and financial liabilities, any of which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Similarly, much of our business, particularly with respect to installation in new construction projects, derives
from our strategic partnerships with leading Scandinavian construction companies that hire us as
subcontractors.

In our contracts with these construction companies, we often agree, along with all other subcontractors on the
project, to have joint and several liability for the performance of the construction company’s obligations under
the supply contract. To the extent one of our strategic partners encounters financial difficulties or otherwise
becomes unable to perform its obligations under the construction contract, we may incur substantial liabilities,
which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

###### We rely on third-party suppliers, and if we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers, or if there is a significant interruption in our supply chains or significant fluctuation in the prices of our product supply, our results of operations could be adversely affected

Our ability to offer a wide variety of services to our customers is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate
product supply from manufacturers or other suppliers at attractive prices. For the year ended December 31,
2022, we estimate that our top ten suppliers accounted for 37 per cent. of our total supply costs. We may not be
able to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers that can satisfy our standards for quality and

0


-----

price and our need to access products and supplies in a timely and efficient manner. We may be required to
replace a supplier if its products do not meet our quality, price or safety standards. Our results of operations and
inventory levels could suffer if we are unable to promptly replace a supplier that is unwilling or unable to satisfy
our requirements with a supplier providing similar products. The loss of, or substantial decrease in the
availability of, products from our suppliers, or the loss of a key supplier, could adversely impact our business,
results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

In addition, supply interruptions could arise from shortages of raw materials, labor disputes or weather
conditions affecting products or shipments, transportation disruptions, geopolitical disturbances, including the
ongoing Russo-Ukrainian conflict, or other factors beyond our control, including closures related to any future
pandemics. Short-term and long-term disruptions in our supply chain would result in a need to maintain higher
inventory levels as we replace similar products, a higher cost of goods and ultimately a decrease in our net
revenue and profitability. A disruption in the timely availability of our goods by our key suppliers and the failure
by our suppliers to continue to supply us with products on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, may result
in a decline of our operating margins and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,
financial condition and cash flow.

The cost of our services historically have been volatile and subject to fluctuations arising from changes in supply
and demand, economic conditions, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulation and
trade policies, as well as from periodic delays in the delivery of our products. We have a limited ability to
control the timing and amount of changes to prices that we will pay for our products. In addition, the supply of
our products fluctuates based on available manufacturing capacity. A shortage of capacity, or excess capacity,
in the industry can result in significant increases or decreases in market prices for those products, often within
a short period of time. Even where we are able to increase our prices to our customers, we may be unable to
increase our prices in sufficient time to absorb price increases by our suppliers. Such price fluctuations can
adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

###### We are dependent on our relationships with strategic partners in the building and services industry, including NCC, Skanska and PEAB, the three largest construction companies in the Nordic region based on revenue. The failure to maintain these relationships could result in the loss of business and, as a result, materially adverse effects on our operating performance

Our business, particularly with respect to installation in new construction projects, is dependent in large part on
our long-standing relationships with leading Nordic construction companies. For example, we were part of an
installation group that was hired by building contractor Skanska to conduct the planning and design of the
installation work for the new health care building in the Malmö hospital area in 2015. In September 2019,
Skanska entrusted the same installation group with the implementation phase of that project, an assignment that
is worth approximately SEK 1,669 million in total and of which we will be responsible for SEK 1,067 million.

Our opportunities to partner with these types of construction companies could be adversely affected if: we are
unable to achieve the objectives under our arrangements in a timely manner, or at all; our partners become
unable, unwilling or less willing to invest in new property development due to poor general market conditions,
their financial condition or other circumstances, many of which are beyond our control; we disagree with a key
partner regarding strategic direction, the economics of our relationship or other matters; we are unable to
successfully manage multiple simultaneous projects with such partners; our strategic partners breach or
terminate their contract with us; our partners become competitors of ours or enter into agreements with our
competitors; applicable laws and regulations, domestic or foreign, impede our ability to enter into strategic
arrangements; or as we enter into additional or consolidation in the construction markets limits the number of
potential industry partners. If any of these events occur, or if we fail to maintain our agreements with our
strategic partners and collaborators, we may not be able to further develop our business or generate sufficient
revenues to support our operations. Additionally, our business could be negatively impacted if any of our

1


-----

industry partners undergo a change of control, assign the rights or obligations under any of our agreements or
cease to be a going concern. We may be exposed to the credit risk of certain of our customers and, in addition,
our liability to customers under guarantee provisions may materially and adversely affect our earnings.

We sell installation and services solutions to our customers through contracts that are not secured by collateral
or other security and therefore bear the risk that our customers will be unable to pay amounts due to us. Our
products are sold to customers in industries that may experience fluctuations in demand based on economic
conditions, energy prices, seasonality, consumer demand and other factors beyond our control. These industries
include the construction industry. We may not be able to limit our potential loss of revenues if a significant
number of customers are unable to pay amounts due to us on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

At the same time, we generally provide guarantees for completed projects as to the proper operation and
conformance to specifications of our installations and services. The failure of our installations to operate
properly or to meet specifications may increase our costs by requiring additional engineering resources and
services, the replacement of parts and equipment or monetary reimbursement to a customer. We have in the past
received guarantee claims, are subject to guarantee claims and we expect to continue to receive them in the
future. To the extent that we incur substantial guarantee claims in any period, our reputation, our ability to
obtain future business and our earnings could be adversely affected.

###### Our competitive position could be adversely affected by changes in technology and industry standards

Our business requires a high level of technical expertise for a wide variety of services. We need to constantly
adapt our expertise in response to technological innovations, as well as industry standards, product instructions
and customer requirements. New technology or changes in industry and customer requirements may render
some of our services obsolete, excessively costly or otherwise unmarketable.

As a result, we must continuously enhance our expertise and the efficiency and reliability of our services in
order to remain at the forefront of industry standards and customer requirements. If we are unable to adapt to
ever-changing technologies and customer requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner, our competitive
position will suffer and our prospects for growth will be impaired, which would adversely affect our business
and results of operations.

###### A change in supplier rebates due to the loss of our leading market position or other market conditions or a deterioration in our commercial relationship with one or more key suppliers could adversely affect our income and gross margins

The terms on which we purchase products from many of our suppliers enable us to receive a rebate based on
the volume of our purchases. These rebates effectively reduce our costs. Our ability to earn and negotiate rebates
is critical to the success of our business. If market conditions change or if we lose our leading market position,
suppliers may respond by changing the terms of some or all of these purchasing programs to our detriment. Any
such changes could lower our gross margins or revenues. Furthermore, a loss of market share could result in a
decreased demand for our services, which could cause our volume requirements for certain products to decline.
If we are unable to meet specified volume thresholds for certain suppliers, we may not receive favorable rebates,
which could increase our costs and decrease our gross margins.

In addition, some of our suppliers are not obligated under long-term supply agreements to continue to sell to
us. We have relatively few sources of supply for some of the products that we purchase, and in some cases we
rely on a small group of suppliers for certain key products. In addition, the lead time involved in the
manufacturing of some of these components can be lengthy. If certain of our key suppliers become unwilling
or unable to supply us with components meeting our requirements, we may not be able to organize additional

2


-----

or replacement suppliers in a timely manner, or at all. Moreover, we maintain low levels of inventory and our
suppliers deliver directly to our work sites, which prevents us from being able to provide replacement supplies
on our own should one or more or our suppliers fail to meet our supply requirements. The inability or
unwillingness of our suppliers to provide timely delivery of products necessary for our installations and services
projects could cause our services to be disrupted and our results of operations to decline.

###### Our business model could be negatively affected by changing industry standards regarding the treatment of annual volume rebates in cost-plus contracts

We benefit from annual volume rebates in our contractual arrangements for raw materials with our suppliers
due to our size within the Swedish construction industry, which provides us with the ability to source materials
at a cost-effective price. Furthermore, in contracts that we enter into with our customers, which are priced on a
cost-plus basis, annual volume rebates are excluded for the purposes of said cost-plus pricing. This exclusion
allows us to maintain a competitive edge by leveraging our overall purchasing power, which results in reduced
costs, except for the purpose of pricing cost-plus contracts, resulting in favorable margins in our cost-plus
contracts.

If there are changes in industry practices, regulatory requirements, or customer demands that mandate the
inclusion of annual volume rebates in cost-plus contracts, our current advantage may be eroded as our margins
would be reduced, impairing our pricing competitiveness and profitability. Additionally, the inclusion of annual
volume rebates in the future could require us to revisit our pricing models, renegotiate contracts or develop
alternative strategies to maintain our market position. Failure to adapt to such changes effectively could result
in us being unable to price our cost-plus contracts competitively and profitably, loss of market share and adverse
effects on financial performance. Such changes in industry standards may adversely affect our business, results
of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

###### Our operations could be adversely affected if a significant number of our customers terminate their services contracts prior to the end of the contractual term or select another provider following the expiration of their contracts

We perform some of our service work for customers under contracts with a stated term and, in some cases, with
termination clauses permitting the customer to cancel the contract at the customer’s discretion following the
expiration of an agreed notice period. There can be no assurance that our customers will not exercise their rights
to terminate their contracts prior to expiration or that we will be successful in negotiating new contracts with
customers as such contracts expire. We generally execute our business through numerous small contracts
(including multiple contracts for the same customers) and, therefore, any cancellation of a contract or a number
of contracts would not ordinarily have an adverse effect on our results of operations. However, contract
cancellations or dissatisfaction with our services may damage our reputation and make it more difficult for us
to obtain similar contracts with other customers, in which case our business and results of operations would be
adversely affected.

###### Amounts included in our estimated order backlog may not result in actual revenue or translate into profits, and our estimated order backlog is subject to delays, customer bankruptcy, accounting errors and unexpected adjustments and is therefore an uncertain indicator of future results of operations

As of March 31, 2023, our order backlog was SEK 9,115 million, which represented 64.7 per cent. of our net
revenue for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023. Although our backlog only includes expected sales under
committed contracts with customers, there can be no assurance that these contractual terms would not change,
and that the backlog will result in an actual recognition of revenue within the period initially anticipated, if at
all. In addition, certain contracts included in our estimated order backlog may not be profitable. We may
experience variances in the realization of our estimated order backlog because of project delays or cancellations

3


-----

resulting from weather conditions, project deferrals or delays, scope adjustments, external market factors and
economic factors beyond our control. If our estimated order backlog fails to materialize as we anticipated, our
business, financial condition or results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. Accordingly,
our estimated order backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of future revenue or earnings.

Our order backlog does not provide a precise indication of the time period over which we are contractually
entitled to receive such revenue and there is no assurance that such revenues will be actually received by us in
the time frames anticipated, or at all. Our order backlog is computed based on facts known and assumptions
deemed appropriate at the computation date. Although under our unilateral termination rights relating to defined
termination events, our order backlog is based on the full contractual period, as we estimate that, based on our
operating history and course of dealing with our customers, these contracts are more likely than not to reach
their full term and be continued for the duration of their option periods.

Unforeseen events or circumstances, including, for example, the termination or scaling down of service
contracts, may affect the backlog and could negatively impact our earnings and financial position. There can be
no assurance that the revenue projected in our order backlog will be realized or, if realized, that it will result in
profits. Because of contract terminations or suspensions and changes in contract scope and schedule, we cannot
predict with certainty when, or if, our order backlog will be achieved. We can provide no assurance that we will
not receive additional terminations, and, even where a contract proceeds as scheduled, it is possible that the
customer may default and fail to pay amounts owed by it. To the extent we are unable to realize the pipeline of
revenue associated with contracts in our backlog due to material delays, terminations or payment defaults, our
business, financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected. See “—Our business may be
_adversely affected by difficult economic conditions and other factors beyond our control” and “Management’s_
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Results_
_of Operations— Seasonality.” Finally, our definition of backlog may not necessarily be the same as that used_
by other companies engaged in activities similar to us. As a result, the amount of backlog reported by us may
not be comparable to the backlog reported by such other companies.

###### We may incur liabilities that are not covered by insurance

We maintain insurance policies to protect our core businesses against loss or potential liability arising from
contracting parties and third party claims. Risks that generally are insured include claims that naturally may
occur in our business operations, for example, damage on our property, business interruption, damage on third
parties’ property or public and production liability. Additionally, we obtain insurance coverage for certain
specific larger projects. Nevertheless, not all claims are insurable and there can be no assurance that we will not
experience major incidents that are not covered by our insurance. Furthermore, the occurrence of several events
resulting in substantial claims for damages within a calendar year may have a material adverse effect on our
business. In addition, our insurance costs may increase over time in response to any negative development in
our claims history or due to material price increases in the insurance market in general. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to maintain our current insurance coverage or do so at a reasonable cost.

###### We are exposed to warranty claims following project completion during warranty periods

We are exposed to warranty claims that may arise following project completion during warranty periods. Under
the standard general conditions used in the industry (in Sweden, AB 04, ABT 06 and AB-U/ABT-U 07, in
Norway, NS 8405/8407/8415/8417, and in Finland, YSE 1998), warranty liability subsists for a period of ten
years from approval of the total works. Our warranties will be covered under the Guarantee Facility, which
typically covers approximately 5 per cent. of the value of each project. The liability period begins with a
warranty period, which, unless otherwise agreed, is five years for workmanship, two years (according to AB
04) or five years (according to ABT 06) for materials and goods and two years for special materials and goods
(according to ABT 06). If we receive a longer warranty period for materials or goods, this longer warranty

4


-----

period also applies between us and the customer. Under the standard general conditions, we are liable for defects
which appear during the warranty period. In case of defects appearing after the warranty period, but before the
end of the period of liability, we will have continued liability if the defect is substantial and was caused by
negligence. The liability for defects primarily includes an obligation to rectify the defect without delay and at
our cost. Under the standard forms of contracts, we are liable to indemnify the customer for damage caused by
a defect. Our liability for damages also comprises measures taken or omitted by our employees as well as by
our contractors, suppliers and other persons engaged by us. Claims against us during the warranty period occur
in the ordinary course of our business and as of March 31, 2023, warranty provisions amounted to SEK 116
million. See “—We are involved in disputes from time to time, the outcome of which may be uncertain, and
_insurances or provisions made may be insufficient to cover our losses and other liabilities resulting from such_
_disputes.”_

###### We are involved in disputes from time to time, the outcome of which may be uncertain, and insurances or provisions made may be insufficient to cover our losses and other liabilities resulting from such disputes

We are involved in disputes from time to time. Such legal proceedings typically include claims by customers
or other third parties, related to work conducted by us or our subcontractors, disputes related to delays or
payment or employment disputes. In particular, we may encounter difficulties in meeting contractual
performance obligations, which may result in the incurrence of penalties for non-performance or due to a delay
by us in the performance of our contractual obligations. In addition, we rely on third-party partners, equipment
manufacturers and subcontractors to complete some of our contracts. As such, claims involving customers,
suppliers and subcontractors may be brought against us, and by us, in connection with our contracts. Claims
brought against us could include back charges for alleged defective or incomplete work, breaches of warranty
and/or late completion of a project and claims for cancelled projects. The claims and back charges can involve
actual damages, as well as contractually agreed-upon liquidated sums. These claims, as well as claims that we
bring against customers or other third parties, if not resolved through negotiation, could result in lengthy and
expensive litigation or arbitration proceedings.

We occasionally bring claims against project owners for additional costs that exceed the contract price or for
amounts not included in the original contract price, including change orders. These types of claims occur due
to matters such as owner-caused delays, increased unit prices or changes from the initial project scope that
result, both directly and indirectly, in additional costs. Occasionally, these claims can be the subject of lengthy
arbitration, litigation or third-party expert proceedings, and it can be difficult to accurately predict when these
claims will be fully resolved. When these types of events occur and unresolved claims are pending, we may
invest significant working capital in projects to cover cost overruns pending the resolution of the relevant
claims.

When we determine that a significant risk of a future claim exists against it, we record provisions in an amount
equal to its estimated liability, as provisions for restructuring, onerous contracts and disputes amounted to SEK
21 million as of March 31, 2023. Our insurance or provisions may not cover all claims that may be asserted
against us, and any claims asserted against us, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm our
reputation. There is a risk that we will not be successful in defending ourselves in pending or future litigation
claims or similar matters, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

###### We are party to public sector contracts and is thus subject to risks inherent in public contracts

A portion of our local customers are public institutions and these accounted for a significant portion of our net
revenue for the financial year ended December 31, 2022. Public institutions contract with us through public
procurement processes with strict specifications. Our work for public institutions includes both project and
service assignments. Examples of customers within this customer group include pension funds, county councils


-----

(for example Region Östergötland), municipalities, Akademiska Hus and Swedish Defence Materiel
Administration (Sw. Försvarets materielverk) (“FMV”). The future prospects and profitability of our public
sector business may be affected by political and administrative decisions concerning levels of public spending,
which may be impacted by monetary and fiscal policy, as well as general economic conditions. See “—Our
_business may be adversely affected by difficult economic conditions and other factors beyond our control” and_
“—Changes in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results of operations.” In
certain cases, due to applicable regulations, such as public tendering rules in the EU, certain terms of public
sector contracts, such as pricing terms, contract period, the use of subcontractors and the ability to transfer
receivables under a contract, could result in less flexibility than comparable private sector contracts. Public
sector contracts can, if entered into or prolonged in violation of applicable tender rules, also be declared invalid
by a court of law, or if challenged by a third-party competitor, be terminated by the public sector customer.
Certain of our public sector contracts may be subject to challenge on these grounds and could be declared
invalid if they are found to be in violation of applicable public procurement law. In addition, awards under
public procurement processes may be subject to challenge or rescission based on actual or alleged procedural
deficiencies in the tender process, even after we have made significant expenditures associated with winning
such an award. We (or a public sector customer) may face actions seeking to challenge prior awards and we
may not be successful in securing a contract in any re-tendering process, which could have an adverse effect on
our business and net revenue.

Contracts in the public sector are also subject to review and monitoring by local authorities to ensure compliance
with laws and regulations prohibiting anti-competitive practices. If we are found to be in violation of any such
laws or regulations, we could be subject to fines, penalties and other sanctions, including exclusion from
participation in tenders for public contracts. Any such event would have an adverse effect on our reputation,
business and results of operations.

###### If we fail to ensure safe work environments for our employees, we could be exposed to significant financial losses, as well as civil and criminal liabilities

Our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to the maintenance of safe conditions in
the workplace. The industry in which we operate involves a certain degree of operational risk, such as working
with high voltages, heat and at heights, which cannot be fully eliminated by procedures implemented to address
them. These hazards can cause personal injury or death, severe damage to or destruction of property and
equipment and other consequential damages and could lead to the suspension of operations and large damage
claims and, in extreme cases, criminal liability.

If we were to fail to implement any safety or other procedures with respect to our sites, or if the procedures we
implement were deemed to be ineffective, our employees or others may suffer injury and we could incur
significant financial losses. In addition, we could be found liable for failing to comply with government
regulation dealing with occupational health and safety. Occurrence of any of these events could cause a
materially adverse effect on our operations and profitability. Our failure, or the failure of one of our
subcontractors, to comply with applicable regulations or to maintain a safe work environment could result in
substantial fines, claims relating to violations of social and working environment legislation or the revocation
of licenses. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to claims relating to employees’ working
conditions. Any such claims, or increased costs resulting from such claims or regulatory changes, could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Additionally, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, our worksites and offices had to implement and maintain
measures designed to stop the spread of the virus, including sanitation, social distancing and mask wearing. If
there is another pandemic outbreak in the future, we may need to implement similar policies again.

6


-----

New technology and the implementation of new work processes, services, tools and machinery may also have
unforeseen effects on the working conditions of our employees. In addition, our employees may be exposed to
materials that, although not currently considered harmful, could in the future be deemed health hazards, as was
the case with asbestos. Unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase project costs for our customers and
raise our operating costs. Any of the foregoing could result in financial losses, which could have a material
adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

###### Failure to comply with transfer pricing regulations may result in the payment of additional tax or penalties by us

The markets in which we operate have transfer pricing regulations that require transactions involving associated
companies to be at arm’s length. Arrangements between members of our Group, such as intra-Group
transactions involving management services, royalties, IT service fees, cash-pool arrangements, intra- Group
loans and consultancy fees, are typically carried out on an arm’s-length basis. However, if the tax authorities in
any relevant jurisdiction do not regard such arrangements as being made on an arm’s-length basis and
successfully challenge those arrangements, the amount of tax payable by the relevant member or members of
our Group, in respect of both current and previous years, may increase materially and penalties or interest may
be payable. Furthermore, any failure to file transfer pricing documentation evidencing the outcome of applied
pricing principles, should they be requested by the relevant tax authorities, may result in penalties.

###### We are exposed to risks in connection with derivative instruments and hedging transactions.

We use derivative financial instruments (primarily currency and interest rate swaps and interest rate ceilings)
to help limit and control foreign exchange and interest rate risks. Such transactions involve risks, particularly,
if the interest or exchange rate development differs from expectations. The projections and assumptions made
by our risk management team at the time when such transactions were entered into could prove to be incorrect
and the transactions could fail to limit the risks as intended or increase our costs. This could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we intend to hedge
some or all of our interest rate and currency risk under the Notes since the majority of our revenues are paid in
currency other than euros, which is the currency of the Notes. Such hedges are senior obligations of the Issuer
and rank pari passu in right of payment with the Notes and obligations under the Super Senior Facilities, and
together with the Notes, the Super Senior Facilities are secured by first-priority security interests over the
Collateral; provided, however, that, under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, certain hedges are “super
senior” in terms of the receipt of the proceeds of enforcement of Collateral until such super senior hedges and
obligations under the Super Senior Facilities have been repaid in full. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements— Intercreditor Agreement.” If we were to default in making payments under the Notes, or if_
certain other credit events were to occur in relation to us and a credit-linked hedge of interest rate or currency
risk in respect of such Notes were to terminate or be closed out as a result, then, in relation to the mark-tomarket (“MTM”) value which would normally be payable by one party to the other on a termination or closeout of an equivalent hedge that was not credit-linked, either (a) we will be limited, where such MTM value
would otherwise be payable to us, in claiming against our hedge counterparty in respect of such termination or
close-out to an amount equal to the product of (i) such MTM value and (ii) the credit recovery rate for holders
of the Notes, such credit recovery rate being determined within a reasonable period after such termination or
close-out by reference to a market auction process or market quotations for such notes, or (b) no MTM payment
in respect of such termination or close-out will be due from either party, depending on the particular type of
credit-linked hedge into which we enter.

###### We are exposed to translation risk of currency fluctuations

Our business operations are characterized by a relatively low level of transactional currency risk since our
purchases and sales are made in the same local currency with minimal exposure to imported components. From
an accounting perspective, we are exposed to risks relating to translation into Swedish kronor of income


-----

statements and balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries with local reporting denominated in euro (in the case of
operations in Finland) and Norwegian kroner. In order to prepare our consolidated financial statements, we
must translate foreign currency assets, liabilities, net revenue and expenses into Swedish kronor. For balance
sheet items, foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates applicable on
the transaction date. For income statement items, foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency
at the average exchange rate applicable to the period. Consequently, increases and decreases in the value of the
Swedish krona against other currencies affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements,
even if their value has not changed in their original currency. A 5 per cent. strengthening of the euro as of
December 31, 2022 would have had a negative translation effect on equity of SEK 4 million and the same
increase in value of the Norwegian krone would have had a positive translation effect on equity of SEK 18
million.

###### The residential, non-residential and infrastructure construction markets are seasonal and our business operations may be affected by adverse weather conditions

We experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for certain of our services, due primarily to weather and
holiday seasons. Although weather patterns affect our results of operations throughout the year, cold and wet
weather during the winter months has historically reduced construction activity primarily in the first quarter in
our markets. In contrast, our highest volume of net revenue historically has occurred in September through
November. Generally, during the winter months, new construction activity declines due to inclement weather
and to the holiday season. Public holidays and vacation, particularly in the months of June and July, also have
seasonality effects, because building projects or industrial production processes may slow or temporarily cease.
As a result, our results of operations may vary significantly from period to period. We anticipate that fluctuations
from period to period will continue in the future.

In addition, cold weather is less favorable for construction projects and delays installation work because it
hinders site accessibility. Adverse weather conditions, particularly during the winter season, could affect the
ability of our employees to perform efficient work outdoors in certain regions of Sweden, Finland, and Norway.
We may experience reduced cash flow if unseasonal weather conditions persist, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

###### Changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax position could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

We are subject to complex tax laws in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes in tax laws could
adversely affect our tax position, including our effective tax rate or tax payments. In addition, Swedish, Finnish,
Norwegian and European and other international tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and are
subject to varying interpretations. We often rely on generally available interpretations of tax laws and
regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We cannot be certain that the relevant tax authorities are in
agreement with our interpretation of these laws. If our tax positions are challenged by relevant tax authorities,
the imposition of additional taxes could require us to pay taxes that we currently do not collect or pay or increase
the costs of our services to track and collect such taxes, which could increase our costs of operations and have
a negative effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

###### We occupy most of our facilities under short- and medium-term leases. We may be unable to renew leases at the end of their terms. If we close a facility, we remain obligated under the applicable lease

Most of our facilities are located in leased premises. Most of our leases are non-cancellable and short- or
medium-term. We believe that leases we enter into in the future will likely be on similar terms as our current
leases. We may be unable to renew our leases at the end of their terms, or the terms of such renewal may be less
favorable to us than those under the current leases. If we close a facility, we generally remain committed to
perform our obligations under the applicable lease, which includes the payment of the base rent for the balance

8


-----

of the lease term. Over the course of the last few years, we closed a number of facilities for which we remain
liable on the lease obligations. Our obligation to continue making rent payments in respect of leases for closed
facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

###### We may be required to make further contributions to our pension schemes if the value of pension fund assets is not sufficient to cover potential obligations

Some of our white-collar employees in Sweden are covered by a defined benefit pension plan, which is
accounted for in accordance with IAS 19 under which we are required to provide agreed benefits to current and
former employees. Other employees have pensions that are recognized as defined-contribution.

As of December 31, 2022, approximately 29 per cent. of our employees had defined benefit pensions. Of these,
the Swedish plan for electricity white-collar employees is unfunded and based on final salary, which provides
employees with benefits in the form of a guaranteed level of pension disbursements over their lifetimes and is
recognized as defined benefit for purposes of our financial statements. For the remaining white-collar
employees in Sweden the defined-benefit pension obligations are secured through insurance with Alecta and
are accounted for as a defined contribution plan.

Pension scheme liabilities vary with changes to long-term interest rates, inflation, pensionable salaries and the
longevity of scheme members. Our liabilities in respect of provisions for pensions increased from SEK 746
million as of December 31, 2020, to SEK 788 million as of December 31, 2021, before decreasing to SEK 548
million as of December 31, 2022 and rebounding slightly to SEK 596 million as of March 31, 2023, driven
primarily by an increase in market interest rates, which resulted in the assumed discount rate for defined- benefit
obligations increasing from 1.10 per cent. as of December 31, 2020 to 4.00 per cent. on December 31, 2022 and
March 31, 2023. The increase in liabilities in respect of provisions for pensions also reflects the relatively
greater proportion of plan participants that are not eligible for retirement, as compared to the number of former
plan participants that have retired. Changes to local legislation and regulations relating to defined benefit plan
funding requirements may also result in significant deviations in the timing and size of the expected cash
contributions under such plans. For example, in the year ended December 31, 2022, actuarial losses and
financial commitments related to pensions liability amounted to SEK 207 million. Increases in our pensions
liability could adversely affect our financial condition.

In accordance with the requirements of the pension administrator, we are required to provide bank guarantees
in respect of a portion of the Group’s defined-benefit pensions obligations. We have been required to increase
the amount of our current SEK 375 million bank guarantee, of which SEK 285 million is incurred under the
Pension Guarantee Facility and SEK 90 million is incurred under the Guarantee Facility. Our obligations with
respect to (i) the Pension Guarantee Facility are secured on the Collateral on a super senior basis to the Notes
and (ii) the Guarantee Facility are secured on the Collateral on a super senior basis to the Notes. See
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—The Super Senior Facilities.” Availability of the additional
guarantee amounts under the Pension Guarantee Facility or the Guarantee Facility, however, is subject to certain
conditions, including compliance with certain financial covenants. Moreover, lenders under the Pension
Guarantee Facility may not be able to increase the size of their commitments thereunder in time to satisfy the
deadline set by the pension administrator or at all. If the Swedish pensions regulatory authority requires us to
provide bank guarantees of our pensions liabilities or increase the size of our pre-existing bank guarantees in
excess of the amounts that are available to us, this may result in additional financial obligations being imposed
on us by the regulator, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

###### Work stoppages or strikes could adversely affect our business

We are required to comply with local labor law requirements (including in respect of minimum salary levels as
well as employee conditions) in the jurisdictions where our employees perform their work. Changes with regard
to labor laws in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could restrict our ability to utilize employees away

9


-----

from their home jurisdiction, result in increased labor costs, including increases due to healthcare reforms or
minimum wage increase, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation
and financial condition.

Many of our employees are members of unions, and most of our employees who work in our warehouses are
covered by collective bargaining agreements. We may encounter strikes or other disturbances, or threats of
strikes or disturbances occasioned by our unionized labor force and, upon the expiration of existing collective
bargaining agreements, we may be unable to reach new collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms
or without work stoppages, strikes or similar industrial actions. Our inability to negotiate satisfactory terms for
new agreements would likely cause our labor costs to increase, which would negatively affect our profit margins
if we are unable to pass the additional costs on to our customers.

When we acquire companies and integrate them into our existing operations, we occasionally enter into
negotiations to restructure or reduce the workforce at the acquired company. We may experience lengthier
consultations or even strikes, work stoppages or other industrial actions in the future, particularly when we are
engaged in restructuring and reducing our workforce. Any industrial action or threat thereof could disrupt our
operations, possibly for a significant period of time, and result in increased wages and benefits or otherwise
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

###### Risks Related to Our Structure

 The Note Guarantees and security interests on the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability 

The Indenture will provide that certain Note Guarantees will be limited to the maximum amount that can be
guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor without rendering the relevant Note Guarantee voidable or otherwise
ineffective under applicable law and enforcement of each Note Guarantee would be subject to certain generally
available defenses. These laws and defenses include those that relate to corporate benefit, fraudulent transfer or
conveyance, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws,
regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. Additionally, in accordance with local laws,
the Security Agent and/or the Trustee may not be able to represent the holders of the Notes in a court process
without a specific power of attorney. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees
_and the Security Interests.”_

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance and other laws, a
court could subordinate or void the Note Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral granted by the
relevant Security Documents and, if payment had already been made under a Note Guarantee or upon
enforcement of the Collateral, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant Guarantor, if the court
found that:

- the relevant Note Guarantee or security interest under the Security Documents was incurred with actual
intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or security provider or, in
certain jurisdictions, even when the recipient was simply aware that the Guarantor or security provider was
insolvent when it granted the relevant Note Guarantee or security;

- the Guarantor or security provider did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for the
relevant Note Guarantee or security interest under a Security Document and the Guarantor or security
provider was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Note Guarantee or security interest;
(ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Note Guarantee or security

60


-----

interest; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at
maturity;

- the relevant Note Guarantees or Security Documents were held to exceed the corporate objective of the
Guarantor or security provider or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor
or security provider; or

- the amount paid or payable under the relevant Note Guarantee or the enforcement proceeds under the
relevant Security Documents was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon applicable governing
law. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness:

- the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, is greater than the fair value of all its assets;

- the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay the probable liability on
its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become due; or

- it cannot pay its debts as they become due.

If a court were to find that the issuance of the Notes or a Note Guarantee was a fraudulent conveyance or held
it unenforceable for any other reason, the court could hold that the payment obligations under the Notes or such
Guarantee are ineffective, or require the holders of the Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the
Notes or such Note Guarantee. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent conveyance occurred, you may cease
to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if
applicable, of the other Guarantors under any Note Guarantees that have not been declared void.

Additionally, any future pledge of Collateral in favor of the Security Agent, including pursuant to Security
Documents delivered after the date of the Indenture, might be avoidable by the security provider (as debtor-inpossession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy (or similar officer) if certain events or circumstances exist or occur,
including, among others, if the security provider is insolvent at the time of the pledge, the pledge permits the
holders of the Notes to receive a greater recovery than if the pledge had not been given and a bankruptcy
proceeding in respect of the security provider is commenced within three months following the pledge, or in
certain circumstances, a longer period.

In order to receive the benefit of a security interest, the secured creditors must hold secured claims (i.e., the
secured party and the creditor have to be the same person).

In addition, under the terms of the Indenture, we will be permitted in the future to incur additional indebtedness
and other obligations that may share in the liens on the Collateral securing the Notes and the liens on the
collateral securing our other secured debt. The granting of new security interests may require the releasing and
retaking of security or otherwise create new hardening periods in certain jurisdictions. The applicable hardening
period for these new security interests will run from the moment each new security interest has been granted or
perfected. At each time, if the security interest granted or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the
respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective and it may
not be possible to enforce it.

###### The insolvency laws of Sweden, Norway and Finland may not be as favorable to you as U.S. bankruptcy laws and may preclude holders of the Notes from recovering payments due on the Notes

The Issuer is established under the laws of Sweden, and certain of the Guarantors are established under the laws
of Sweden, Norway and Finland. Consequently, in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency of the Issuer or any
of the Guarantors, insolvency proceedings with respect to the Issuer or the Guarantors would most likely be
based on and governed by the insolvency laws of the jurisdiction under which the relevant entity is established.

61


-----

The insolvency laws of Sweden, Norway and Finland may be less favorable to your interests as creditors than
the bankruptcy laws of the United States or another jurisdiction with which you may be familiar, particularly
with respect to the priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the
insolvency proceedings. The application of these laws, and any conflict between them, may limit your ability
to recover payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency
laws. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests.”

###### Enforcing your rights as a holder of Notes or under the Note Guarantees or security across multiple jurisdictions may prove difficult

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Sweden and the Guarantors are incorporated or organized under
the laws of Sweden, Norway and Finland. The Collateral includes the shares of certain of our subsidiaries
incorporated under the laws of these jurisdictions. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event,
proceedings could be initiated in Sweden, Norway and Finland. Such multijurisdictional proceedings are likely
to be complex and costly for creditors and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the
enforcement of your rights. Your rights under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject
to the insolvency and administrative laws of several jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that you will
be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
proceedings. The multijurisdictional nature of enforcement over the Collateral may limit the realizable value of
the Collateral.

Moreover, in certain jurisdictions, it is unclear whether all security interests in the Collateral give the Security
Agent a right to prevent other creditors from foreclosing on and realizing the Collateral or whether certain
security interests only give the Security Agent priority in the distribution of any proceeds of such realization.
Accordingly, the Security Agent and holders of the Notes may not be able to avoid foreclosure by other creditors
(including unsecured creditors) on the Collateral.

###### You may be unable to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities laws violations

The Issuer is organized under the laws of Sweden and the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Sweden,
Norway and Finland. Neither the Issuer nor the Guarantors have assets in the United States. Some or all of the
directors and executive officers of the Issuer may be non-residents of the United States and many of their assets
will be located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of
process within the United States upon the Issuer or its directors and executive officers, or to enforce any
judgments obtained in U.S. courts predicated upon civil liability provisions of U.S. securities laws. In addition,
the Issuer cannot assure investors that civil liabilities predicated upon federal securities laws of the United
States will be enforceable in Sweden. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees
_and the Security Interests.”_

###### Risks Related to Our Financial Profile

 Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations may make it difficult for us to fulfil our obligations under the Notes and operate our business

We have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness with significant debt service requirements. On a pro
forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, the Issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries’ total financial
indebtedness (including the Notes) would have been SEK 6,257 million (approximately €557 million) as of
March 31, 2023.

Our significant leverage could have important consequences for holders of the Notes, including, but not limited
to:

62


-----

  - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our other debt
and liabilities;

  - requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our debt instead of
operations, thus reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund internal growth through working
capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures, product research and development, and other
general corporate purposes;

  - increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, a downturn in our business,
or generally adverse economic or industry conditions;

  - placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged
as us;

  - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive
environment and industry;

  - restricting us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or exploiting certain business opportunities;

  - limiting, among other things, our and our subsidiaries’ ability to borrow additional funds, including
with respect to financial leases on which we rely for replacement and expansion of our vehicle fleet,
or raise equity capital in the future and increasing the costs of such additional financings;

  - exposing us to risks that are inherent in interest rate fluctuations because certain of our indebtedness
(including the Notes) bears variable rates of interest; and

  - subjecting us to restrictive covenants, including, in the case of our Super Senior Facilities, financial
covenants, the non-compliance with which could result in an event of default under, or acceleration
of, our indebtedness.

We primarily expect to use cash flow from operations and borrowings under our Super Senior Facilities to
finance our operations, service our indebtedness and fund capital expenditures. Our ability to make these
payments depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic,
regulatory and other factors, many of which we cannot control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash
flow from operations in the future, which could result in us being unable to service or repay indebtedness or
fund other liquidity needs. If we cannot service our indebtedness and meet our other obligations and
commitments, we might be required to refinance our debt or dispose of assets to obtain funds for such purpose.
We cannot assure you that such refinancings or asset disposals could be effected on a timely basis or on
satisfactory terms, if at all, or would be permitted by the terms of our debt instruments.

###### Despite our high level of indebtedness and restrictive covenants, we and our subsidiaries will still be able to incur significant additional amounts of debt or make certain restricted payments, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage

We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including additional secured
indebtedness, in the future. Although the Indenture and the Super Senior Facilities Agreements will contain
restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant
qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness (including secured
indebtedness) that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Following this
Offering, we expect to have SEK 1,100 million immediately available for borrowing under our new Revolving
Credit Facility, and SEK 300 million under our Guarantee Facility, which may be increased in accordance with
the terms described in “Description of the Notes” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—The
_Super Senior Facilities”. See “—The Collateral may not be sufficient to secure the obligations under the Notes.”_

63


-----

Under the Indenture, in addition to specified permitted debt, we will be able to incur additional indebtedness so
long as on a pro forma basis our fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Indenture) is at least 2.0 to 1.0
and such indebtedness may be secured by a first-priority lien on the Collateral securing the Notes so long as on
a pro forma basis our consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio (as calculated in accordance with the
“Description of the Notes”) is no greater than 4.5 to 1.0. In addition, neither the Indenture nor the agreement
governing our Super Senior Facilities will prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute
indebtedness under those agreements. Moreover, the Indenture will permit us incur additional debt that is pari
_passu with the Notes and, in certain circumstances, receive proceeds from enforcement of Collateral prior to_
the Notes. See “—Risks Related to the Notes and the Collateral Risks Related to the Notes and the Collateral
_Creditors under the Super Senior Facilities, any credit facility that refinances or replaces the Super Senior_
_Facilities, certain hedging obligations and certain other indebtedness and obligations permitted to be incurred_
_on a priority basis under the Indenture are entitled to be repaid in priority to the Notes.” In addition, some of_
the debt we may incur in the future could be effectively and structurally senior to the Notes and may be secured
by collateral that does not secure the Notes. The incurrence of additional debt would increase the leveragerelated risks described in this offering memorandum. If we are able to designate some of our restricted
subsidiaries under the Indenture as unrestricted subsidiaries, those unrestricted subsidiaries would be permitted
to borrow beyond the limitations specified in the Indenture and engage in other activities in which restricted
subsidiaries may not engage. We are also permitted to invest in joint ventures and acquisitions, which may
increase our indebtedness. Moreover, although the Indenture and the agreements governing our Super Senior
Facilities will contain restrictions on our ability to make restricted payments, including the declaration and
payment of dividends, we will be able to make substantial restricted payments under certain circumstances.
Under the Indenture, for example, we will be able to make dividends, distributions, loans or other payments to
any Parent (as defined therein) so long as on a pro forma basis our specified consolidated total net leverage
ratio (as calculated in accordance with the “Description of the Notes”) does not exceed 3.25 to 1.0 on a net basis
(or 3.5 to 1.0 with respect to certain investments). Adding new debt to our and our subsidiaries’ existing debt
levels or making restricted payments could exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage
described above, including our possible inability to service our debt.

###### We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, including due to factors outside our control, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful

Our ability to service our indebtedness will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by
prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors. Some of these factors are
beyond our control. In addition, our ability to borrow funds in the future to make payments on our debt will
depend on the satisfaction of the covenants in our debt agreements, including the Indenture, and other
agreements we may enter into in the future. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash
flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to
make interest and principal payments on our debt, including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs.

If our cash flows from operations and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt obligations, we may be
forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital, forego opportunities, or seek
to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes. These alternative measures may not be
successful and may not be sufficient to enable us to meet our scheduled debt obligations. In the absence of such
cash flows and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be required to sell material
assets to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those asset
sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices and on terms that we believe are fair, and any proceeds that we
receive may not be adequate to meet any debt obligations then due. If we cannot meet our debt obligations, the
holders of our debt may accelerate our debt and, to the extent such debt is secured, foreclose on our assets
securing such debt. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay all of our debt.

64


-----

In addition, any failure to make payments of interest or principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely
basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional
indebtedness. For a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”_

###### We are subject to restrictive debt covenants limit our flexibility in operating our business and our ability to raise additional funds

The Indenture and the agreements governing our Super Senior Facilities will contain covenants that
significantly restrict our ability to:

  - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;

  - incur or permit to exist certain liens;

  - make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions, with respect to Capital Stock;

  - prepay or redeem subordinated debt or Capital Stock;

  - make certain loans or other investments;

  - create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or
advances to, and on the transfer of assets to the Issuer or any of its restricted subsidiaries;

  - sell, lease or transfer certain assets, including Capital Stock of restricted subsidiaries;

  - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

  - issue or sell the share capital of certain subsidiaries;

  - consummate a change of control;

  - consolidate or merge with other entities or sell substantially all of our assets; and

  - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes.

Each of the covenants is subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Super Senior Facilities” and “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—_
_Certain Covenants.” Despite these exceptions and qualifications, the covenants that will be contained in the_
Indenture and the agreements governing our Super Senior Facilities could materially affect our ability to operate
our business and may limit our ability to react to market conditions, raise additional debt or equity financing to
operate during general economic or business downturns, take advantage of potential business opportunities as
they arise or grow in accordance with our strategy. For example, such restrictions could adversely affect our
ability to finance our operations, make strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances, restructure our
organization or finance our capital needs.

Additionally, our Super Senior Facilities Agreements will require us to maintain a senior secured net leverage
ratio and our ability to meet that financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control, including
prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. A breach of any of those covenants or restrictions could
result in an event of default under the agreement governing the Super Senior Facilities, and the relevant lenders,
subject to applicable cure periods and other limitations on acceleration or enforcement, could cancel the
availability of the Super Senior Facilities and elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder, together with
accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, a default under the agreement governing the Super
Senior Facilities could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain
cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, including the Indenture. If our creditors, including the lenders
under the Super Senior Facilities, accelerate the payment of those amounts, we cannot assure you that our assets

6


-----

and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, and to satisfy all other
liabilities of our subsidiaries which would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the
Notes, in full or in part. In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could proceed against
any collateral granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts.

###### The Notes and drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at floating rates that could rise significantly, increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow

The Notes will bear interest at floating rates of interest per annum equal to EURIBOR and drawings under the
Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at floating rates of interest per annum equal to STIBOR in relation
to cash advances in Swedish krona (or, in relation to cash advances in euro, EURIBOR, in relation to cash
advances in Norwegian kroner, NIBOR, and, in relation to cash advances in Danish krona, CIBOR, as adjusted
periodically, plus a spread. In addition, the Indenture will permit us to incur additional indebtedness, which may
bear a floating rate of interest. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future. To the extent that interest
rates or any drawings were to increase significantly our interest expense would correspondingly increase,
reducing our cash flow. Although we may enter into certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of
these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will be available or continue to be available on commercially
reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount
(including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. Further, there may be a mismatch between the
successor rates applied in respect of the Group’s floating rate debt and the successor rates applied in respect of
hedging arrangements thereon, which may render such hedging arrangements ineffective in managing the
Group’s interest rate risks.

###### Uncertainty relating to the calculation of EURIBOR or a discontinuance of similar rates or any regulatory reform affecting EURIBOR or similar rates may materially adversely affect the value of and return on our floating rate debt, including the Notes

EURIBOR, other interest rates, equity, foreign exchange rates and other types of rates and indices that are
deemed to be “benchmarks” are the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory discussions and
proposals for reform. Some of these reforms are already effective whilst others are still to be implemented.

Regulation (EU) No. 2016/1011 (the “Benchmarks Regulation”) and Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 as it forms
part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK Benchmarks Regulation”) apply to the provision
of benchmarks, the contribution of input data to a benchmark and the use of benchmarks within the European
Union or the UK (as applicable). The Benchmarks Regulation and the UK Benchmarks Regulation could have
a material impact on the Notes offered hereby linked to EURIBOR or another benchmark rate of index, in
particular if the methodology or other terms of the benchmark are changed in order to comply with either of
their terms, and such changes could (amongst other things) have the effect of reducing or increasing the rate or
level, or affecting the volatility of the published rate or level, of the benchmark. More broadly, any of the
international, national or other proposals for reform, or the general increased regulatory scrutiny of benchmarks,
could increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of a benchmark and
complying with any such regulations or requirements. Such factors may have the effect of discouraging market
participants from continuing to administer or contribute to certain “benchmarks,” trigger changes in the rules
or methodologies used in certain “benchmarks” or lead to the discontinuance or unavailability of quotes of
certain “benchmarks.”

As an example of such benchmark reforms, on March 5, 2021, the FCA confirmed that all LIBOR settings will
either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative: (i) immediately after December
31, 2021, in the case of all sterling, euro, Swiss franc and Japanese yen settings, and the 1-week and 2-month
U.S. dollar settings; and (ii) immediately after June 30, 2023, in the case of the remaining U.S. dollar settings.
In addition, on November 29, 2017, the Bank of England and the FCA announced that, from January 2018, its

66


-----

working group on Sterling risk free rates has been mandated with implementing a broad based transition to the
90 Sterling Overnight Index Average (“SONIA”) over the next four years across sterling bond, loan and
derivative markets so that SONIA is established as the primary sterling interest rate benchmark by the end of
2021.

On September 21, 2017, the European Central Bank announced that it would be part of a new working group
tasked with the identification and adoption of a “risk free overnight rate” which can serve as a basis for an
alternative to current benchmarks used in a variety of financial instruments and contracts in the euro area. On
September 13, 2018, the working group on Euro risk-free rates recommended the new Euro short-term rate
(“€STR”) as the new risk-free rate for the euro area. The €STR was published for the first time on October 2,
2019. Although EURIBOR has been reformed in order to comply with the terms of the Benchmark Regulation,
it remains uncertain as to how long it will continue in its current form, or whether it will be further reformed or
replaced with €STR or an alternative benchmark.

The elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or the potential elimination of any other benchmark, changes in the
manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result
in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or LIBOR is determined, which could require an adjustment to
the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark
(including but not limited to the Super Senior Facilities and the Notes whose interest rates are linked to
EURIBOR). Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden
or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt
that bears interest at floating rates of interest.

The Indenture will provide a mechanism whereby, if EURIBOR is no longer being calculated or administered,
the Issuer could cause an independent financial advisor to determine an appropriate successor rate, and make
certain adjustments to such rate, including applying a spread thereon to make such successor rate substantially
comparable to EURIBOR, which upon certification by the Issuer to each of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent
and the Paying Agent will be used to calculate the interest rate in relation to the Notes without any further action
or consent by the Holders or the Trustee. This would mean that interest on the Notes would be determined on
the basis of a benchmark rate, together with adjustments, that was not contemplated at the time you purchased
the Notes issued on the Issue Date. In addition, due to the uncertainty concerning the availability of an
appropriate successor rate and the involvement of an independent financial advisor, the Indenture’s successor
rate mechanism may not operate as intended at the relevant time.

Any elimination of the EURIBOR benchmark, or changes in the manner of administration of EURIBOR, could
require an adjustment to the terms and conditions of our floating rate debt. Any such consequence could have a
material adverse effect on the value of and return on any such floating rate debt. If EURIBOR were discontinued
or otherwise unavailable, the rate of interest on our floating rate debt will be determined for the relevant period
by the fallback provisions applicable to such debt.

###### Risks Related to the Notes and the Collateral

 Creditors under the Super Senior Facilities, any credit facility that refinances or replaces the Super Senior Facilities, certain hedging obligations and certain other indebtedness and obligations (including any future guarantee facilities) permitted to be incurred on a priority basis under the Indenture are entitled to be repaid in priority to the Notes

Following the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed by the same entities that also guarantee the Super Senior
Facilities. Furthermore, the Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be secured initially on a first-priority basis by
the same Collateral securing the obligations under the Super Senior Facilities. In addition, under the terms of
the Indenture, we will be permitted to incur significant additional indebtedness and other obligations that may

6


-----

be secured by the same Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Notes and, in certain circumstances, receive
proceeds from enforcement of Collateral prior to the Notes. The Indenture will permit and the Intercreditor
Agreement permits hedging and certain other indebtedness and obligations (including any future guarantee
facilities) incurred in accordance with the Indenture to be secured on a priority basis in respect of proceeds from
the enforcement of the Collateral.

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the first priority security interests securing the Notes are contractually
deemed to rank equally with the security interests that secure (but only to the extent that such security is
expressed to secure those liabilities) (i) obligations under the Super Senior Facilities, including obligations
under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Guarantee Facility and the Pension Guarantee Facility, (ii) certain
obligations under hedging arrangements and (iii) certain other future indebtedness and obligations (including
any future guarantee facilities) permitted to be incurred under the Indenture. Such security interests are, or will
be, evidenced by security documents for the benefit of (whether directly or through the Security Agent) the
holders of the Notes, the lenders under the Super Senior Facilities and/or the holders of certain other future
indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the Indenture. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement,
subject to certain conditions, in the event of acceleration of the Super Senior Facilities or the Notes or other
secured obligations, amounts recovered in respect of the Collateral, will be required to repay indebtedness in
respect of the Super Senior Facilities, including obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Guarantee
Facility and the Pension Guarantee Facility, as well as certain Hedging Obligations, certain future indebtedness
and obligations (including any future guarantee facilities) and hedging obligations (if any) in priority to the
Notes, following the payment of fees and expenses of the agent under the Super Senior Facilities, the Trustee
and the Security Agent (and any receiver or delegate) and any fees and expenses of any other creditor
representative of future indebtedness permitted under the terms of the Indenture to benefit from such security
interests. As a result, proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may be insufficient to pay claims under
the Notes. In addition, claims of our secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also secure the
Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Notes.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that a common security agent, who will serve as the Security Agent for
the secured parties with respect to the Collateral, will act only as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement.
The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Collateral unless otherwise instructed by the Instructing
Group (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) for the purpose of enforcement. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—Security.”_

Creditors under Super Senior Facilities or under other indebtedness or obligations that are secured on a priority
basis with respect to proceeds from the enforcement of Collateral may have interests that are different from the
interests of holders of the Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to
pursue their remedies under the security documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders
of the Notes to do so.

In addition, if the Security Agent sells the Collateral as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees and the liens over any other assets
of such entities securing such Notes and Notes Guarantees may be released. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—Security.”_

###### Holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral

To the extent permitted under applicable law, and subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Notes will be
secured on a first-ranking basis by substantially the same rights, property and assets securing the obligations
under the Super Senior Facilities, including obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Guarantee
Facility and the Pension Guarantee Facility. In addition, under the terms of the Indenture, we will be permitted
to incur significant additional indebtedness and other obligations that may be secured by the same Collateral.

68


-----

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, a common security agent will serve as the Security Agent for the
secured parties under the Super Senior Facilities, the Notes and the hedging arrangements (if any), respectively,
with regard to the shared Collateral (as applicable). The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Security
Agent will, subject to certain limited exceptions, act to enforce the security interests in the Collateral and take
instructions from the relevant secured creditors in respect of the Collateral only at the direction of an
“instructing group.”

Generally, if there are conflicting enforcement instructions received by the Security Agent from the different
classes of creditors which are secured by the Collateral and who can constitute either “majority super super
senior creditors” (generally lenders under the Pension Guarantee Facility and any additional Pension Guarantee
Facility whose credit participations represent more than 66[2]/3 per cent. of the aggregate credit participations of
all Pension Guarantee Facility lenders), “majority super senior creditors” (generally, creditors representing more
than 50 per cent. of the aggregate of all unpaid and undrawn commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility
and the Guarantee Facility (or any replacement thereof) and the termination value or assumed termination value
of certain future “super priority” hedging obligations, if any) or “majority senior secured creditors” (generally,
creditors representing the majority of the outstanding principal amount under the Notes, any pari passu secured
indebtedness and the termination value or assumed termination value of certain future hedging obligations
which are not given “super priority” status, if any), as the case may be, the representatives of the creditors
sharing in the Collateral are required to first consult in good faith with each other (in each case, including the
Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes, the agent on behalf of lenders under the Pension Guarantee Facility
(or any replacement thereof) and the agent on behalf of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility (or any
replacement thereof) and the Security Agent, for a period of 15 days (or such shorter period as may be agreed)
with a view to coordinating the instructions to be given by an instructing group and agreeing an enforcement
strategy (a “joint enforcement strategy”). Upon conclusion of this “consultation period”, if the relevant creditor
representatives are unable to agree on a joint enforcement strategy or if conflicting enforcement instructions are
received by the Security Agent from the different classes of creditors which are secured by the Collateral and
who can constitute an instructing group, and provided that the “security enforcement principles” set out in the
Intercreditor Agreement have been complied with, then the majority senior secured creditors shall constitute an
instructing group and shall have the right to instruct the Security Agent as to the enforcement of the Collateral.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no consultation period shall be required if either (i) any of the Collateral
becomes enforceable because of an insolvency event in respect of the Issuer or certain members of the Group,
(ii) the majority super super senior creditors, majority super senior creditors or the majority senior secured
creditors determine in good faith that entering into consultation could reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any of the Collateral or to reduce the amount likely to
be realized upon enforcement of the Collateral to a level such that the obligations to the “super senior creditors”
would not be discharged in full, or (iii) the relevant creditor representatives are in agreement as to any proposed
enforcement action, in which case, the Security Agent shall act in accordance with the instructions provided by
the majority senior secured creditors (provided that such instructions are consistent with the security
enforcement principles set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement).

Generally, if the Security Agent is obliged to follow the enforcement instructions of the majority senior secured
creditors as discussed above and either (i) the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility (or any replacement
thereof) (together with any “super priority” hedging obligations) have not been repaid in full within six months
of the end of the consultation period, (ii) the Security Agent has not commenced any enforcement action (or
any transaction in lieu) in respect of the relevant Collateral within three months of the end of the consultation
period or (iii) an insolvency event has occurred in respect of the Issuer or certain members of the Group and
the Security Agent has not commenced enforcement (or any transaction in lieu) of the relevant Collateral or
taken any other enforcement action at that time, then, the Security Agent shall, provided that the security
enforcement principles set out in the Intercreditor Agreement have been complied with, instead follow the

69


-----

instructions that are given by the majority super senior creditors (and the terms of the relevant previous
enforcement instructions of the majority senior secured creditors which conflict with the instructions of the
majority super senior creditors shall be deemed revoked).

Further, generally, if the Security Agent is obliged to follow the enforcement instructions of the majority super
senior creditors or the majority senior secured creditors as discussed above and either (i) the lenders under the
Pension Guarantee Facility (or any replacement thereof) have not been repaid in full within twelve months of
the end of the consultation period, (ii) the Security Agent has not commenced any enforcement action (or any
transaction in lieu) in respect of the relevant Collateral within nine months of the end of the consultation period
or (iii) an insolvency event has occurred in respect of the Issuer or certain members of the Group and the
Security Agent has not commenced enforcement (or any transaction in lieu) of the relevant Collateral or taken
any other enforcement action at that time, then, the Security Agent shall, provided that the security enforcement
principles set out in the Intercreditor Agreement have been complied with, instead follow the instructions that
are given by the majority super super senior creditors (and the terms of the relevant previous enforcement
instructions of the majority senior secured creditors or majority super senior secured creditors which conflict
with the instructions of the majority super senior creditors shall be deemed revoked).

The foregoing security enforcement arrangements could be disadvantageous to the holders of the Notes in a
number of respects.

Disputes may occur between the holders of the Notes and creditors under our Super Senior Facilities (under
any of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Guarantee Facility and the Pension Guarantee Facility), counterparties
to certain hedging arrangements, if any, and/or holders of any permitted pari passu secured indebtedness as to
the appropriate manner of pursuing enforcement remedies and strategies with respect to the Collateral securing
such obligations. In such an event, the holders of the Notes will be bound by any decisions of the relevant
instructing group, which may result in enforcement action in respect of the relevant Collateral, whether or not
such action is approved by the holders of the Notes or may be adverse to such holders of Notes. The creditors
under the Super Senior Facilities (under any of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Guarantee Facility and the
Pension Guarantee Facility), counterparties to certain hedging arrangements, if any, or the holders of any
permitted pari passu secured indebtedness may have interests that are different from the interest of holders of
the Notes and they may elect to pursue their remedies under the relevant Security Documents at a time when it
would otherwise be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so.

Other creditors not party to the Intercreditor Agreement could commence enforcement action against the Issuer
or one or more of the Issuer’s subsidiaries during the consultation period or the Issuer or one or more of the
Issuer’s subsidiaries could seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws, or the value of certain Collateral
could otherwise be impaired or reduced in value. In addition, if we incur substantial additional indebtedness
which may be secured on the Collateral, the holders of the Notes may not comprise the requisite majority senior
secured creditors for the purposes of instructing the Security Agent. Further, if the super senior creditors have
not been repaid in full within six months of the end of the consultation period or in the event of the occurrence
of certain other circumstances described above, then control of the enforcement proceedings will shift to the
majority super senior creditors and if the super super senior creditors have not been repaid in full within twelve
months of the end of the consultation period or in the event of the occurrence of certain other circumstances
described above, then control of the enforcement proceedings will shift to the majority super super senior
creditors.

The holders of the Notes will also have no separate right to enforce the Collateral securing the Notes. In addition,
the holders of the Notes will not be able to instruct the Security Agent, force a sale of Collateral or otherwise
independently pursue the remedies of a secured creditor under the relevant Security Documents, unless they
comprise an instructing group which is entitled to give such instructions, which, in turn, will depend on certain
conditions and circumstances including those described above.

-----

In addition, if the Security Agent sells any of the Collateral as a result of an enforcement action in accordance
with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Notes and over any other assets securing the Notes may be
released. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description
_of the Notes—Security— Release of Liens.”_

###### The Collateral may not be sufficient to secure the obligations under the Notes

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be secured by first-priority security interests in the Collateral described
in this offering memorandum, which Collateral also secures the obligations under the Super Senior Facilities,
certain hedging obligations and may secure certain future obligations. The Revolving Credit Facility is part of
the Super Senior Facilities which also include an initial SEK 300 million Guarantee Facility and an initial SEK
375 million Pension Guarantee Facility. We may increase the amounts available under Super Senior Facilities
or incur additional super senior liabilities (including under any future guarantee facilities) as a result of which
the amount of indebtedness and obligations that will benefit from “super priority” first-priority security interests
in the Collateral may be increased up to the amount permitted under the Indenture. The Indenture will not
prohibit any increases to the amount of the Pension Guarantee Facility or the Guarantee Facility and will not
prohibit entry into any future guarantee facilities secured on the Collateral nor will it provide any cap in respect
of such amounts. Thus the amount of any obligations under the Pension Guarantee Facility or the Guarantee
Facility (or other facilities utilized for the same purposes) will be secured in priority to the Notes. The Collateral
may also secure additional debt ranking pari passu with the Notes to the extent permitted by the terms of the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The rights of the holders of the Notes to the Collateral may therefore
be diluted by any increase in the debt secured by first-priority liens on the Collateral.

If there is an event of default on the Notes, the holders of the Notes will be secured only by the Collateral. There
is no guarantee that the value of the Collateral will be sufficient to enable the Issuer to satisfy its obligations
under each series of the Notes. The proceeds of any sale of the Collateral following an event of default with
respect to the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy, and may be substantially less than, amounts due on the
Notes.

The value of the Collateral is based on certain assumptions. The fair market value of the Collateral at any point
in time may be subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, general economic conditions,
industry conditions and similar factors. The amount to be received upon an enforcement of such Collateral will
depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, the
condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers, whether or not our
business is sold as a going concern, the ability to readily liquidate the Collateral and the fair market value and
condition of the Collateral. Furthermore, there may not be any buyer willing and able to purchase our business
as a going concern, or willing to buy a significant portion of our assets in the event of an enforcement action.
As a result, the book value of the Collateral should not be conclusively relied on as a measure of realizable
value for such assets following the occurrence of an event of default or enforcement event under the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture or the Super Senior Facilities. All or a portion of the Collateral may be
illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, we cannot assure you that there will be
a market for the sale of the Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in our
liquidation. In addition, the security granted over the shares of an entity may be of no value if that entity is
subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding.

To the extent that liens, security interests and other rights granted to other parties encumber assets owned by
the Issuer or the Guarantors, those parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property
subject to their liens, security interests or other rights that could adversely affect the value of that Collateral and
the ability of the Security Agent, the Trustee or investors as holders of the Notes to realize or enforce that
Collateral. If the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes and
the Notes Guarantees, investors (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would

1


-----

have only an unsecured claim (if the relevant guarantee has not been released) against the Issuer’s and the
Guarantors’ remaining assets. Each of these factors or any challenge to the validity of the Collateral or the
intercreditor arrangement governing our creditors’ rights could reduce the proceeds realized upon enforcement
of the Collateral.

In addition, the Collateral may not be liquid, and its value to other parties may be less than its value to us.
Likewise, we cannot assure you that there will be a market for the pledged shares or other Collateral or, if such
market does exist, that there will not be substantial delays in their liquidation. In addition, the value of this
Collateral may fluctuate over time.

###### The Collateral secures amounts under certain guarantee facilities and future guarantee facilities which are more likely to become due in circumstances when an enforcement action may be taken

The Super Senior Facilities comprise the Revolving Credit Facility, the Guarantee Facility and the Pension
Guarantee Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized by the drawing of cash advances, the issue
of bank guarantees and documentary credits (including letters of credit and performance bonds) and by way of
ancillary facilities. The Guarantee Facility may be utilized by the issue of letters of credits, bank guarantees and
by way of ancillary facilities by way of guarantee facilities and the Pension Guarantee Facility may be utilized
by the issue of bank guarantees and by way of ancillary facilities by way of pension guarantee facilities. The
Pension Guarantee Facility is intended to provide a guarantee required by the Swedish pension regulatory
authorities in respect of the Group’s defined benefit pensions obligations.

In the ordinary course of business, amounts under the Guarantee Facility (including under any future guarantee
facilities) and the Pension Guarantee Facility are likely to operate in a contingent manner rather than requiring
immediate repayment. However, in the types of circumstances where the Collateral may become enforceable,
including upon a payment default or insolvency related default under the Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility,
the Guarantee Facility (including under any future guarantee facilities) or the Pension Guarantee Facility, these
contingent claims are more likely to crystallize. This may occur, for instance, if contractual parties that have
been provided guarantees under project contracts will call on their guarantees. This will mean that amounts
under such facilities will become due and payable, and as discussed above, will recover the proceeds of
Collateral in priority to the Notes.

As described above, if the Super Senior Facilities are not repaid in full in prescribed amounts of time as set
forth in the Intercreditor Agreement, creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and Guarantee Facility
(including under any future guarantee facilities) as super senior creditors and / or creditors under the Pension
Guarantee Facility as super super senior creditors will become the instructing group for enforcement of the
security.

###### The Notes will not be initially secured by all of the Collateral and the Guarantors will not initially guarantee the Notes

On the Issue Date, the Notes will not be secured by all of the Collateral, as further described under “Description
_of the Notes—Security.” On the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured by the Issue Date Collateral. Within 90_
days of the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured by the Post-Closing Collateral. The security interests will be
limited to the same extent as those under the Super Senior Facilities and otherwise as set forth under “Certain
_Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the_
_Security Interests,” which limitations could be significant. It should be noted that if a guarantee or a security_
interest granted by a Guarantor in certain jurisdictions is granted or perfected after the secured obligation arose,
such guarantee or security interest may be subject to claw-back provisions under applicable local insolvency
laws.

2


-----

The Notes will not be guaranteed on the Issue Date. Within 90 days following the Issue Date, the obligations
of the Issuer pursuant to the Notes will, subject to the agreed security principles, be guaranteed, jointly and
severally on a senior basis, by the Guarantors. Each of the Guarantors will also be a guarantor under the Super
Senior Facilities (which includes the Pension Guarantee Facility and the Guarantee Facility). The validity and
enforceability of the Notes Guarantees will be subject to significant limitations as described in “Certain
_Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the_
_Security Interests.” As of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, the Guarantors represented 79.8_
per cent. of our revenues, 79.5 per cent. of our EBITDA and over 100 per cent. of our assets (other than goodwill
and shares in subsidiaries), in each case, calculated on a stand-alone basis without giving effect to intra-group
eliminations. On an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions as of March 31, 2023, the
subsidiaries of the Issuer that will not guarantee the Notes would have had SEK 128 million outstanding external
financial indebtedness.

###### It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes

The Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and
other imperfections permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement and accepted by other
creditors that have the benefit of security interests in the Collateral from time to time. The existence of any such
exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the
Collateral securing the Notes, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such
Collateral. Furthermore, the first priority ranking of security interests with respect to the Notes can be affected
by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory
liens or re-characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions.

The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the
realization of security interests in the Collateral. For example, the enforcement of share pledges, whether by
means of a public auction or a private sale, may be subject to certain specific requirements and the Security
Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third-party to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that
the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any
third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security
Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly
decrease. See “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the
_Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests” for further information._

###### The granting of the security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the incurrence of permitted debt or other obligations in the future, may create or restart hardening periods

The granting of security interests to secure the Notes and the Notes Guarantees may create hardening periods
for such security interests. The granting of shared security interests to secure future indebtedness or other
obligations permitted to be secured on the Collateral may restart or reopen such hardening periods in particular,
because the Indenture will permit the release and retaking of security granted in favor of the Notes in certain
circumstances, including in connection with the incurrence of future indebtedness. The applicable hardening
period for these new security interests can run from the moment each new security interest has been granted,
perfected or recreated. Each time, if the security interest granted, perfected or recreated were to be enforced
before the end of the respective hardening period, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be
possible to enforce it. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the Notes would
lose the benefit of the security interest.

The same rights and risks also will apply with respect to future security interests granted in connection with the
accession of further subsidiaries as additional Guarantors and the granting of security interests over their
relevant assets and equity interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes. See “Certain Insolvency

3


-----

_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security_
_Interests.”_

###### Your rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected, and its priority retained,
through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor, as applicable, of the security. The
liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we fail
or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens. Certain of the Collateral may not be
perfected under Swedish, Norwegian or Finnish or other laws, including certain share pledges pending a
potential intra-group merger, intra-group loan pledges and certain bank account pledges.

Absent perfection, the holder of the security interest may have difficulty enforcing such holder’s rights in the
Collateral with regard to third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security
interest in the same Collateral and some security interests do not actually create the purported security interest
if not properly perfected. In addition, a debtor may discharge its obligation by paying the security provider until,
but not after, the debtor receives a notification of the existence of the security interest granted by the security
provider in favor of the security taken over the claims the security taker (as creditor) has against the debtor.
Finally, since the ranking of pledges is sometimes determined by the date on which they became enforceable
against third parties, a security interest created on a later date over the same Collateral, but which came into
force for third parties earlier (by way of registration in the appropriate register or by notification) may have
priority. Neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent has any obligation or responsibility to monitor the
acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute collateral or the perfection of, or to take steps or
actions to perfect or ensure the perfection of, any security interest in the Notes against third parties. See “Certain
_Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the_
_Security Interests” for further information._

###### The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent (on behalf of the holders of the Notes) rather than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted by local law

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the
obligations of the Guarantors under the Notes Guarantees will not be granted directly to the holders of the
relevant Notes but will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent, which will hold the Collateral on behalf
of the lenders under the Super Senior Facilities and our hedging obligations, the holders of the Notes and the
holders of any additional debt secured by Collateral permitted to be incurred under the Indenture. The Indenture
will provide (along with the Intercreditor Agreement) that only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the
Security Documents. As a consequence, holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not
be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee,
who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the
Collateral. See “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the
_Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests” for further information._

It is generally possible under Swedish law to grant security interests in favor of an agent acting on behalf of
secured parties. However, to enable the Security Agent to enforce the security interests in the Collateral on
behalf of the holders of the Notes in a Swedish court, the Security Agent may need a specific power of attorney
from each holder of the Notes. It has not been established by judicial precedent or otherwise by law that a power
of attorney or mandate of agency, including the appointment of an agent can be made irrevocable. Therefore,
any powers of attorney or mandates of agency can be revoked and will terminate by operation of law and
without notice at the bankruptcy or temporal demise of the party giving such powers. In addition, the failure of

4


-----

all holders of the Notes to submit such a power of attorney could negatively affect the enforcement of the
security interests in the Collateral. It should further be noted that certain security interests will be unperfected
and subject to a hardening period, please refer to the Offering for further description of the security to be
granted. The applicable hardening period for these new security interests will run from the moment each new
security interest has been granted and perfected. If the security interest granted or recreated were to be enforced
before the end of the hardening period, it may be declared void or ineffective and it may not be possible to
enforce it.

###### The Issuer and the Guarantors will have control over the Collateral securing the Notes, and the sale of particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes

The Security Documents will allow the Issuer and the Guarantors to remain in possession of, retain exclusive
control over, freely operate and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the Collateral securing the Notes.
So long as no default or event of default under the Indenture would result therefrom, the Issuer and the
Guarantors may, among other things, without any release or consent by the Security Agent, conduct ordinary
course activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of
the Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of indebtedness.

There are circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of Notes under which the Collateral securing
the Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be released automatically and under which the Notes Guarantees will
be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Trustee

Under various circumstances, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Notes will be released
automatically. See “Description of the Notes—Notes Guarantees” and “Description of the Notes—Security—
_Release of Liens.” In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral comprising the shares of any of our_
subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, then claims
under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees may be released or transferred. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes— Security—Release of_
_Liens.” Your ability to recover on the Notes could be materially impaired in such circumstances._

The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that the Collateral securing the Notes may be released and retaken
in connection with the refinancing of certain indebtedness, including the Notes. Such a release and retaking of
Collateral may give rise to the start of a new “hardening period” in respect of such Collateral. Under certain
circumstances, other creditors, insolvency administrators or representatives or courts could challenge the
validity and enforceability of the grant of such Collateral. Any such challenge, if successful, could potentially
limit your recovery in respect of such Collateral and thus reduce your recovery under the Notes. See also “—
_The granting of the security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the incurrence of permitted_
_debt or other obligations in the future, may create or restart hardening periods.”_

###### The Issuer does not have revenue generating operations of its own and will depend on cash flows from operating companies to make payments on the Notes

The Issuer does not have any revenue-generating activities of its own and does not have any business operations
or material assets (other than its shareholding in Assemblin Group). Repayment of the Issuer’s indebtedness,
including under the Notes, is dependent on the profitability and cash flow of its subsidiaries and their ability to
make such cash available to the Issuer, by dividend distributions, or otherwise. The subsidiaries of the Issuer
may not be able to, or may be restricted by the terms of their existing or future indebtedness, or by law, in their
ability to make distributions or advance upstream loans to enable us to make payments in respect of our
indebtedness, including the Notes. Each of the subsidiaries of the Issuer is a distinct legal entity and, under
certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from the subsidiaries
of the Issuer.


-----

While the Indenture and the Super Senior Facilities, respectively, will limit the ability of the Group’s
subsidiaries to incur contractual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany
payments to us, such limitations are subject to certain significant qualifications and exceptions. In the event that
we do not receive distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required
principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, including the Notes. We do not expect to have any other
sources of funds that would allow us to make payments to holders of the Notes.

###### The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-Guarantor members of our Group

Some, but not all, of the members of the Group will guarantee the Notes. As of and for the twelve months ended
March 31, 2023, the Guarantors represented 79.8 per cent. of our revenues, 79.5 per cent. of our EBITDA and
over 100 per cent. of our assets (other than goodwill and shares in subsidiaries), in each case, calculated on a
stand-alone basis without giving effect to intra-group eliminations. On an as adjusted basis after giving effect
to the Transactions as of March 31, 2023, the subsidiaries of the Issuer that will not guarantee the Notes would
have had SEK 128 million outstanding external financial indebtedness.

Unless a member of our Group is a Guarantor, such member will not have any obligations to pay amounts due
under the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose. The Indenture will, subject to some limitations,
permit our non-Guarantor restricted subsidiaries to incur substantial amounts of additional indebtedness and
will not restrict the amount of other liabilities that may be incurred by these subsidiaries. Generally, holders of
indebtedness of, and trade creditors of, non-guarantor companies, including lenders under bank financing
agreements, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such non-Guarantor companies before
these assets are made available for distribution to the Issuer or any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder.

Accordingly, in the event that any non-Guarantor company becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or
dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction:

  - the creditors of the Issuer (including the holders of the Notes) and the Guarantors will have no right to
proceed against the assets of such company; and

  - the creditors of such non-guarantor company, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to
payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such company before any Guarantor, as
a direct or indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary.

As such, the Notes and each Notes Guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade
creditors) and any preferred stockholders of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries.

###### The Notes Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability

The Notes will be guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries which are incorporated under the laws of Sweden,
Norway and Finland and will be secured by security interests over the Collateral, which will be governed by
the laws of these jurisdictions. The Indenture will provide that the Notes Guarantees, and the Indenture and the
relevant Security Documents will provide that the security interests, will be limited to the maximum amount
that can be guaranteed, or otherwise, or in respect of which security interests may be granted, by the relevant
Guarantor or grantor, as applicable, without rendering the relevant Notes Guarantee or security interest, as it
relates to that Guarantor or grantor, voidable or otherwise ineffective or limited under applicable law. See
“Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees
_and the Security Interests.”_

-----

In addition, enforcement of any of the Notes Guarantees against any Guarantor or security interests against any
security provider will be subject to certain defenses available to Guarantors or security providers, as applicable,
in the relevant jurisdiction. Although laws differ among these jurisdictions, these laws and defenses generally
include those that relate to corporate purpose or benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference,
insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, financial assistance, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization,
capital maintenance, set-off, counter-claim and prescription (time bar) or similar laws, regulations or defenses
affecting the rights of creditors generally. If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, a Guarantor
or grantor of security interests may have no liability or decreased liability under its Notes Guarantee or security
interest, as applicable, depending on the amount of its other obligations and applicable law.

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other
laws, a court could (i) subordinate or void any Notes Guarantee or any security interest (ii) direct that the holders
of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Notes Guarantee or security interest to the relevant Guarantor or
security provider, or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors or (iii) take other action that is
detrimental to you, typically if the court found that:

  - the Notes Guarantee or security interest was granted with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud
creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or the security provider or, in certain jurisdictions, even
when the recipient was merely aware that the Guarantor or the security provider was insolvent when
it granted the relevant Notes Guarantee or security;

  - the Guarantor or security provider did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for
the granting of the Notes Guarantee and/or security interest and the Guarantor or security provider: (i)
was insolvent or was rendered insolvent as a result of having granted the relevant Notes Guarantee or
security interest; (ii) was under-capitalized or became under-capitalized because of the relevant Notes
Guarantee or security interest; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness
beyond its ability to pay at maturity;

  - the granting of the relevant Notes Guarantee and/or security interest was held to constitute prohibited
financial assistance;

  - the granting of the relevant Notes Guarantee and/or security interest was held not to be in the best
interests or not to be for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor or security provider or was held to
exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or security provider; or

  - the aggregate amounts paid or payable under the relevant Notes Guarantee or enforcement proceeds
under the relevant security were in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law.

These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee granted by any of our subsidiaries pursuant to the
Indenture.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon applicable governing
law. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if:

  - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all its assets;

  - the present fair value of its assets was less than the amount required to pay its existing debts and
liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they became due; or

  - it could not pay its debts as they became due.

We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was “insolvent”
at the relevant time or that, regardless of the method of the valuation, a court would not determine that a
Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a


-----

Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Notes Guarantee was issued, that payments to holders of the Notes
constituted preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds.

The liability of each Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee, or security provider under the relevant Security
Document, will be limited to the amount that will result in such Notes Guarantee or security interest not
constituting a fraudulent preference or conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set
aside. However, there can be no assurances as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of
the maximum liability of each Guarantor or security provider. There is a possibility that the entire Notes
Guarantee or security interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished.

If a court were to find that the issuance of the Notes or a Notes Guarantee, or the granting of the security, was
a fraudulent preference or conveyance or unenforceable for any other reason, the court could hold that the
payment obligations under the Notes or such Notes Guarantee or Security Document are ineffective, could void
the security over the Collateral, or could require the holders of the relevant Notes to repay any amounts received
with respect to the Notes or such Notes Guarantee or any enforcement proceeds received from enforcement of
the security. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent preference or conveyance occurred, you may cease to
have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor or security provider and would be a creditor solely of the
Issuer, any other Guarantor or security provider, if applicable, under any Notes Guarantees or Security
Documents that have not been declared void.

Additionally, any future pledge or charge of Collateral in favor of the Security Agent, including pursuant to
Security Documents delivered after the date of the Indenture, might be avoidable by the security provider (as
debtor-in-possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy (or similar officer) if certain events or circumstances exist
or occur, including, among others, if the security provider is insolvent at the time of the pledge or charge, the
pledge or charge permits the holders of the Notes to receive a greater recovery than if the pledge or charge had
not been given and a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the security provider is commenced within a certain
time period following the pledge or charge.

###### Enforcement of the rights of the holders of the Notes under the Indenture across multiple jurisdictions may be difficult and the applicable insolvency laws may preclude holders of the Notes from recovering payments due on the Notes

The Indenture, the Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be governed by the laws of the State of New York, the
Intercreditor Agreement will be governed by the laws of England and Wales, and the Security Documents
granting security interests in the Collateral will be governed by the laws of a number of different jurisdictions.
Moreover, the Issuer and the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Sweden, Norway and Finland.
Therefore, in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in these and
other applicable jurisdictions. The rights of the holders of the Notes under the Indenture will thus be subject to
the laws of a number of jurisdictions, and it may be difficult to effectively enforce such rights in multiple
bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar proceedings. Moreover, such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are
typically complex and costly for creditors and often result in substantial uncertainty and delay in the
enforcement of creditors’ rights. In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administration and other laws of the
jurisdiction of incorporation of the Issuer and the Guarantors may be materially different from, or in conflict
with, one another, including creditors’ rights, priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and
the duration of the insolvency proceeding. The application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could
trigger disputes over which jurisdictions’ law should apply and could adversely affect the ability to realize any
recovery under the Notes.

###### Our hedging agreements may expose us to credit default risks and potential losses if our hedging counterparties fall into bankruptcy

We are party to certain interest rate swaps and we may enter into additional interest hedging agreements to
hedge our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, primarily under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes.
Under any such agreements, we are exposed to credit risks of our counterparties. If one or more of our
counterparties falls into bankruptcy, claims we have under the swap agreements or other hedging arrangements
may become worthless. Also, such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion
of the adverse financial impact resulting from interest rate or foreign currency fluctuations. In addition, in the
event that we refinance our debt or otherwise terminate hedging agreements, we may be required to make
termination payments, which would result in a loss.

###### We may not be able to obtain the funds required to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control and the occurrence of certain important corporate events will not constitute a Change of Control

The Indenture will contain provisions relating to certain events constituting a “Change of Control” (as defined
in the Indenture). Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, we will be required to offer to repurchase all
outstanding Notes at a price equal to 101 per cent. of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest
and additional amounts, if any, to the date of repurchase. If a Change of Control were to occur, we cannot assure
you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide
to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the Super Senior
Facilities, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other than existing contractual obligations would
allow us to make such required repurchases. A Change of Control may trigger a mandatory prepayment of the
Super Senior Facilities and other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could
cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer
to receive cash from its subsidiaries to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence
of a Change of Control, may be limited by our then existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be
available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a Change of Control were
to occur at a time when our Group is prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of
repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the
Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such
borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer would remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we
expect that we would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of
Control. We cannot assure you that our Group would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer
to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute
a default under the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.”

The Change of Control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the
event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar
transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift
in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a Change of Control as defined
in the Indenture. Except as described under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control,” the Indenture will
not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of
a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction.

In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of control under the
Indenture will be deemed not be a change of control if at the time our consolidated net leverage ratio is less
than certain specified levels. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the
_Notes—Certain Definitions—Specified Change of Control Event.”_

9


-----

The definition of Change of Control in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries (if any), taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a
limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established
definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of
uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the
Issuer’s assets and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a
Change of Control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the relevant
Notes.

###### The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies

Owners of the book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of relevant Notes unless and until
definitive notes are issued in exchange for book-entry interests. Instead, the common depositary (or its nominee)
for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the Notes in global form.

Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the Notes in global form will be
made to the Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, such payments
will be credited to Euroclear and Clearstream participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the Notes
in global form and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to Euroclear and
Clearstream, none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, Transfer Agent, Paying Agent, the Calculation
Agent or the Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or
payments of interest, principal or other amounts to Euroclear and Clearstream, or to owners of book-entry
interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest in the Notes, you must rely on the procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream and, if you are not a participant in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, on the procedures
of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the
Notes under the Indenture.

Owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon our solicitations for consents or requests
for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes, including the enforcement of security for the Notes and
the Notes Guarantees. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be reliant on the common depositary
(or its nominee) (as registered holder of the Notes) to act on your instructions and/or will be permitted to act
directly only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream or,
if applicable, from a participant. We cannot assure you that procedures implemented for the granting of such
proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any requested actions or to take any other action on a timely
basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until the relevant Definitive
Registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be
restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. We cannot assure you that the procedures to be
implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under
the Notes. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.”

###### There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited

We cannot assure you as to:

  - the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

  - your ability to sell your Notes; or

  - the price at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

80


-----

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing
interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for noninvestment-grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices
of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by
a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in
prices. The trading market for the Notes may attract different investors and this may affect the extent to which
the Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such
disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial
performance. As a result, there can be no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Notes. If
no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at
all.

Although an application will be made to the Authority for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on
the Official List of the Exchange, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be or remain listed. Although no
assurance can be made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of the admission to the Official List of the
Exchange, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting (whether or not for an alternative admission to
listing on another stock exchange) of the Notes from the Official List of the Exchange may have a material
effect on a holder’s ability to resell the Notes in the secondary market.

In addition, the Indenture will allow us to issue additional Notes in the future, which could adversely impact
the liquidity of the relevant Notes.

###### United States civil liabilities may not be enforceable against us

The Issuer and the Guarantors are located in Sweden, Norway and Finland and all of our assets are located
outside the United States. In addition, all of the members of our board and our officers reside outside the United
States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us
or such other persons residing outside the United States, or to enforce outside the United States judgments
obtained against such persons in United States courts in any action. In addition, it may be difficult for investors
to enforce, in original actions brought in courts in jurisdictions located outside the United States, rights
predicated upon United States laws. See “Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.”

Sweden, Norway and Finland currently do not have a treaty with the United States providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters.
This may give rise to difficulties in respect of the enforcement in Sweden, Norway and Finland of judgments
obtained in the United States. In particular, a judgment entered against a company incorporated in Sweden in
the courts of a state which is not a Member State (as defined in the Recast Brussels Regulation) or a Contracting
State (as defined in the Lugano Convention), such as the United States, would not be recognized or enforceable
in Sweden as a matter of law without a retrial. In addition, a Swedish court may choose to retry the dispute
without regard to the previous judgment. See “Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.”

###### Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The credit ratings address
our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks in determining the likelihood
that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all
risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed above and other factors that may affect
the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject
to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit
rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn
entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension,

81


-----

reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the relevant Notes by one or more of the
credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost, terms and conditions of our financings, and could adversely
affect the value and trading of the Notes.

###### Certain covenants may be suspended upon the occurrence of a change in our ratings

The Indenture will provide that, if at any time following the date of the Indenture, the Notes receive a rating of
“Baa3” or better from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) or “BBB-” or better from Standard &
Poor’s Financial Services LLC (“S&P”) or Fitch Ratings Inc. (“Fitch”) and no default or event of default has
occurred and is continuing, then beginning that day and continuing until such time that the Notes receive a
rating of below “Baa3” from Moody’s or “BBB-” from S&P or Fitch, certain covenants will cease to be
applicable to the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on
_Achievement of Investment Grade Status.” If these covenants were to cease to be applicable, we would be able_
to incur additional indebtedness or make payments, including dividends or investments, which may conflict
with the interests of holders of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve an
investment grade rating or that any such rating will be maintained.

###### The transferability of the Notes may be limited under applicable securities laws, which may affect their liquidity and the price at which they may be sold

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or the
securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the
United States, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and the applicable securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction. The
Notes are not being offered for sale in the United States except to QIBs in accordance with Rule 144A. In
addition, by acceptance of delivery of any Notes, the holder thereof agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of
any investor accounts for which it has purchased the Notes that it shall not transfer the Notes in an aggregate
principal account of less than €100,000. We have not agreed to or otherwise undertaken to register the Notes
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (including by way of an exchange offer). See “Transfer
_Restrictions.” It is the obligation of holders of the Notes to ensure that their offers and sales of the Notes within_
the United States and other countries comply with applicable securities laws.

###### Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If investors measure their investment returns by reference
to a currency other than euro, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange-related risks due to,
among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro relative to the currency by reference
to which such investors measure the return on their investments. These changes may be due to economic,
political and other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the euro against the currency by
reference to which such investors measure the return on their investments could cause a decrease in the effective
yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on the
Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which such investors measure the return on their
investments.

###### The Notes may be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes

The Notes may be issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Notes will be considered to be
issued with OID if the stated principal amount of the Notes exceeds the issue price of the Notes (as determined
for U.S. federal income tax purposes) by an amount equal to or more than a statutorily defined de minimis
amount. In such event, investors in the Notes subject to U.S. federal income taxation generally will be required
to include such OID in their gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes as it accrues, in advance of the
receipt of cash payments attributable to such income, using the constant yield method. See “Certain Tax
_Considerations—U.S. Federal Income Taxation.”_

82


-----

###### Risks Related to Our Ownership

 The interests of our principal shareholders may conflict with your interests as a holder of the Notes

The interests of our controlling shareholders may conflict with yours as a holder of the Notes, particularly if we
encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. The controlling shareholders have
(directly or indirectly) the power to, among other things, affect our legal and capital structure and our day-today operations and may have an incentive to increase the value of their investments or cause us to distribute
funds at the expense of our financial condition, which could impact our ability to make payments on the Notes.
In addition, the controlling shareholders have the power to elect a majority of our board of directors and appoint
new officers and management and, therefore, effectively control many other major decisions regarding our
operations. We cannot assure you that the interests of the controlling shareholders will not conflict with your
interests as a holder of the Notes. See “Principal Shareholder” and “Certain Relationships and Related Party
_Transactions.”_

###### USE OF PROCEEDS

To consummate the Transactions, including the Continuation Fund Transfer and the Refinancing, the Issuer (i)
used shareholder funding, comprising a €393.8 million equity contribution by its immediate parent, Apollo
Swedish Holdco AB (the “Equity Contribution”) and a €125.0 million shareholder bridge loan from Apollo
Swedish Holdco AB (the “Shareholder Bridge Loan”) to pay the Purchase Price and (ii) expects to use the
gross proceeds from the Offering, together with cash from the termination of hedging related to the Existing
Notes, to redeem the Existing Notes, repay the Shareholder Bridge Loan and pay fees and expenses relating to
the Refinancing. See “Summary—The Transactions” and “Capitalization”

The following table shows the estimated sources and uses of funds related to the Transactions. Actual amounts
may vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including, but not limited to, differences in
fees and expenses, the cost of repaying the existing debt (including accrued and unpaid interest) and currency
exchange rates.

###### MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

_The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the three months_
_ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 and the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 should be read in_
_conjunction with the Financial Statements, the notes thereto, “Presentation of Financial and Other_
_Information” and the other information included elsewhere in this offering memorandum._

_This section contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our results may differ_
_materially from those discussed in such forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including_
_those described under “Risk Factors.”_

_Selected consolidated information in this section has been derived from the Financial Statements, in each case_
_without material adjustments, unless otherwise stated, as well as our management financial reports._

###### Overview

We are one of the Nordic region’s leading providers of smart and sustainable installation and service solutions,
with our primary activities focusing on electrical engineering, heating & sanitation, ventilation and smart
buildings & automation, such as building management systems (“BMS”) and individual metering and debiting
(“IMD”), as well as key competencies in data & telecoms, industrial pipes, district heating, cooling, sprinklers,
security and green technology solutions (“GreenTech”).

We hold a strong position in the growing installation market in the Nordic countries in which we operate
(comprising Sweden, Norway and Finland), which are estimated at approximately SEK 125 billion, SEK 90
billion and SEK 66 billion, respectively, and have a combined approximate value of SEK 282 billion as of
December 31, 2022. In 2021, within the installation and service market, we were the third largest company in
the Nordic countries in which we operate (comprised of Sweden, Norway and Finland), the second largest
company in Sweden, the third largest company in Norway and the seventh largest company in Finland, in each
case based on revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 according to an independent third-party
consultant. Our multi-technical offering, market share and size have enhanced our position as a competent and
trusted partner that provides reliable and efficient high-quality services in the context of an ongoing
transformation towards a more energy-efficient and sustainable society.

We provide design, installation, maintenance and service solutions for a wide range of properties, industrial
facilities and infrastructure projects for a diverse customer base consisting of over 20,000 large and small
customers, which include construction companies, the public sector, property owners and industrial companies.
Our installation business consists of the installation of technical systems as part of the construction of new
properties and the renovation or upgrade of technical systems as part of the reconstruction and renovation of
properties, improving their functionality and comfort. Our design and maintenance capabilities complement
our installation business. Lastly, our service business consists of the operation, maintenance, repair,
replacement, reconfiguration and monitoring of technical installations in buildings, industrial plants and
infrastructure. Our strong relationships with our customers have contributed to an order backlog of SEK 9,115
million and an LTM order intake of SEK 12,836 million, respectively, as of March 31, 2023, and we currently
have over 3,000 ongoing projects as of March 31, 2023. We take on primarily two types of assignments:
contractor assignments and service assignments. The proportion of contractor assignments and service
assignments represented 58 per cent. and 42 per cent., respectively, of our net revenue for the twelve months
ended March 31, 2023.

Our operations are decentralized and governed based on a shared framework, clear allocation of roles and
responsibilities and systematic monitoring. Our current operating organization is divided into five specific

8


-----

business areas: three in Sweden (Assemblin Electrical, Assemblin H&S and Assemblin Ventilation), one in
Norway (Assemblin Norway) and one in Finland, which also includes BMS products and IMD operations in
Sweden and Norway (Assemblin Finland), comprising approximately 199 branches with approximately 6,890
FTE employees in the Nordic region as of March 31, 2023. We believe that our decentralized business model
contributes to the profitability of our operations. This decentralized and entrepreneurial business model allows
us to swiftly adjust to a largely variable cost structure and promotes enterprise and accountability at all levels
of our structure, with the president of each business area being responsible, together with their management
groups, for the operations and earnings in their respective business areas.

###### Our Segments

Our operating segments are based primarily on the main operational orientation the segments have. Our
operating segments comprise:

- _Assemblin Electrical: offers design, installation, service and maintenance of electrical systems_
(including GreenTech solutions such as solar cells and electric vehicles charging) and BMS solutions in
Sweden.

- _Assemblin H&S: offers design, installation, service and maintenance of technical systems for heating,_
sanitation, industrial pipes, heat pumps, sprinklers and district and geothermal heating in Sweden.

- _Assemblin Ventilation: offers design, construction, installation, service and maintenance of ventilation_
and cooling systems in Sweden, as well as two specialized workshops producing rectangular ventilation
ducts.

- _Assemblin Norway: offers installation and service solutions within electrical, heating and sanitation and_
ventilation solutions, mainly in the greater Oslo area and surrounding regions.

- _Assemblin Finland: offers technical installation and service solutions within the technical disciplines_
electrical, heating and sanitation, ventilation, cooling, energy efficiency, IMD, geothermal and heat
pumps and BMS solutions (including products) in Finland as well as in Sweden and Norway for BMS
products and IMD.

This division into segments is the primary division that our management observes as regards earnings, capital
requirements and cash flows.

###### Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations

 General Economic Conditions and Activity in the Installation Market

Macroeconomic conditions and GDP fluctuations in Sweden, Norway and Finland, the geographic markets in
which we operate, affect customer demand and, in turn, our results of operations. During periods of strong GDP
growth, our activity benefits from increased demand from both the private and public sectors, which has a
positive impact on our order intake and backlog. Recessionary periods affect our activities differently. During
a downturn, our installation business typically experiences a decline in net revenue resulting from reduced
levels of capital investments by our customers. This includes reduced spending by national and local authorities,
as well as industrial and utility companies, although public sector expenditure tends to decrease less relative to
private sector spending. However, we usually have the opportunity to adopt appropriate and pre-emptive
measures to adjust our cost base and protect our margins, as installation is one of the last steps in the cycle of a
construction project. In contrast to the more cyclical installation business, our service business provides a stable
source of income during recessionary periods, as demand in our service business, which is mainly driven by
renovation and maintenance expenditures, has been generally resilient to macroeconomic changes and is in

88


-----

many cases countercyclical, providing a more stable source of income. When macroeconomic conditions
improve, we generally experience increases in revenues in both our installation business and our service
business, as well as increased order flow.

During the 2020 and 2021 periods, macroeconomic conditions remained generally stable, with high activity
levels in the installation market. Housing construction slowed down in the metropolitan regions, which was
however offset by increased public investments in primarily major infrastructure projects, hospitals and schools.
The macroeconomic environment in Europe has deteriorated quickly since the second quarter of 2022. The
Russian invasion of Ukraine in February of 2022 fueled inflation through the economy, caused a general rise in
interest rates from central banks and has put into doubt Western Europe’s energy supply, particularly in countries
that are dependent on imported fossil fuels, all leading to an environment of uncertainty that could have an
effect on the construction industry in the countries where we operate. We have experienced higher costs of
production, along with the handling of delayed deliveries, as a result of rising inflation, higher energy prices
and supply chain disruptions caused by the geopolitical situation in Europe. Higher interest rates also make it
more difficult for our customers to secure financing for new construction projects. Despite these factors, the
level of activity in the installation market was high in 2022. Although housing starts construction in the larger
cities decreased, high energy prices boosted interest in green technology and energy efficiency measures. We
also experienced higher demand from public customers as well as for solutions for intelligent buildings and
security technology, which contributed to our strong order intake in 2022, despite the increased uncertainty.
Additionally, due to our ability to transfer price increases to customers, the price of our services offered has
offset inflation in recent quarter, resulting in stable margins and double digit organic growth. If these factors
continue, however, and spark a deep and prolonged recession in the markets in which we operate, this can have
a negative impact on our results of operation.

###### COVID-19

While the COVID-19 pandemic had a material impact on businesses around the world, our results of operations
and EBITA Margins remained relatively resilient through the affected periods and to date. The pandemic had a
negative impact on our business, primarily in relation to our operational efficiency when performing our
services. This was due to several factors, including restricted access for our staff to certain sites and buildings
following the closure of certain production sites such as industrial facilities, increased sick leave among our
employees, a need for us to increase health and safety measures throughout our operations and decreased access
to qualified labor due to closure of borders and decreased labor mobility. The general uncertainty created by the
pandemic also resulted in the delay of some planned renovations and maintenance upgrades. However, despite
these disruptions, we performed relatively well during the pandemic as we were generally able to continue
working on our ongoing projects and providing our services.

Despite the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for our offering increased due to the
greater availability of capital, as additional investments were deployed in the housing, hospital and
infrastructure segments following a period of decrease in 2020.

###### Order Intake and Backlog Development

Our order intake for the first quarter of 2023 totals SEK 3,213 million (a decrease of SEK 331 million, or 9.3
per cent, compared to the first quarter of 2022). The lower order intake in the first quarter 2023 is mainly
explained by a lower share of larger projects in the specific quarter. We believe that the underlying drivers for
long-term growth remain intact, and that we benefit from being a large, stable player with a decentralized
business model and the ability to identify and react quickly to market changes. In recent quarters order intake
growth is driven by service growth returning after the COVID-19 pandemic and we are yet to see the full impact
of inflation translate to order intake through indexing and cost-plus change orders.

89


-----

###### Active Portfolio Management

We aim to grow sustainably the number of high-margin projects for our installation and service businesses, with
a diversified customer base in a wide range of end-markets. When one of our end-markets is experiencing lower
capital investments, we may benefit from spending in another end-market. For example, hospitals are generally
not impacted by the business cycle while industrial customers are more exposed. We also actively reallocate
resources in response to varying demand in our geographical regions. Our installation business order book
provides sales visibility and allows active project portfolio management. We actively monitor our order intake
and order backlog. Order intake represents the value of projects received during any relevant period, plus
changes to existing projects made during that period. Order backlog represents the production value in all
projects that is remaining and not yet accrued.

We have a strong focus on operational excellence and a corporate culture focused on profitability over volume.
We believe that implementation of systematic project selection and process management measures are
important factors to deliver continued margin improvement.

###### Our Cost Structure and Operational Improvement Programs

We have a flexible cost structure, which helps to preserve margins during economic downturns. Variable and
semi-variable costs (including subcontracting costs, salaries for temporary and fixed-term employees and
installation materials, tools, equipment and consumables used) constituted approximately 89 per cent of our
cost base, during the twelve months ended March 31, 2023. We maintain low levels of inventory and our
suppliers deliver directly to our work sites, which helps reduce our fixed costs and allows us to adjust our cost
structure in response to market demand. In less successful branches we can rapidly adjust our cost base as we
reduce low margin volumes, as we have recently done in Finland. Even in more successful branches,
fluctuations in local markets mean that we are continually resizing our cost base to maintain overall margins.
Since 2020, owing to the improving quality of our branch network, we have not had any comprehensive
restructuring programs although we have reorganized a handful of branches each year as part of our ordinary
course of business.

###### Cash Conversion Trends

Cash conversion is typically above 100 per cent. but fluctuates depending on the revenue mix, with the higher
margin service and GreenTech businesses also requiring higher working capital, driving lower cash conversion.
In addition, projects typically carry negative working capital for most of the production time but move to
positive working capital towards the end of the project’s production cycle, meaning a period of higher order
intake than revenue typically drives an increase of working capital. In recent quarters, we have seen an increase
in working capital driven by the uncertainty in component supply chains combined with strong production
driving a build-up in buffer inventory and pre-deliveries to maintain production efficiency.

We are continually focusing on improving net working capital, especially in successful, acquired businesses
that have a less ingrained cash culture in relation to the rest of the Group.

###### Seasonality

Our revenues and costs are subject to seasonal variation, limiting the overall comparability of interim financial
periods. The third quarter is typically the weakest quarter of the year in terms of revenue, margins and cash
flow generation due to the summer holidays. The first quarter of the year typically generates lower revenue and
margins due to lower production work due to winter weather, holidays (new year and, from time to time, Easter)
as well as the calendar effect whereby a greater number of projects close in the fourth quarter of the previous
year. Relatedly, the fourth quarter typically represents the strongest and most profitable quarter due to favorable
calendar effect due to a greater number of projects closing by the end of the year. We account for revenue in
accordance with the degree of completion of the project. Therefore, when a public holiday falls in a given

90


-----

interim period, there are fewer working days and as a result we recognize less revenue from our ongoing
projects.

Our working capital needs are seasonal, although they are generally negative due to our customer contracts and
focus on invoice collection. We invoice our customers regularly, in the case of ongoing and completed
installation and service projects. Cash flow tends to be generally the strongest in the fourth quarter with public
and private sector customers seeking to meet their maintenance and operating expenses budgets but also due to
many projects being completed in this quarter before the year-end and onset of winter. Cash flow in August and
September tends to be relatively weaker because of lower business activity in the month of July and August,
which is the main annual holiday period in our markets.

We have experienced seasonally strong cash flows during the three months ended March 31, 2023, which have
been positively affected by the seasonal improvement in net working capital typical for the first quarter,
although somewhat less marked than the first quarter of 2022. Moreover, to date, we have not experienced any
significant delays in the payment of invoices by our customers. However, we have experienced several factors
in recent quarters that have increased our working capital requirements including: (i) increased share of revenue
mix for capital intensive services and GreenTech business; (ii) requirements to purchase materials and
components ahead of payment schedules to secure production increasing revenue recognized and not invoiced
as well as inventories; and (iii) changes in the project revenue mix as a lower share of larger projects in recent
order intake and increased cost-plus projects affect working capital negatively. We will likely experience a
further increase in working capital needs if the markets in which we operate are subject to significant
recessionary periods due to the current macroeconomic environment. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
_Business and Industry—Amounts included in our estimated order backlog may not result in actual revenue or_
_translate into profits, and our estimated order backlog is subject to delays, customer bankruptcy, accounting_
_errors and unexpected adjustments and is therefore an uncertain indicator of future results of operations.”_
Increased demand in our service business, which tends to be countercyclical, typically result in more working
capital outflows, as compared to our installation projects.

###### Foreign Currency Exchange Rates

Our reported results of operations and financial condition are affected by exchange rate fluctuations due to both
transactional and translational exposure. Our business operations are characterized by a relatively low level of
transactional currency risk since our purchases and sales are typically made in the same local currency with
minimal exposure to imported components. However, we are exposed to risks relating to translation into
Swedish kronor of income statements and balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries with local reporting
denominated in euro (in the case of operations in Finland) and Norwegian kroner.

_Transactional risk: Transactional risk arises when our subsidiaries execute transactions in a currency other than_
their functional currency. Transactions in foreign currency are restated in the functional currency at the
exchange rate in effect on the transaction date. Functional currency is the currency in which the primary
financial environments where the companies conduct their operations. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign
currency are restated in the functional currency at the exchange rate in effect on the balance-sheet date.
Exchange rate differences arising in the restatements are recognized in profit or loss for the year. Non-monetary
assets and liabilities recognized at historical cost are restated at the exchange rate on the transaction date. Nonmonetary assets and liabilities recognized at fair value are restated in the functional currency at the exchange
rate in effect on the date of measurement at fair value. We generally benefit from a natural hedge against
currency fluctuations in the three countries in which we operate because we incur costs and receive revenues in
the applicable local currency. However, we purchase equipment from suppliers who generally operate in euro,
and these suppliers may change their Swedish krona or Norwegian krone prices to reflect fluctuations in the
Swedish krona or Norwegian krone to euro exchange rate.

91


-----

_Financial reports from operations abroad: Assets and liabilities in operations abroad, including goodwill and_
other Group-related surpluses and deficits, are restated from the functional currency of the operations abroad
in the Group’s reporting currency at the exchange rate in effect on the balance-sheet date. Long-term loans to
subsidiaries designated by the parent as part of its net investment in foreign operations are treated as equity for
translational purposes with the differences being recognized in other comprehensive income. Revenue and
expenses in operations abroad are restated in Swedish kronor at an average rate that constituted an
approximation of the exchange rates that were in effect on the respective transaction dates. Translation
differences arising in connection with currency restatements are recognized in Other comprehensive income,
and are accumulated in a separate component in equity, designated as translation reserves. In the event the
operations abroad are not wholly owned, the translation difference is allocated to holdings with a noncontrolling interest based on its proportional ownership share. When controlling interest, significant interest or
joint controlling interest for operations abroad are dissolved, the accumulated translation differences
attributable to the operations are realized, at which point they are reclassified from the translation reserves in
equity to profit or loss for the year. In the event a sale occurs but controlling interest remains, a proportional
share of accumulated translation differences from the translation reserve is transferred to holdings with a noncontrolling interest. In the event of a sale of portions of associates and joint ventures where significant interest
or joint controlling interest remains, a proportional share of the translation differences are reclassified to profit
or loss for the year.

We did not experience significant gains or losses as a result of fluctuations of Norwegian kroner and the euro
against Swedish kronor during the periods under review, other than the exchange rate loss on the unsecured
portion of our bond notes.

###### Personnel Costs and Availability of Skilled Personnel

For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, we had personnel costs of SEK 4,071 million, SEK
4,218 million and SEK 4,858 million, respectively, which accounted for 42.8 per cent., 41.6 per cent. and 38.3
per cent., respectively of our total operating expenses (which includes costs of production and selling and
administrative expenses) of SEK 9,503 million, SEK 10,148 million and SEK 12,686 million for the years
ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively. While several of our project assignment contracts
include indexation provisions for wage increases which allow us to pass increases of costs on to our customers,
increases in personnel costs can have a material impact on our result of operations. As almost all of our labor
force is subject to collective bargaining agreements, wages are generally subject to annual increases determined
by the labor unions in accordance with the collective bargaining agreements. Between 2020 and 2022, our
personnel costs have increased by 19.3 per cent., driven by an increased number of skilled personnel and wage
increases. In addition, our growth can at times be constrained by our ability to find skilled labor force necessary
to complete our installation projects or perform service assignments. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
_Business and Industry—Our success is highly dependent on the ability to recruit and retain technical and other_
_key personnel.”_

###### Equipment and Materials Used

We purchase equipment (machinery, technical equipment and installation equipment) and installation materials
in the ordinary course of our business. Our expenses for this equipment and these materials are subject to
fluctuations based on our activity levels and the prices of the equipment and materials we purchase. During
periods of strong economic growth, our expenditures on equipment and other materials are higher, due to the
fact that our installation business, which requires more purchases of materials, makes up a larger share of our
total sales than is the case during recessionary periods. We continually seek to consolidate our purchases to
achieve volume-based discounts from our suppliers. During economic downturns, when our service business
makes up a larger share of our total sales than our installation business, our expenditures on equipment and
other materials are lower, due to the fact that maintenance services require the use of less equipment and

92


-----

materials. The prices of the equipment we purchase are subject to variation based on the fluctuations in the
prices of raw materials (primarily aluminium, copper and steel) used to produce that equipment. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Fluctuating commodity prices, including as a result of_
_geographical conflict or macroeconomic factors, may adversely impact our results of operations.”_

###### Acquisitions

In recent years, external growth has contributed to the overall growth of our business, and we intend to continue
to pursue acquisitions to increase our market presence, our service offering and our service capacity. Since
January 1, 2020, we have completed the acquisition of an additional 55 companies in Sweden, Norway and
Finland, and across each of our business areas, with estimated aggregated annual sales of over SEK 3 billion,
including 17 in Assemblin Electrical, 14 in Assemblin H&S, 6 in Assemblin Ventilation, 9 in Assemblin Finland
and 9 in Assemblin Norway. Of these acquisitions, 9 were completed in Norway (with estimated aggregate
annual sales of SEK 428 million), 38 acquisitions were completed in Sweden (with estimated aggregate annual
sales of SEK 1,680 billion) and 8 acquisitions were completed in Finland (with estimated aggregate annual
sales of SEK 1,064 billion).

In the three months ended March 31, 2023, we completed 5 small “bolt-on” acquisitions in Sweden and Norway
across several of our business areas, including; Assemblin Electrical (RA Vision AB), Assemblin H&S
(Enexergi AB) and Assemblin Norway (electrical business MV Elektro, ventilation business Drammen
Ventilasjon and heating & sanitation business Ariemi). These companies have a total of over 250 employees
and estimated aggregated annual revenues of SEK 347 million. These acquisitions were made with cash on
balance sheet. Additional variable cash consideration of up to SEK 526 million was payable over the next three
years as of March 31, 2023. See Note 4 to the Unaudited Consolidated Condensed Interim Financial Statements.
In addition, since April 1, 2023, we have completed an additional 3 small “bolt-on” acquisitions, one in
Assemblin Electrical (Elia AB) and two in Assemblin Norway (electrical company Fjorden Elektro AS and
ventilation company Ingeniørfirmaet R. Torgersen AS). These companies have a total of approximately 100
employees and estimated aggregated annual revenues of SEK 290 million. The acquisitions completed after
March 31, 2023 and were made with cash on balance sheet.

Excluding the asset purchase transactions (Ohlssons Rör, Secer, Drammen Ventilasjon and MV Elektro), we
estimate, based on each company’s historical EBITDA derived from its management accounts, as adjusted in a
manner consistent with the adjustments applied to our Adjusted EBITDA, to the extent applicable, and as further
adjusted for the application of our accounting policies and other items, that the acquisitions completed during
the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, would have a positive EBITDA impact of SEK 51 million for the
same period, if each of the acquisitions was completed on April 1, 2022.

We have been successful in integrating acquired businesses in the past and have achieved meaningful synergies
that have resulted in increased EBITA Margins and profitability. We focus on realizing synergies from (i)
procurement savings resulting from having the acquired business purchase installation material, tools and
equipment under our purchase agreements with our suppliers, which provide for better commercial terms,
compared to the existing supply contracts of the acquired business, (ii) sharing our best practice with the
acquired business, or the acquired business’ best practice with the rest of our Group, resulting in improved
profitability and (iii) the acquired business benefitting from our specialists in areas such as design and tender
process, legal, procurement, human resources (“HR”) and communication. We typically realizes these synergies
over a certain period of time after the acquisition, and not immediately, to ensure compatibility with the
established processes in usually already well-run businesses. Non- recurring costs related to these acquisitions
are discussed under “—Items Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations” below.

93

###### Items Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations

Items affecting comparability are categorized as acquisition, integration and start-up costs, restructuring costs,
transformation costs and other adjustments. These items, which are discussed below, do not occur regularly and
affect comparability between periods both, year over year and quarter over quarter. We believe it is important
to clearly distinguish how these items affect each period and therefore show adjusted performance measures.
The items affecting comparability are also consistent with how management reviews and evaluates the business
and consequently the information is also included in the operating segments’ disclosures in notes to the
Financial Statements.

The table below sets out the categories of items affecting comparability of our results of operations during
periods under review:

###### Description of Key Line Items

Set forth below is a brief description of our key income statement line items.

_Net revenue consist primarily of revenue from construction contracts and service assignments._

- For our construction contracts, revenue from ongoing contracts is recognized over time on the basis of
assignment expenditures incurred in relation to the total estimated assignment fees of the assignment.
Costs associated with this are recognized in earnings as they arise. Revenue is based on a contractual
fixed price or for IPD contracts on a pre-agreed threshold where the margin added changes. Changes in
the scope of the assignment, claims and incentive remuneration are included in project revenue to the
extent that they are agreed upon with the customer and can be reliably measured. A fundamental
condition for reporting revenue over time is that the course of events can reasonably be measured against
completion of the performance obligation. For projects in which the outcome of a performance
obligation cannot reasonably be measured, but coverage is expected for the expenditures that arise from
completing the performance obligation, only revenue for expenditures incurred up until the result of the
performance obligation can reasonably be measured is reported.

-----

- For our service assignments, revenue and the appurtenant costs are recognized over time (meaning, in
pace with the service being provided to the customer). Measurement of the course of events is established
on the basis of assignment expenditures incurred in relation to the total estimated assignment
expenditures.

For further information on our revenue recognition policy, see Note 1 to the Audited Consolidated Financial
Statements.

_Cost for production primarily consist of (i) personnel costs, including wages, bonuses and social security costs,_
(ii) raw materials and consumables costs, (iii) subcontractors and purchased services costs, and (iv) premises
directly linked to production, such as warehouses or workshops. In the year ended December 31, 2022 and the
three months ended March 31, 2023, personnel costs accounted for the largest proportion of cost for production.

_Sales and administrative expenses_ primarily consist of personnel expenses in connection with the general
management of our business, including wages, bonuses and social security costs, rental costs for our premises
and other overhead costs as well as non-billable white-collar time.

_Financial income consists of interest income on invested funds, dividend income, and gains on changes in value_
of financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss. Dividend income is recognized when the right
to receive dividends has been established.

_Financial expenses_ consist of interest charged on loans, and the effect of unwinding the present value of
provisions, as well as negative foreign exchange fluctuations on unhedged debt.

_Net financial items consist of net financial income and expense and net foreign exchange gains and foreign_
exchange losses.

_Tax consists of current tax (comprising income taxes in each country where we operate) and deferred tax._

###### Net revenue

Net revenue increased by SEK 568 million, or 18.4 per cent., from SEK 3,086 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2022 to SEK 3,654 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, driven primarily by
strong organic growth further fueled by inflationary increases in the cost of goods and services passed-through
to our customers and, to a lesser extent, by bolt-on acquisitions and currency translational tailwinds.

###### Assemblin Electrical Segment

Net revenue of the Assemblin Electrical segment increased by 20.9 per cent., from SEK 1,097 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2022 to SEK 1,326 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, driven
primarily by strong organic growth in both projects and services. Order intake decreased from SEK 1,126
million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to SEK 1,090 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2023. As of March 31, 2023, order backlog amounted to SEK 2,975 million compared to SEK 3,207
million as of March 31, 2022.

###### Assemblin H&S Segment

months ended March 31, 2022 to SEK 904 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, driven primarily
by strong organic growth including inflationary increases in the cost of goods and services passed-through to
our customers and acquisitions. Order intake decreased from SEK 974 million for the three months ended March
31, 2022 to SEK 847 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, driven primarily by mainly smaller
projects and service, but also by a few larger orders being closed in the individual quarter. Order backlog as of
March 31, 2023 slightly decreased to SEK 2,070 million, compared to SEK 2,075 million as of March 31, 2022.

###### Assemblin Ventilation Segment

Net revenue of the Assemblin Ventilation segment increased by 7.5 per cent., from SEK 373 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2022 to SEK 401 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, driven
primarily by projects, coupled with service recovering after a slower first quarter in 2022. Order intake increased
from SEK 338 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 to SEK 436 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2023, driven primarily by continued demand with a slight increase in mid-sized projects.
Order backlog as of March 31, 2023 decreased to SEK 1,522 million, compared to SEK 1,637 million as of
March 31, 2022.

###### Assemblin Norway Segment

Net revenue of the Assemblin Norway segment increased by 8.8 per cent., from SEK 480 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2022 to SEK 522 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, driven primarily
by continued growth in virtually all areas, partly offset by negative currency translational effects as the NOK
decreased in relation to the SEK. Order intake decreased from SEK 634 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2022 compared to SEK 445 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 wholly driven by

fluctuations in projects order intake between quarters. Order backlog as of March 31, 2023 decreased to SEK
1,581 million, compared to SEK 2,099 million as of March 31, 2022.

###### Assemblin Finland Segment

Net revenue of the Assemblin Finland segment increased by 45.3 per cent., from SEK 384 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2022 to SEK 558 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, driven by strong
organic growth in GreenTech and positive currency translational effects. Order intake decreased from SEK 472
million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to SEK 396 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2023. Order backlog as of March 31, 2023 increased to SEK 967 million from SEK 904 million as
of March 31, 2022

###### Cost for production

Cost for production increased by SEK 415 million, or 16.7 per cent., from SEK 2,480 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2022 to SEK 2,895 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, driven by
revenue activity increasing and inflation on materials and increased subcontractor costs to manage production
increases.

###### Sales and administrative expenses

Sales and administrative expenses increased by SEK 72 million, or 15.4 per cent. from SEK 469 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2022 to SEK 541 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, driven by
inflation on personnel and premises, as well as growth in selling, general and administrative intensive service
and GreenTech units

###### Operating profit

Operating profit increased by SEK 81 million, or 58.7 per cent., from SEK 138 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2022 to SEK 219 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, driven by revenue
growth and the pass through of inflationary increases in the price of goods and services as well as growth in
higher margin businesses, such as services and GreenTech.

###### Net financial items

Net financial items decreased by SEK 20 million, or 24.4 per cent., from negative SEK 82 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2022 to negative SEK 102 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The
decrease in net financial items was attributable to exchange rate losses on the portion of the bond loan that is
not currency hedged.

###### Income taxes

Income taxes amounted to SEK 11 million and SEK 29 million in the three months ended March 30, 2022 and
2023, respectively, corresponding to 19.6 per cent. and 24.8 per cent. of profit before tax of SEK 56 million and
SEK 117 million for the respective periods.

###### Profit for the period

Profit for the period significantly increased by SEK 44 million, or 100 per cent., from SEK 44 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2022 to SEK 88 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as a result
of the factors described above.

###### Adjusted EBITA and margins

Our Adjusted EBITA for the period increased from SEK 177 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022
to SEK 241 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, which is an increase of 36.2 per cent., while
Adjusted EBITA Margin was 5.7 per cent. and 6.6 per cent. in the respective periods. The expansion in margin
was seen in most of our business areas, especially in Assemblin Finland and Assemblin Electrical.

Adjusted EBITA for the Assemblin Electrical segment increased by 32.9 per cent. from SEK 76 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2022 to SEK 101 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, while the
Adjusted EBITA Margin was 6.9 per cent. and 7.6 per cent. in the respective periods, primarily driven by strong
revenue growth driving operating leverage and improvements in the branch network.

For the Assemblin H&S segment, Adjusted EBITA increased by 10.9 per cent. from SEK 55 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2022 to SEK 61 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, while the
Adjusted EBITA Margin decreased slightly from 6.9 per cent. to 6.8 per cent. over the same period.

Adjusted EBITA for the Assemblin Ventilation segment increased by 15.8 per cent. from SEK 19 million for
the three months ended March 31, 2022 to SEK 22 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, while
Adjusted EBITA Margin also improved from 5.2 per cent. to 5.4 per cent. over the same period. The difference
year-on-year is attributable primarily to growth in service.

In the Assemblin Norway segment, Adjusted EBITA increased by 26.9 per cent. from SEK 26 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2022 to SEK 33 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, while
Adjusted EBITA Margin also improved from 5.5 per cent. to 6.2 per cent. over the same period. The difference
year-on-year is attributable to improvements in operational performance and many successful late-stage
projects.

In the Assemblin Finland segment, Adjusted EBITA increased from negative SEK 3 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2022 to SEK 24 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, while Adjusted EBITA
Margin also improved from negative 0.7 per cent. to 4.2 per cent. over the same period. Strong growth in
revenue and margins the GreenTech businesses was partly offset by restructuring in a handful of project
branches.

December 31, 2021 to SEK 13,521 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Of the total growth, 12.6 per
cent. is attributable to organic growth and the remainder was due to acquisition growth (12.2 per cent.) and to
currency effects growth (1.3 per cent.). Organic growth was driven primarily by services resuming after the
COVID-19 pandemic, a decrease in the headwinds from restructuring experienced in 2021 and the pass through
of inflationary increases in the price of goods and services. Net revenue from service assignments and contractor
assignment operations increased by 27.8 per cent. to SEK 5,616 million from SEK 4,394 million and 25.0 per

year ended December 31, 2021 to negative SEK 367 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The change
in net financial items and other financial expenses was mainly attributable to unrealized exchange rate losses
on the portion of the bond loan that is not currency hedged.

###### Income taxes

Income taxes amounted to SEK 82 million and SEK 132 million in the years ended December 31, 2021 and
2022, respectively, corresponding to 20.2 per cent. and 25.3 per cent. of profit before tax of SEK 405 million

###### Adjusted EBITA and margins

Our Adjusted EBITA for the period increased from SEK 758 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to
SEK 940 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, which is an increase of 24.0 per cent., while Adjusted
EBITA Margin was 7.1 per cent. and 7.0 per cent. in the respective periods. Earnings and profitability for the
period improved in all business areas except Assemblin Finland, which experienced both a weak start and a
weak end to the year. Measures to enhance profitability have been initiated to reverse the trend.

Adjusted EBITA for the Assemblin Electrical segment increased by 31.4 per cent. from SEK 264 million for
the year ended December 31, 2021 to SEK 347 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, driven by
previously implemented profitability improvements and profitable acquisitions, while the Adjusted EBITA
Margin also improved from 6.5 per cent. to 7.1 per cent. over the same period.

For the Assemblin H&S segment, Adjusted EBITA increased by 13.8 per cent. from SEK 225 million for the
year ended December 31, 2021 to SEK 256 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, partly due to
measures taken to enhance profitability and party due to the profitability of our acquired operations in this
segment, while the Adjusted EBITA Margin also improved from 7.6 per cent. to 7.8 per cent. over the same
period.

year ended December 31, 2021 to SEK 170 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, due to continued
strong growth, while Adjusted EBITA Margin stayed flat at 8.3 per cent. over the same period.

Adjusted EBITA for the Assemblin Finland segment decreased by 24.5 per cent. from SEK 49 million for the
year ended December 31, 2021 to SEK 37 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 mainly due to parts
of our Finnish operations being hit hard by the purchasing-related problems, combined with a number of project
write-downs towards the end of the year, while the Adjusted EBITA Margin decreased from 5.6 per cent. and
1.9 per cent. over the same period.

Notes:

(1) Sales in the Assemblin Electrical, Assemblin H&S, and Assemblin Ventilation segments add up to revenues in Sweden.

(2) Operating costs, excluding amortization and impairment of intangible assets and items affecting comparability.

(3) Items affecting comparability are included in sales and administration expenses in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. The items are attributable to acquisitions and integration expenses as well as to other items
affecting comparability.

(4) EBITA, Adjusted EBITA and Adjusted EBITA Margin are non-IFRS measures. We define EBITA as profit for the year/period excluding income taxes, net financial items and amortization of intangible assets. We define
Adjusted EBITA as EBITA adjusted for items affecting comparability as described above. We define Adjusted EBITA Margin as Adjusted EBITA divided by net revenue for the period, expressed as a percentage. EBITA
and Adjusted EBITA of individual segments are presented before intragroup eliminations. Please see “Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information” and the F-pages for details and reconciliation to the nearest
IFRS measure.

For the Assemblin H&S segment, Adjusted EBITA increased by 32.4 per cent. from SEK 170 million for the
year ended December 31, 2020 to SEK 225 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 partly due to
measures taken to enhance profitability and party due to the profitability of our acquired operations in this
segment, while the Adjusted EBITA Margin also improved from 6.4 per cent. to 7.6 per cent. over the same
period.

Adjusted EBITA for the Assemblin Ventilation segment increased by 6.3 per cent. from SEK 80 million for the
year ended December 31, 2020 to SEK 85 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, while the Adjusted

increasing by 1,533.3 per cent. from SEK 3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to SEK 49 million
for the year ended December 31, 2021, almost wholly due to the large and profitable acquisitions completed

###### Liquidity and Capital Resources

“Liquidity” describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flow to meet the cash requirements of
its business operations, including but not limited to working capital needs, capital expenditures, debt service
obligations, contractual obligations and acquisitions. Our primary uses of liquidity are to meet our debt service
obligations, to fund capital expenditures and selected bolt-on acquisitions and to fund changes in working capital.
Our primary sources of liquidity are provided by cash generated from our operating activities, our leasing
facilities which we utilize primarily to fund vehicle purchases, and further supplemented by amounts drawn
under the Revolving Credit Facility. We expect to draw on the Revolving Credit Facility to service our working
capital needs and for other general corporate purposes. Borrowings and availability under the Revolving Credit
Facility will be subject to certain conditions precedent, including compliance with financial maintenance and
other covenants and representations and warranties. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—The
_Super Senior Facilities.”_

Although we believe that our expected cash flow from operating activities will be adequate to meet our expected
liquidity needs, including our debt service obligations, we cannot assure you that our business will generate
sufficient cash flow from operations to meet these needs or that future debt or equity financing will be available
to us in an amount sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including making payments on the Notes or on our
other debt when due. If our cash flow from operating activities is lower than expected, we may be required to
seek additional financing, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Our ability to
arrange financing generally and our cost of capital depend on numerous factors, including general economic
conditions, the availability of credit from banks, other financial institutions and capital markets, restrictions in
the instruments governing our debt and our general financial performance. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to
_Our Financial Profile—Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations may make it difficult for us to_
_fulfill our obligations under the Notes and operate our business”_ and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
_Financial Profile—We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, including due to_
_factors outside our control, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our_
_indebtedness, which may not be successful.”_

Cash outflow from investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased by SEK 238 million,
from an outflow of SEK 45 million for the three months ended March 21, 2022 to an outflow of SEK 283 million
for the three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily due to acquisitions.

Cash outflow from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased by SEK 1,169 million,
from an outflow of SEK 1,538 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to an outflow of SEK 369 million
for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the smaller size of acquisitions made in the period.

Cash outflow from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by SEK 1,230 million,
from an outflow of SEK 308 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to an outflow of SEK 1,538 million
for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to larger acquisitions, especially the acquisitions of Fidelix
and Tom Allen Senera.

###### Cash Flow from Financing Activities

Cash flow from financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 were an outflow of
SEK 60 million and SEK 54 million, respectively, primarily due to repayments on leases.

Cash flow from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was an outflow of SEK 220 million,
primarily due to repayments on leases.

Cash flow from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was an inflow of SEK 839 million,
primarily due to new financing from additional bond issuance and shareholder contributions.

Cash flow from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was an outflow of SEK 188 million,
primarily due to repayments on leases.

###### Capital Expenditures and Finance Leases

We define Net Capital Expenditures as investments in intangible and tangible fixed assets, less the sales value
(cash proceeds) of tangible and intangible fixed assets for the period, and including net leasing expenditures
related to vehicles, which primarily relate to our car fleet. See “Presentation of Financial and Other
_Information—Presentation of Financial Information—Non-IFRS Measures” and “Summary—Summary_
_Consolidated Financial and Other Information—Operating Data and Non-IFRS Financial Information.” We_
define “sales value” to be disposal of property, plant and equipment in the cash flow statement, “investments in
intangible fixed assets” to be acquisitions of intangible assets in the cash flow statement and “investments in
tangible fixed assets” to be acquisitions of property, plant and equipment in the cash flow statement. Total Net

113


-----

Capital Expenditure amounted to SEK 195 million, SEK 210 million and SEK 294 million in the years ended
December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively, and SEK 59 million and SEK 109 million in the three months
ended March 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively.

Most of our total Net Capital Expenditures (SEK 195 million, SEK 210 million and SEK 294 million for the
fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively, SEK 59 million and SEK 109 million for
the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively) is related to our vehicle leases, which we finance
using finance lease facilities with local banks. Excluding capital expenditures related to vehicle leases, our
operations require very limited capital expenditure, primarily comprising expenditures on tools, refurbishment
and IT. Net Capital Expenditures before vehicle leases amounted to SEK 8 million, SEK 14 million and SEK 31
million in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively, and SEK 9 million and SEK 14
million in the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively.

###### Working Capital Requirements

We do not currently have significant short-term or long-term working capital requirements, because we typically
receive payments under our installation contracts prior to paying costs related thereto. These prepayment
arrangements, along with personnel-related costs (primarily vacation salary), result in our negative working
capital position for installation projects. In our services contracts, Net Working Capital requirements are
generally positive, as these rely less on subcontractors and materials purchased, and feature higher costs related
to our own personnel. Customer invoices are typically not drawn until work has been completed.

Our working capital requirements are also seasonal. See “—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—
_Seasonality.”_

###### Pensions obligations

Some of our white-collar employees in Sweden are covered by a defined benefit pension plan, which is accounted
for in accordance with IAS 19 under which we are required to provide agreed benefits to current and former
employees. Other employees have pensions that are recognized as defined-contribution.

As of December 31, 2022, approximately 29 per cent. of our employees had defined benefit pensions. Of these,
the Swedish plan for electricity white-collar employees is recognized as defined-benefit for purposes of our
financial statements, and is unfunded and based on final salary, which provides employees with benefits in the
form of a guaranteed level of pension disbursements over their lifetimes. For the remaining white-collar
employees in Sweden the defined-benefit pension obligations are secured through insurance with Alecta. Alecta
does not provide access to information that would make it possible for us to recognize this plan as a definedbenefit plan. The pension plan secured through insurance with Alecta is therefore recognized as a definedcontribution plan. Annual fees for pension insurance contracted with Alecta totaled SEK 74.2 million, SEK 68.8
million and SEK 59.3 million, in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Alecta’s
surplus can be allocated to policy holders and/or the insured.

Pension scheme liabilities vary with changes to long-term interest rates, inflation, pensionable salaries and the
longevity of scheme members. During the periods under review, liabilities in respect of provisions for pensions
increased from SEK 746 million as of December 31, 2020, to SEK 788 million as of December 31, 2021, but
reduced to SEK 548 million as of December 31, 2022 before increasing to SEK 596 million as of March 31,
2023, with changes driven primarily by a decline in market interest rates in 2020 and 2021, followed by increases
in 2022 and 2023, which resulted in the assumed discount rate for defined-benefit obligations increasing from
1.10 per cent. as of December 31, 2020 to 1.80 per cent. as of December 31, 2021 before increasing to 4.00 per
cent. as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023, respectively. The increases from time to time in liabilities in
respect of provisions for pensions also reflects the relatively greater proportion of plan participants that are not
eligible for retirement, as compared to the number of former plan participants that have retired.

See Note 8 to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further information as to our pensions
obligations and pensions costs.

In accordance with the requirements of the pension administrator, we are required to provide bank guarantees in
respect of a portion of the Group’s defined-benefit pensions obligations. We have been required to increase the
amount of our current SEK 375 million bank guarantee (of which SEK 285 million is incurred under the Pension
Guarantee Facility and SEK 90 million is incurred under the Guarantee Facility). Our obligations with respect to
(i) the Pension Guarantee Facility are secured on the Collateral on a super super senior basis to the Notes and (ii)
the Guarantee Facility are secured on the Collateral on a super senior basis to the Notes. See “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—The Super Senior Facilities.” Availability of the additional guarantee_
amounts under the Pensions Guarantee Facility or the Guarantee Facility, however, is subject to certain
conditions, including compliance with certain financial covenants.

###### Contractual commitments and contingencies

Our contractual commitments comprise primarily our contractual obligations to perform work invoiced, but not
yet completed and warranty commitments, which related to assumed expenditures in the future for rectifying
errors and shortcomings regarding concluded projects that arise during the warranty period for the projects. See
Notes 24 and 25 to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding provisions
related to these liabilities.

In connection with our operations, we are required to provide a certain number of commitments in terms of
performance guarantees for completion of work, guarantees of customer advances and parent company
guarantees. As of March 31, 2023, we estimate that performance guarantees amounted to approximately SEK
445 million, approximately SEK 38 million was provided under the Guarantee Facility, with the remainder
provided principally by insurance companies on an unsecured basis, as well as commercial banks. .

Additional variable cash consideration of up to SEK 526 million was payable over the next three years as of
March 31, 2023.

###### Risk Management

We are exposed to various types of risks, both operational and financial. Operational risks are associated with
day-to-day operations relating to economic activity, tendering, capacity utilization, price risks and revenue
recognition. Financial risks arise from the amount of capital tied up and our capital requirements. We believe we
are exposed to greater operational risks than financial risks.

###### Financial Risk Management

In our installation business risks are asymmetric. In any given project, the chances of exceeding the expected
outcome during the term of the project are limited while there is a risk of incurring significant losses in relation
to the size of the project. The management of operational risks is a continuous process covering a large number
of ongoing projects and service assignments. We have designed several methods to ensure that operational risks
remain under control. We believe our systematic work on quality and environmental issues as well as
occupational health and safety issues are key building blocks that underpin our management systems. Our
financial risks are managed centrally for the purpose of minimizing and controlling our risk exposure while credit
risks are managed locally at each of our profit centers.

###### Operational Risks

 Economic Activity

Fluctuations in the economy affect the building services sector, which is sensitive to market fluctuations and
political decisions that can have an impact on demand for residential and commercial new builds and investments
in industry and the public sector. Demand for service and maintenance work is less sensitive to fluctuations in
the economy.

###### Tendering

An installation and service company is exposed to commercial and production-related risks, which need to be
identified and managed during the tendering process. To ensure that this is done, we have implemented process
descriptions and checklists that are aimed at identifying and pricing the risks in our cost estimates and tenders.

###### Capacity Utilization

Capacity utilization is heavily dependent on demand in our geographic markets. An unforeseen decline in
capacity utilization generally results in a loss of revenue, which in the short term cannot be offset by a
corresponding cost reduction. We seek to mitigate these risks through continuous resource planning, including
redundancies if order backlog does not support current local staffing levels and by employing subcontractors
during periods of peak production.

###### Price Risks

Unforeseen variations in input prices and prices charged by subcontractors constitute a risk. We seek to offset
the risk of rising prices through the use of contract forms that are appropriate for the project, indexation for fixedprice agreements and efficient purchasing procedures.

###### Insurance

We believe we have adequate insurance coverage for our operations, comprising liability, contract and property
insurance.

###### Internal Controls

Our Boards act as the ultimate source of internal controls. Our Boards have delegated to senior management the
establishment and implementation of a system of internal controls appropriate to our business. These controls
include the safeguarding of assets; the maintenance of proper accounting records; the reliability of financial
information; and compliance with appropriate legislation, regulation and best practice.

Our operations are decentralized and governed based on a shared framework, clear allocation of roles and
responsibilities and systematic monitoring. Our branch managers are continuously supported and monitored at

116


-----

the regional, business area Group level to ensure appropriate risk managed and improved profitability. This
support is carried out by, among other things, project selection controls and project execution controls.

Management and administration are performed at the branch level by our branch-level managers at
approximately 199 of our local branch offices locations throughout the Nordic region as of March 31, 2023. Our
branch-level managers report to their respective regional manager who in turn reports to the Business Area
manager who together with the CEO, CFO and Head of Communication form senior executive management.
Each of our branches consists of, and is responsible for, one or more profit centers. We characterize our profit
centers as either installation profit centers or service profit centers, based on the predominant operations
conducted by the applicable profit center.

In relation to project selection, tenders are approved based on project size, assuming standard contractual terms.
Projects under SEK 10 million can be approved directly by the branch office, with projects between SEK 10
million to 20 million and SEK 20 million to SEK 50 million required to be approved at the region and business
area level, respectively. Projects between SEK 50 million to SEK 100 million must be approved at the Group
level and contracts over SEK 100 million are required to be approved by our Board. With respect to project
execution, branches are supported by an established system of financial, internal and management controls.

###### Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements

 Recognition of revenue over time

The reported earnings in ongoing contract projects are recognized over time on the basis of assignment
expenditures incurred in relation to the total estimated assignment fees of the assignment. Costs associated with
this are recognized in earnings as they arise. This requires reliable calculation of project revenue and project
costs. The precondition is a properly functioning system for cost accounting, forecasting processes and project
monitoring. The forecast regarding the project’s final outcome is a critical judgement that is material to the
operating report over the course of the project. There may be a risk that the final result as regards the project
could deviate from what is gradually reported.

###### Pensions

We have partial defined-benefit pension plans. The pension obligations are calculated using actuarial
assumptions, and plan assets are marked to market on the balance-sheet date. A change in any of these
assumptions and measurements could have a significant impact on calculated pension commitments and pension
cost.

###### Intangible assets

 Impairment testing of goodwill

The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units are based on the assumption of future conditions and estimates
of various parameters. Changes in these assumptions and estimates could have an effect on the carrying amount
of goodwill. A recession in the rate of growth and operating margin would yield a lower recoverable amount.
The reverse applies if the recoverable amount were calculated based on a higher rate of growth or margin. If
future cash flows are discounted at a higher interest rate, the recoverable amount would be lower. The reverse
would apply if the recoverable amount were to rise in conjunction with discounting at a lower discount rate.

###### Warranty provisions

We make warranty provisions are made for the warranty obligations found in the contract assignments being
performed. A warranty expenditure arises in a project when a Group company performs extra work as a result of
shortcomings that emerged in the original contract, in work performed or in materials. A warranty reserve is
calculated based on the probable costs of correcting the faults that arose in the contract. The scope of the warranty
provision is established based on:

- previous experiences in similar projects;

- the anticipated scope of the extra work; and

117


-----

- the estimated cost.

###### Onerous leases

When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is immediately
recognized as an expense in its entirety. An onerous lease is a contract in which the unavoidable costs for meeting
the obligations under the contract exceed the anticipated financial benefits. The expected loss is immediately
recognized as a cost in its entirety.

###### INDUSTRY

 Overview

The Nordic installation market, which comprises the combined installation markets of Sweden, Norway and
Finland, is a highly fragmented market, at SEK 290 billion aggregate spend in 2022 according to an independent
third-party consultant.

The installation market can be segmented into two categories: (i) new-build installations and (ii) renovation,
maintenance and services of existing installations. Because the Nordic construction market is mature, most of
the activity is driven by renovation, maintenance and services of existing installations, rather than new-build.

- **_New-build installations represent about 34 per cent. of the Nordic installation and service market._**

Demand for new-build installation results generally from the demand for new-build construction and has
therefore been sensitive historically to macroeconomic factors such as GDP growth, interest rates and
real-estate prices among other factors, although with a slight time lag owing to the downstream nature of
the activity (installation occurring at the end of the construction process of a building). Although the new
construction segment is generally cyclical, significant local and regional variations within different
countries influence end-market exposure. It is also worth noting that public sector spendings have
historically exhibited less volatility compared to the residential and commercial construction sectors,
primarily because government spending in the Nordic region have historically been increased during
economic downturns.

Due to a reduction in economic activity caused by the current macroeconomic environment, new
construction activity in the medium-term is expected to experience some slowdown as projected by an
independent third-party consultant in 2023 and 2024. However, the Group has limited exposure to markets
expected to experience the sharpest contraction, such as new residential construction. Moreover, as a
leading player with scale and a track record of execution excellence in a fragmented market, the Group is
well positioned relative to the small- and medium-sized players in terms of cyclicality and to potentially
gain further market share.

- **_Renovation, maintenance and services represent about 66 per cent. of the Nordic installation and service_**
market.

Demand for maintenance has generally shown a higher level of stability compared to new-build and,
similar to renovation, is largely driven by the age and composition of the buildings. During economic
downturns, customers have a demonstrated preference for renovation and maintenance as opposed to new
construction, which has traditionally resulted in countercyclical effects in the renovation and maintenance
segment. Expenditures on renovation and maintenance are more flexibly managed and constitute part of
a customer’s general operating expenses, making them less susceptible to reductions in customer spending
and resulting in stable revenue flow for service providers. Moreover, demand for renovation and
maintenance is primarily driven by the age and composition of real estate.

Given its high resilience, it can be expected that the renovation market will sustain stable growth in the
near term as projected by an independent third-party consultancy.

The Nordic installation market can also be segmented by activity into: (i) Electrical; (ii) Heating and Sanitation
and (iii) Ventilation.

- **_Electrical is one of the largest installation market segments and includes the installation of wiring and_**
fittings, lighting systems, street lighting, electrical signs, airport runway lighting, satellite dishes, alarms,
solar energy collectors and connecting of electronic appliances, as well as their maintenance and repair.

- **_Heating and Sanitation_** includes the installation of plumbing and heating systems, as well as their
maintenance and repair.

119


-----

- **_Ventilation includes the installation of ventilation and air-conditioning systems, as well as their_**
maintenance and repair.

Some activities are regulated, and our technicians and engineers (in particular plumbers and electricians) are
required to be certified. This creates staff scarcity in some market segments, in particular in the Assemblin
Electrical and Assemblin H&S segments. Larger companies such as the Group are perceived as more stable and
offering greater career opportunities to staff in the long-term. The Group is therefore well placed to benefit from
the barriers to entry stemming from certification requirements.

###### Market size and outlook

The Nordic renovation and maintenance and service market is expected to exhibit steady growth, even excluding
the impact from inflation while some near term headwind is expected in the new-build market.

The following table sets forth the historical and forecast evolution of the size of the various market segments
within the Nordic installation market for the years indicated.

The acquisition of Fidelix increases our exposure to the rapidly growing building automation markets of building
management systems (“BMS”) and individual metering and debiting (“IMD”). These end-markets have grown
above the rest of the installation market and are expected to continue to do so in the medium- to long-term. The
factors driving the robust market growth include energy efficiency, sustainability, cloud computing and IoT,
tightening regulation, increase in energy prices and focus on indoor climate. Moreover, the scope of activities
and services for Fidelix is continuously expanding driven by advancements in technology in machine learning,
automated diagnostics and smarter building automation systems. These macro drivers also result in a high level
of cycle resilience as was seen during the global financial crisis of 2008-09 and during COVID-19 in 2020.

###### Secular growth drivers

Beyond macroeconomic and cycle considerations, several structural growth trends within the Nordic installation
market support long-term market growth. These include:

- **_Energy efficiency: Increasing demand for energy efficient systems in buildings, driven by economic,_**
environmental and regulatory pressures, provide significant growth opportunities, wherein installation
solutions can be customized to each building to achieve low energy use. Stimulus programs introduced
by various national governments and the EU to kick start recovery from the current economic slowdown
are expected to help accelerate this trend as a number of these stimulus programs are specifically targeted
or focused on the Green agenda. Examples include Sweden’s SEK 9.7 billion proposal for investments in
green recovery initiatives in the Budget Bill for 2021, the EU’s €500 billion green stimulus package
passed in July 2020, Norway’s May 2020 proposal to spend €360 million to support a greener economy
and the EIB’s €150 million in financing for new near-zero-energy buildings and renovation investments
to improve energy efficiency of existing buildings in the Helsinki metropolitan area;

120


-----

- **_Growing demand for more advanced technology systems: Increasingly tech-heavy properties require_**
more advanced technology systems, with a higher demand for IoT, energy efficient systems and security
system automatization offering several growth avenues;

- **_Increasing pace of urbanization: Increased inflow of inhabitants in Nordic cities increases the need for_**
new residential buildings and public properties while also placing greater requirements on safer and more
efficient and modern premises;

- **_Higher degree of digitalization: Growing digitalization creates new requirements for managing data and_**
allows for the creation of new technical installations to monitor and optimize energy efficiency while also
driving greater demand for service due to increased complexity of technical installations and systems;

- **_Partnering projects: New forms of close collaboration between various parties in the construction process_**
increases the importance of coordination of installations while also enabling greater efficiency in the
production process and energy usage through multi-tech procurements; and

- **_Greater need for renovation in ageing buildings: A significant portion of the Nordic building stock is of_**
considerable age prompting an upcoming renovation wave for buildings from the 1970s and 1980s and
also driven by the potential to reduce energy usage in Sweden through renovations in existing building
stock.

###### Competitive landscape

The Nordic installation market is highly fragmented, and competition is largely focused on a contract by contract
basis at a local level. As a result, the Group rarely competes against larger pan-Nordic players such as Bravida,
Instalco, Caverion, GK or Kemp & Lauritzen but rather against local small or medium-sized enterprises
(“SMEs”), such as ELEffekt, Robmac and Stockholms Elektriska.

However, we believe that customers demand an increasingly broad range of services and expertise from
installation services providers, including a single point of contact for delivery of integrated solutions, in order to
optimize their procurement process. Many SMEs specialize in a particular activity and regional area but are
unable to offer “one-stop shop” solutions. This offers a potential advantage of larger groups and has led to the
consolidation of small, local businesses over the years which is a trend we expect will continue.

This is particularly true for larger projects which are generally awarded on price, but also on some qualitative
factors such as breadth and depth of services, technical know-how, ability to deliver tailored, state-of-the-art
solutions across multiple fields of technology, which tend to play well to the advantage of larger players. Scale
itself is a differentiating factor as SMEs are unlikely to have the financial strength to undertake large, lengthy
projects.

Moreover, as customers increasingly evaluate the value position of service providers in terms of ongoing
performance of installed equipment, technological competence is becoming particularly important. The Group
has maintained a clear strategic focus on technologies and digital systems and Fidelix’s technology-driven focus
will help solidify the Group’s positioning, particularly in one of the most attractive niches of the installation
services market that caters to building automation. As a fully integrated player in this market, Fidelix faces
competition from different parts of the value chain. Competitors include large industrial goods players such as
Schneider and Siemens which are the only players bigger than Fidelix in its focus markets of Finland and Sweden.
However, unlike Schneider and Siemens which are only focused on large projects, Fidelix is able to cover a wider
installed base creating upselling and aftermarket sales opportunities, references and expertise across building
types and deeper visibility into market outlook. Fidelix has been able to build on this further with its established
position, open system and competitive pricing to capture market share as has been consistently seen historically
and expected to continue forward.

Local contracts tend to be of smaller size and often awarded based on customer relationships with managers at
local branches, in addition to price considerations. It is therefore critical to empower staff locally so that they are
incentivized to develop not only customer relationships and intimacy, but also raise brand awareness and

121


-----

maximize talent acquisition. Network density and customer proximity can create cost and service quality
leadership which a one-branch competitor would not benefit from.

###### BUSINESS

 Overview

We are one of the Nordic region’s leading providers of smart and sustainable installation and service solutions,
with our primary activities focusing on electrical engineering, heating & sanitation, ventilation and smart
buildings & automation, such as building management systems (“BMS”) and individual metering and debiting
(“IMD”), as well as key competencies in data & telecoms, industrial pipes, district heating, cooling, sprinklers,
security and green technology solutions (“GreenTech”).

We hold a strong position in the growing installation market in the Nordic countries in which we operate
(comprising Sweden, Norway and Finland), which are estimated at approximately SEK 125 billion, SEK 90
billion and SEK 66 billion, respectively, and have a combined approximate value of SEK 282 billion as of
December 31, 2022. In 2021, within the installation and service market, we were the third largest company in
the Nordic countries in which we operate (comprised of Sweden, Norway and Finland), the second largest
company in Sweden, the third largest company in Norway and the seventh largest company in Finland, in each
case based on revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 according to an independent third-party consultant.
Our multi-technical offering, market share and size have enhanced our position as a competent and trusted partner
that provides reliable and efficient high-quality services in the context of an ongoing transformation towards a
more energy-efficient and sustainable society.

We provide design, installation, maintenance and service solutions for a wide range of properties, industrial
facilities and infrastructure projects for a diverse customer base consisting of over 20,000 large and small
customers, which include construction companies, the public sector, property owners and industrial companies.
Our installation business consists of the installation of technical systems as part of the construction of new
properties and the renovation or upgrade of technical systems as part of the reconstruction and renovation of
properties, improving their functionality and comfort. Our design and maintenance capabilities complement
our installation business. Lastly, our service business consists of the operation, maintenance, repair,
replacement, reconfiguration and monitoring of technical installations in buildings, industrial plants and
infrastructure. Our strong relationships with our customers have contributed to an order backlog of SEK 9,115
million and an LTM order intake of SEK 12,836 million, respectively, as of March 31, 2023, and we currently
have over 3,000 ongoing projects as of March 31, 2023. We take on primarily two types of assignments:
contractor assignments and service assignments. The proportion of contractor assignments and service
assignments represented 58 per cent. and 42 per cent., respectively, of our net revenue for the twelve months
ended March 31, 2023.

Our operations are decentralized and governed based on a shared framework, clear allocation of roles and
responsibilities and systematic monitoring. Our current operating organization is divided into five specific
business areas: three in Sweden (Assemblin Electrical, Assemblin H&S and Assemblin Ventilation), one in
Norway (Assemblin Norway) and one in Finland, which also includes BMS products and IMD operations in
Sweden and Norway (Assemblin Finland), comprising approximately 199 branches with approximately 6,890
FTE employees in the Nordic region as of March 31, 2023. We believe that our decentralized business model
contributes to the profitability of our operations. This decentralized and entrepreneurial business model allows
us to swiftly adjust to a largely variable cost structure and promotes enterprise and accountability at all levels of
our structure, with the president of each business area being responsible, together with their management groups,
for the operations and earnings in their respective business areas.

The following map shows our branch footprint, representing the locations in which we operated in the Nordic
region as of March 31, 2023.

We have been owned by Triton since 2015, and since then have expanded our geographical presence and volumes
through the acquisition of 75 additional companies to date (55 of which were since January 1, 2020), the
largest of which was our 2016 acquisition of Skanska Installation, a carve-out from the broader construction
company Skanska. Our organic and inorganic growth has made us into a complete installation and service
partner, with the strength of a multidisciplinary group and the personal presence of a local company.

In the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, we had total net revenue of SEK 14,089 million, a net profit for
the period of SEK 434 million, EBITA of SEK 1,030 million, Adjusted EBITA of SEK 1,005 million and Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA of SEK 1,304 million. This was supported by our strong order backlog, which stood
at SEK 9,115 million as of March 31, 2023.

The table below sets out the net revenue, Adjusted EBITA (and corresponding margin), order backlog, share of
service assignments, average number of FTE employees and number of branches for each of our business
areas as of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023.

###### Competitive Strengths

 A leading Nordic platform with strong market positions and local densities

We are the second largest installation and service provider in Sweden (with an 8 per cent. market share, compared
to 11 per cent. for the first largest competitor, 7 per cent. for the third largest competitor and 4 per cent. for the
fourth largest competitor), and the third largest within the installation and service market in the Nordic countries
in which we operate (with a 5 per cent. market share, compared to 7 per cent. for each of the first and second
largest competitors, respectively, and 4 per cent. for the fourth largest competitor), all based on revenue for the
year ended December 31, 2021, as measured by an independent third-party consultant.

Our wider group and local scale provide differentiating competitive advantages. At the business area level, we
are able to utilize our procurement expertise to optimize sourcing supplier terms within each business area and
leverage on our digital capabilities. At the business area level, we also have strong HR, financial and business
development functions complementing resources on a regional and local level. In addition, on a Group level, we
leverage certain central functions such as finance, legal, communication and our central IT platform.

At the local level, our geographic network comprises approximately 199 branches in close proximity to
customers in selectively targeted markets: nation-wide in Sweden, the greater Oslo area in Norway and the
Helsinki-Turku-Tampere triangle in Finland. Moreover, we strengthened our footprint in Finland in 2021 through
the acquisitions of Fidelix and Tom Allen Senera. In certain locations, our business areas share branch premises,
which allows for significant cross-selling and cost-reduction opportunities. In addition to being better positioned
to win local tenders, our cross-staffing ability between branches allows us to optimize project selection. Further,
our local scale has allowed us to build a workforce of approximately 6,890 FTE employees in the Nordic region
as of March 31, 2023, with many of our employees preferring to work for a larger, but decentralized, company
such as ourselves due to supportive and clear governance, stability, brand awareness and personal development
opportunities.

Along with holding a leading market position across the Nordic countries in which we operate, we have a strong
local leadership position, as reflected by the diagram below showing the percentage of our revenues for the year
ended December 31, 2020 in the Assemblin Electrical, Assemblin Ventilation and Assemblin H&S business
areas, split by Swedish regions where we have (i) less than 5 per cent. market share for those respective regions,
(ii) between 5 and 10 per cent. market share for those respective regions and (iii) more than 10 per cent. market
share for those respective regions, as well as our average market share in the Swedish regions in which we operate
split by business area.

###### Attractive market growth supported by accelerating long-term megatrends

We operate in a growing market, which is estimated by an independent third-party consultant to grow at a
compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 5 per cent., from 2022 to 2025, reaching a combined approximate
value of SEK 334 billion in 2025 (assuming SEK/EUR exchange rate of 10.8). The Nordic installation and
service market's growth is driven by a number of positive trends driving investments in the space, including: (i)
regulatory tailwinds; (ii) reinforced need for renovation; and (iii) transition to smart buildings. In the service

126


-----

market in particular, which has become a growing focus of our business, the key drivers are expected to include:
(i) cost inflation (estimated 4 per cent. CAGR contribution from 2021 to 2024), as service contracts generally
include mechanisms to pass-through inflation to customers; (ii) growth in building stock (estimated 0.1 per cent.
CAGR contribution from 2021 to 2024), as growth in underlying building stock drives an increase in the number
of installations, and therefore service requirements; (iii) the COVID-19 rebound (estimated 1 per cent. CAGR
contribution from 2021 to 2024), as services suffered during the COVID-19 pandemic due to sick leave, and
restrictions on site work, balanced by a market rebound to pre-COVID levels due to pent up demand; and (iv)
service intensity and outsourcing propensity (estimated 1 per cent. CAGR contribution from 2021 to 2024), as
increased intensity and complexity drives the need for more frequent and qualified services, as well as increased
outsourcing. (Source: Independent third-party consultant.)

Sustainability has also become increasingly important, as evidenced by the European Union’s target to be
climate-neutral with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Improving energy efficiency in buildings
through efficient technical installation solutions and BMS will play an important role in reaching these targets,
as buildings account for approximately 40 per cent. of the European energy consumption (according to the
European Commission). In addition, the increased focus on sustainability drives demand for installation and
service of heat pumps, solar panels, systems for other renewable energy sources and energy storage.
Digitalization underpinned by rapid technological advancement creates new opportunities within the installation
and service industry, where BMS play an integral role in the construction of smart buildings. In addition, larger
populations in urban centers, and limited available space, drives demand for larger and more complex buildings,
requiring more installation work, maintenance and service of systems. Furthermore, societal trends such as
changing consumer demands, the general evolution of the real estate market and a comprehensive reorganization
of office spaces triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic also supports growth in our markets. We believe that these
trends will drive increased volume and complexity in technical installations, thereby driving growth in our
markets.

###### Highly resilient business model underpinned by exposure to resilient end-markets, significant revenue diversification and a flexible cost base

The Nordic installation and service market has historically been relatively resilient during economic downturns.
For example, the renovation and services segment in the Nordic market during the 2008-2009 financial crisis
experienced slow growth, rather than a decline, and the service segment was only moderately impacted by the
COVID-19 pandemic. Renovation and new build projects continued growing throughout the COVID-19
pandemic and the service market suffered only a slight contraction due to the difficulty experienced by service
technicians in gaining access to work-sites and buildings due to pandemic restrictions (rather than demand-driven
factors).

Our presence across a diverse set of end-markets with a high share of service assignments further enhances our
resilience. A large part of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 originated from cycle-resilient
end-markets such as healthcare (10 per cent.), education & culture (6 per cent.), infrastructure (3 per cent.) and
service assignments (42 per cent.). Moreover, we have limited exposure to the residential market as, for the year
ended December 2021, approximately 14 per cent. of our end-market exposure was attributable to contractor
assignments in the residential market, with new residential builds representing a portion of it. (Source:
_Independent third-party consultant.) For the year ended December 13, 2021 and based on sales, approximately_
30 per cent. of the Nordic installation and service market was made up of new builds, 25 per cent. of service
assignments and 44 per cent. of renovation assignments. (Source: Independent third-party consultant.) Other
factors that add to our resilience are our order backlog of committed orders that allows us the planning horizon
to adjust our cost base and project margins after dips in the construction market, and the long-term nature of our
service assignments.

We also have limited dependency on a specific customer or type of contract. According to our management’s
estimates, our top ten customers accounted for approximately 22 per cent. and our top 3 customers accounted for
14 per cent. of net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. Furthermore, we have limited exposure to
large contracts that would expose us to material risk from any one project. Based on net revenue for the year

127


-----

ended December 31, 2022, contractor assignments (which include both installation projects as well as certain
service projects subject to percentage of completion accounting) over SEK 50 million, between SEK 10-50
million, between 5-10 million and less than 5 million represented 10 per cent., 18 per cent., 10 per cent. and 20
per cent. of our net revenues, respectively, and the remaining 42 per cent. of our net revenues were derived from
service assignments.

In addition to resilience from diversified exposures across end-markets, customers and contracts, we also benefit
from a high level of visibility in our business model. Installation is the last part of the typical construction project,
so branch managers are able to identify early signs in the changes of market dynamics and adjust our cost base,
which is approximately 89 per cent. variable or semi variable in nature for the year ended December 31, 2022,
as necessary. This variable cost base is driven by our minimal overhead costs and fixed assets and our cost-base
is inflation protected given the short duration of the majority of our projects (less than one year on average) and
service, and pass-through mechanisms and long durations in our service contracts. Our ability to proactively
manage or swiftly react to such changes in market dynamics is supported by our lean and decentralized
operational organization. Our order book of contractor assignments enhances near-term visibility which has
consistently stayed above 100 per cent of last twelve months of project revenues since the year ended December
31, 2019 and a high and growing share of recurring services that has increased from 38 per cent. during the year
ended December 31, 2019 to 42 per cent. during the twelve months ended March 31, 2023. We take a consistent
approach to order booking and only include signed contracts in our order backlog. Our order backlog is also
conservatively stated as we are able to pass through inflationary effects to our customers rather than adjusting
backlog upwards.

###### A proven ability to navigate an inflationary environment

Even in an inflationary environment, our contract structures drive our ability to achieve our desired level of
profitability. According to management estimates for Sweden and Norway, approximately 65 per cent. of our
contracts are structured with a cost-plus pricing approach giving us the ability to pass through input price inflation
onto our customers. We are also able to mitigate inflationary pressures on the remaining approximately 35 per
cent. of revenue under fixed price contracts with its typically short-term contract length and an optimized central
procurement system, which allows us to accurately estimate costs whilst bidding for contracts.

The diagram below shows our management’s estimate of our revenues by contract type during the year ended
December 31, 2022.

(1) Estimates are indicative and based on management’s review with local managers in Sweden and Norway of contracts that were
expected to be delivered in 2022.

(2) Management believes it is able to reflect the impact of inflation in its pricing of service assignments (including driven by the small
and short term-nature of some of the service assignments). In management’s opinion, small and short-term service assignments are
cost plus in nature as they allow for a high conviction view on the impact of inflation on expected costs, and pricing is set
accordingly to secure a desired level of profitability.

128


-----

We have maintained and continued to expand our margins in recent periods despite the inflationary backdrop, as
construction cost inflation has increased in Sweden from 8.5 per cent. for the six months ended June 30, 2021 to
14.9 per cent. for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

###### Operating model underpinned by disciplined local entrepreneurship coupled with a relentless focus on operational excellence

We believe that our decentralized business model, structured around technical disciplines and supported by strong
leadership teams creates a distinct competitive advantage compared to other players in the market. The division
of our business into technical disciplines allows managers and their teams to focus on growing operations within
their areas of expertise. This structure also provides career development opportunities for talented employees
within their respective business lines and promotes sharing of experiences, competences, and best practices.
Furthermore, we believe that it is more attractive for acquired companies to be integrated into a business area
focused on the same technical discipline as themselves, and our structure facilitates the efficient integration of
acquired companies.

Within each business area, we promote an “entrepreneurial” culture. Branch managers are expected to drive
margin improvement and lead a specialized and skilled workforce. Typically, branch managers are selected based
on their personnel management skills and previous project manager experience. Branch managers receive
financial incentives in the form of bonuses based on Adjusted EBITA Margin and working capital levels. The
size of these bonuses depends on the size of the branch, the manager’s monthly salary, and the portion of Adjusted
EBITA Margin above a pre-determined threshold. This underpins our cultural focus on margins over volumes
and creates strong disincentives for managers to take on low-margin or high-risk contracts. Branch managers'
success is linked to their in-depth local market knowledge and strong customer relationships, supported by
specialist functions at regional, business area and to some extent group level (including design and tendering,
legal, procurement, HR, finance, ESG and communication).

We believe that our decentralized business model contributes to the profitability of our operations, and that it
increases commitment from its employees and local managers. While each business area develops its own
practices, we maintain a strong shared culture based on core values, guiding principles and fundamental ethical
standpoints set forth in our Code of Conduct.

The success of our business model is evidenced by our track record of margin improvement. We have
successfully increased our Adjusted EBITA margin over the past six years from around 3 per cent. to 7.1 per
cent. in the last twelve months ended March 31, 2023. The comprehensive nature of our operational excellence
is evident in our improving margins at the individual branch level. We have reduced the proportion of lossmaking branches in our network from approximately 30 per cent. in 2017 to 14 per cent. in 2022. At the same
time, the proportion of branches delivering over 10 per cent. Adjusted EBITA Margin increased from 12 per cent.
to 26 per cent. over the same period.

129


-----

The diagram below shows the split of our branches by profitability, measured as the number of branches that
have an Adjusted EBITA margin of less than 0 per cent., between 0 per cent. and 2.5 per cent., between 2.5 per
cent. and 7.5 per cent., between 7.5 per cent. and 10.0 per cent. and over 10.0 per cent., for the year ended
December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.

(1) Excludes divested and discontinued branches in LTM period

This margin improvement has been achieved through the implementation of systematic project selection criteria
and process management measures, the replacement of underperforming branch managers and projects and
closure of non-performing branches and a corporate culture focused on profitability over volume. We also
maintain structured follow-up and reporting procedures, user-friendly business intelligence tools for performance
monitoring and EBITA and NWC-based employee incentives on a branch level.

130


-----

To help us continually monitor our profitability enhancement measures, we track the following KPIs across our
organization:

Despite this improvement, we believe we will continue to have opportunities to increase our margins through
our organizational structure and strong profitability focus. We plan to continue to incentivize our branch
managers to seek margin enhancement initiatives on a local branch level to drive operational efficiency
improvements and further cost consciousness.

Following Triton’s acquisition of the Group, we have pursued a strategy of small-scale and accretive bolt-on
acquisitions in order to expand our business. Future potential targets may range from smaller accretive
investments to material acquisitions. We believe that the fragmentation in the markets in which we serve provides
a broad opportunity to continue consolidating with a deep and actionable pipeline of profitable targets by paying
a multiple of approximately 4-6 times the target’s EBITA, with an average target EBITA margin of 12 per cent.
(both based on acquisitions closed between 2017 and 2022 and excluding Tom Allen Senera and Fidelix). This
acquisition strategy allows us to strengthen our local competitive position, broaden the range of our offering and
increase our presence in existing markets, with a particular focus on targets supporting our smart and sustainable
solution offering. We carefully select actionable targets, by prioritizing potential acquisitions on; independent
ownership, profitability, culture and sustainable performance. We believe we are an acquirer of choice for
potential targets, due to our decentralized organizational set-up and our strong employer reputation
complemented by deep local relationships.

Our acquisition history by number of acquisitions and estimated total aggregate annual sales between 2017 and
the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 is presented below:

(1) For the twelve months ended March 31, 2023.

(2) Management’s conservative estimate of sales for the full year following the acquisition, based on the historical financials of each
acquired entity and the due diligence performed.

131


-----

By leveraging our strong local network and understanding of the market, we are able to source approximately 76
per cent. of our acquisitions by approaching a target outside of any formal process, such as bilaterally or through
our Assemblin platform. The remaining transactions have been sourced through brokers (approximately 24 per
cent.), mostly through exclusive processes (approximately 21 per cent.) and occasionally in competitive
processes (approximately 3 per cent.).

We have a strong and successful track record of integrating acquired entities into our business and a proven
acquisition strategy based on finding high quality targets with strong cultural compatibility, a structured
acquisition process and non-disruptive integration.

###### A focused ESG and digital strategy with a comprehensive proposition positioning the platform for the future

We believe that we are well positioned to benefit from the expected growth in higher margin segments of the
Nordic installation and service market, such as smart buildings, GreenTech, and niche segments including mainly
fire and security, sprinklers, cooling and refrigeration. Following our acquisition of Fidelix in September 2021,
we are the only large installation player with a sizeable offering providing end-to-end BMS solutions in the
Nordic region. According to an independent third-party consultant, our 2020 market share by revenue of 8 to 10
per cent. in the smart buildings segment in Sweden and Finland was approximately twice the market share of the
second largest installation company (at 4 to 6 per cent.), while the third and fourth largest players were estimated
to have a market share of 3 to 5 per cent. and less than 2 per cent., respectively.

We believe that our position as a sizable player within the BMS segment with strong technical competence and
end-to-end integration solutions, combined with its proprietary product offering provides a competitive
advantage. We can offer complete bespoke solutions to customers, from design to installation and subsequent
servicing of the systems.

Furthermore, we have a strong GreenTech offering, which includes resource-efficient products and solutions to
improve energy efficiency and optimization, solar panel installations, renewable heating solutions and electric
vehicle charging solutions, and BMS solutions. We have enhanced our GreenTech offering through the
acquisitions of Tom Allen Senera, a Finnish provider of energy optimized systems for buildings including, among
others, geothermal solutions, and Electrotec Energy, an experienced solar panel installation provider with
experience in solar cells and energy storage. Through our BMS and GreenTech offering, we are strongly
positioned to support our customer’s smart building, digitalization and energy transition.

Beyond being an ESG enabler for customers, we are also committed to achieving our own ESG targets, including
plans to reduce CO2 emissions (scope 1 and 2) by 50 per cent. by 2030 and achieve climate neutrality by 2040.

Additionally, we have a strong focus on governance that is centered around a solid governance model, employee
safety and a sustainable community around us. During the three year period ended December 31, 2022, our
average voluntary personnel turnover was only 11.2 per cent. compared to 13.2 per cent. for our top 2 listed
competitors, as presented in their public reporting.

###### Cash-generative and resilient financial profile with high revenue visibility from late-cycle presence, order backlog and recurring service contracts

We have improved our Adjusted EBITA margin over the past six years from around 3 per cent. during the year
ended December 31, 2017 to 7.1 per cent. in the twelve months ended March 31, 2023. Our ability to address
market demand and new customer orders as well our focus on empowering branch managers and providing fixed
services at the Group level have enabled us to improve profitability.

Our high cash flow generation has been driven by capital-lite operations together with efficient working capital
management. Our operations require very limited capital expenditure and lease expenses, which primarily
comprises tools, vehicles, refurbishment and IT, with Net Capital Expenditure including vehicle leases
representing 1.4 per cent. of net revenue for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023. We have a high focus on
working capital management across the Group. Our ability to generate Free Cash Flow has contributed to our
growth and has allowed us to undertake a successful acquisition strategy. Our successful and proven business

132


-----

model, combined with well-established long-term customer relationships, will enable us to continue to achieve
profitable growth and deleverage going forward.

###### Experienced management team leading a value oriented business

Our decentralized network is managed by a highly experienced management team, consisting of professionals
with strong backgrounds and operational expertise within technical installation and service solutions, and a
proven track record of acquiring and integrating new businesses, with strong leaderships centered around
technical disciplines. Our CEO and President, Mats Johansson, has significant experience in leading management
roles in large companies within the construction and installation market, and our CFO, Philip Carlsson,
contributes his strong transactional and financial experience in the Nordics as well as experience in another
installation company, while our Head of Communication and Sustainability, Åsvor Brynnel, has a strong
background in the real estate and Nordic service sector. In addition, most of our business areas presidents have
over 20 years of installation industry experience and a long tenure with us. Under their leadership, we have had
a successful track record of margin expansion, completed numerous acquisitions, and have positioned the us as
a leading installation company in the Nordic region. We believe that the combination of highly experienced
management teams, both at the Group as well as at the branch level, provides us with a key advantage in
continuing to seek growth and development of each business area and for the Group.

###### Our Strategy

 Grow the service business across the Group

We have transitioned from a mainly project-focused organization to establishing separate local service
organizations with dedicated service managers, increased the hiring of service technicians and also established
separate tracking measures and employee- and manager margin-linked incentives.

Service revenue has shown strong growth with a CAGR of 15 per cent. between 2019 and the last twelve-month
period ended March 31, 2023. This growth was particularly driven by “service champions”, i.e., branches
growing services-sourced revenue above 15 per cent. year-on-year. Between 2019 and the last twelve-month
period ended March 31, 2023, our service revenue has grown at a CAGR approximately 1.3 times its project
revenue CAGR. We expect that growth in our service revenues will increase our bottom line, as our service
assignments tend to have higher margins than our contractor assignments.

We aim to drive further growth in the services business by: (i) applying best practices developed by service
champions across our entire branch network; (ii) identifying, attracting, training, retaining and motivating a
sufficient number of highly skilled technical employees, which we consider to be a key factor to grow the
relatively personnel-dependent service business across the Group; (iii) strengthen the coordination of our sales
teams to increase project-to-service sales conversion; and (iv) enhance key account management activities to
increase the number of larger services customers assignments.

###### Continue to focus on profitable growth by lifting performance across the Group's branch network

We are determined to grow our business profitably and sustainably, fulfilling our potential by increasing market
share and winning new contractor assignments and service contracts without compromising on profitability.

We are well positioned to grow our market shares in Sweden, Norway and Finland by continuing to provide highquality services and by focusing on strengthening local operations. We intend to continue to operate a large,
decentralized organization, with local branch units operating as individual profit centers, and to uplift margins in
average and underperforming branches. Due to our decentralized organization, branch performance and the
ability to improve branch profitability margins are highly dependent on attracting, retaining and motivating key
employees, including branch managers. We evaluate branch performance issues through a comprehensive set of
key performance indicators, such as employee competence, contract execution, order intake, procurement
performance, service portfolio management, overhead management and invoicing/cash collection procedures,
and addresses performance issues through a tailored action plan. Specifically, we aim to improve margins at
average and underperforming branches through: (i) a strong focus on active performance management of local
operations; (ii) employee education and skill enhancement initiatives (including training and monitoring courses

133


-----

for technicians to drive upselling and better leverage our brand); (iii) branch governance improvements
including; among others, improved tendering procedures and an efficient internal scorecard process; (iv) the
accelerated deployment of digital tools, including financial transparency tools, both on a branch as well as on a
project level; (v) accelerated project-to-service revenue conversion (by means of enhanced indicator-tracking
and follow-up procedures); and (vi) expanding to new untapped customers (based on a systematic customer base
analysis to identify high potential accounts and leveraging branch best practices for new customer conversion as
well as tracking customer conversion at a Group level).

Our Finnish operations are an area of our business where there is particularly large growth potential from
operational improvement programs. The Assemblin Finland business area has continuously improved, becoming
profitable in 2018 following a management change and successful acquisitions. Results of operation in Finland
were partially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic but during 2020 we focused on streamlining operations,
such as through adjusting our cost base and cutting less profitable branches, which resulted in significant
improvements in our margins in 2021. In 2022, we faced challenges with supply chain delays and project writedowns, which impacted our margins negatively. Our Adjusted EBITDA Margin for the twelve months ended
March 31, 2023 of 3.1 per cent., however, was a significant improvement from our margin of 1.9 per cent. for
the year ended December 31, 2022.

We have a strong record of historic margin improvements across our business in part due to our efforts to improve
profitability and cut costs across the Group and maximizing margins remains one of our long term growth
strategies.

###### Accelerate our proven and margin accretive acquisition strategy

We continuously evaluate new opportunities to acquire installation and technical services providers in the Nordic
region in order to strengthen our local competitive position, complement our offering and consolidate our
presence in attractive market segments. We have proven experience in identifying, executing and integrating
other companies, while remaining committed to our existing business model and values. To complement our
business strategy, we focus on targets with high margins, paying a multiple of approximately 4-6 times the target’s
EBITA, with an average target EBITA margin of 12% (both based on acquisitions closed between 2017 and 2022
and excluding Tom Allen Senera and Fidelix). In order to grow through margin accretive acquisitions, we need
to maintain operating agility and a strong ability to react to changing market dynamics, including a potential
increase in competition for the acquisition of attractive targets (which could result in higher purchase price
multiples). We have differentiated acquisition capabilities which cover the full cycle of an acquisition process
from the screening phase (by means of decentralized deal sourcing by business areas), to execution (through a
Group acquisition team providing execution bandwidth) and including post-closing integration (by means of
tailored toolboxes and governance solutions).

###### Accelerate growth in new expanding segments, building on strategic investments

Over a number of years, we have strengthened our position by complementing our traditional focus on technical
disciplines such as electrical, heating and sanitation, and ventilation, with growth in the smart buildings market
segment, GreenTech solutions, and other niche segments such as cooling and refrigeration (which typically have
higher growth and margins than the overall installation market). We expect to further expand our share in these
markets by combining our expertise with the capabilities of the companies acquired in recent years such as
Fidelix, Tom Allen Senera and Electrotec Energy. Electrotec Energy and Tom Allen Senera have strengthened
our offering of sustainable installation solutions, particularly in the areas of installation of solar panels and energy
storage (through the installation, maintenance and servicing of panels and energy storages) and heat pumps
(through a diversified product range including ground space, air to water and exhaust air implementing
installation with storage solutions), while the acquisition of Fidelix has enhanced our position in the BMS market
segment.

###### History

In 2016, following the acquisition by Triton, we changed our name to Assemblin. Prior to the acquisition, we
were Imtech Nordic, which was the result of the acquisition of a number of leading companies in Nordics with
strong reputations in their respective technical disciplines often spanning decades:

- Our Assemblin Electrical business area dates back to 1931, when Närkes Elektriska, NEA was founded
in Örebro. NEA eventually expanded nationwide in Sweden and became a leading actor in electrical
installations. Acquisitions over time, including the acquisition of Skanska Installation in 2016, have
contributed to what is currently the Assemblin Electrical business area.

- Our Assemblin H&S and Assemblin Norway business areas date back to 1902 and 1903, when the
companies Sana and Nordiska Värme were originally founded. In 1964, both companies joined to create
NVS, which became one of the leading heating & sanitation actors in the Nordic region and the
cornerstone of both the Assemblin H&S and the Assemblin Norway business areas.

- Our Assemblin Ventilation business area dates back to 1999, when Sydtotal was founded by industry
veterans in Malmö, to offer ventilation systems. The Assemblin Ventilation business area has since
expanded both through acquisitions and through greenfield expansion across Sweden.

- The Assemblin Finland business area dates back to 2007, when EMC was founded to provide multidisciplinary projects and maintenance, including electrical, plumbing and ventilation in Finland. The
Assemblin Finland business area has undergone extensive development in recent years, and the
acquisitions of both Fidelix and Tom Allen Senera greatly enhanced the breadth and quality of services
provided.

With Triton as our owner, we have subsequently grown through the acquisition of 75 additional companies, the
largest of which was our 2016 acquisition of Skanska Installation, a carve-out from the broader construction
company Skanska and, most recently, our acquisition of Fidelix. In 2021 and 2022, these acquisitions included
businesses with estimated aggregated annual revenues of SEK 2 billion, strengthening our footprint across
each of our business areas.

Our organic and inorganic growth has made us into a complete installation and service partner, with the strength
of a multidisciplinary group and the personal presence of a local company.

Over time, we have grown from a centralized business model with a focus on traditional capabilities such as
electrical, heating and sanitation and ventilation to a decentralized business model with improved governance, a
strong governance team and disciplined prioritization of projects with a focus on margins over volume. In recent
years, we have focused on growing our services business and accelerating accretive M&A, integrating ESG into
our strategy and expanding our digital capabilities, as well as focusing on high profitability at the branch level,
such as through our accelerated profitability program in 2019. Our business today is set up for accelerated growth,
with a focus on building automation and GreenTech.

###### Group Structure

We conduct our business through a number of subsidiaries. For more information on our corporate structure, see
“Summary—Corporate Structure and Certain Financing Arrangements.”

###### Description of our Operations

Our operations are decentralized and governed based on a shared framework, clear allocation of roles and
responsibilities and systematic monitoring. Our current operating organization is divided into five specific
business areas: three in Sweden (Assemblin Electrical, Assemblin H&S and Assemblin Ventilation), one in
Norway (Assemblin Norway) and one in Finland, including BMS products and IMD operations in Sweden and
Norway (Assemblin Finland), comprising approximately 199 branches and 32 regions in the Nordic countries in
which we operate (comprised of Sweden, Norway and Finland) as of March 31, 2023.

-----

Our operating organization is depicted in the graphic below.

The business areas are further divided into a number of regions, divisions and branches. At the regional level,
local branch performance is monitored monthly and reported to the business area management. Local branches
are responsible for earnings, personnel, sales and customer relationships. Managers at the regional level are
responsible for implementing the business area strategy in the region as well as for sourcing potential acquisition
targets. In addition, the regional functions provide support to branches during project tender processes. This is
generally the case with larger tenders, while small tenders are managed at branch level. At the business area
level, regional performance is monitored monthly and reported to Group management. Each business area sets
its strategy in accordance with the Group strategic outlook, and provides direct support to branches also with
regard to operational challenges.

At the Group level, finance, legal, IT, communication and sustainability functions are maintained. To ensure
consistent and high standards across our business areas, the Group’s strategy and business planning, corporate
governance, internal control, risk management and sustainability and digitization initiatives are coordinated at
the Group level. We communicate our framework through intra-Group communication initiatives, meetings and
training sessions (both physical and web-based). We also set minimum requirements at the Group level for
additional corporate functions, such as common standards for HR, procurement, business ethics and
environment.

Our strategic outlook is set out in a six-year horizon plan. Based on our horizon plan, we set three-year business
plans, which have associated goals and actions for each business area, region and branch. Our business plan is
reviewed by the board of directors on a yearly basis. We implement our business plan through our annual budgets
and activity-based action plans for both the entire Group and for each business area, and the business plan is
supplemented with local action plans for each region and branch.

We believe that our decentralized business model contributes to the profitability of our operations. This
decentralized and entrepreneurial business model allows us to swiftly adjust to a largely variable cost structure
and promotes enterprise and accountability at all levels of our structure with each of the business areas’ business

###### Our Customer Base and Customer Contracts

 Our Customer Base

We have a diversified customer base which values our high technical competence, ability to timely conclude
projects, strong local presence and documented experience with specific types of building construction. Our
customers range from multi-regional companies to small local businesses and property owners in a variety of
industries.

- **_Multi-regional construction companies: The Nordic construction market has several large, multi-_**
regional companies which manage large, medium and small-sized projects, and use installation providers
such as us as subcontractors. We primarily conduct contractor assignments (i.e., installation work for new
buildings or renovation projects) for these companies. Examples of customers within this customer group
include Peab, NCC, Veidekke and Skanska.

- **_Local construction companies: We also work closely with local construction companies in a_**
subcontracting role, primarily focusing our work on contractor assignments. In the local construction
market, strong relationships are essential to maintaining customers and partnerships.

- **_Public institutions: Many of our local customers are public institutions, which contract with us through_**
a public procurement process with strict specifications. Our work for public institutions includes both
project and service assignments. Examples of our customers include pension companies, county
councils/regions (such as Region Östergötland), municipalities, Akademiska Hus and FMV.

- **_Large real-estate developers and property owners: We work with large real-estate developers and_**
property owners on new build installation or renovation projects and service assignments (tailored for
existing buildings, including technical property management, energy solutions and maintenance).
Examples of our customers include Kungsleden, Ikano, Riksbyggen and Centrum Fastigheter.

- **_Industrial, retail chains and energy companies: Industrial and energy companies, as well as retail chains,_**
are highly knowledgeable about their own products and production processes. We primarily provide
service assignments to these companies, and, to a lesser extent, contractor assignments. Examples of our
customers include SAAB, Bauhaus, BillerudKorsnäs, Sandvik and Skellefteå Kraft.

- **_Small businesses and property owners: Small businesses and property owners purchase both service and_**
contractor assignments, but they do so with less frequency than our larger customers.

We are not reliant on any of our largest customers as, for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, management
estimates that our ten largest customers together accounted for approximately 38.2 per cent. of our net revenue.
Generally, our project base tends to consist of smaller-scale projects.

Our growth is driven by high customer satisfaction, and for 2021 we recorded a higher customer Net Promoter
Score (NPS score of 3) (“NPS”) than two of the other top four installation companies in the Nordic region (our
first, second and third competitors had NPS scores of (20), 11 and (35), respectively).

###### Tender Process and Pricing

We obtain most projects through competitive bidding in tender processes. The procedure for obtaining
assignments differs with respect to installation projects, on the one hand, and service assignments, on the other
hand. The tender process for installation projects typically involves substantial preparation work, including
estimates, planning and negotiations with the potential customer. Depending on the size of the potential project,
a tender process can last from a few days to more than a year. Agreements are signed at a fixed price or on current
account (meaning that they are on a running basis without the size and duration of the project defined at the

145


-----

beginning of the project and costs billed for hours worked and materials used to the customer), but sometimes
also as partnering agreements where the cost is based on a jointly defined target price with incentives for all
parties to fall below that target price. Our fixed price contracts tend to be of short-term duration, and we have a
strong central procurement function, which allows us to delay the impact of inflationary pressures and index our
costs. Our long term-fixed price contracts are mostly managed with a double index dynamic, whereby which we
index costs to customers and suppliers index costs to us.

By contrast, our service projects are typically based on framework agreements or ongoing relationships, and
contracts are often signed directly with end consumers and occasionally through intermediaries, such as facility
management companies. Prior involvement usually offers competitive advantages that can lead to new service
assignments after completed projects.

Pricing for installation and service projects takes place primarily at the local branch level, with larger projects
requiring approval from the Group or the Board. Factors that we typically take into account when pricing
installation projects and service assignments may include: (i) the purchase price of materials; (ii) wages and
hourly billing of project managers and employees; (iii) subcontractor costs; (iv) price differentiation for volume,
geography or competence; (v) the fixed price of subscription agreements (in the service sector); and/or (vi)
pricing adjustments relating to the economic cycle and general pricing adjustments.

###### Customer Contracts and Framework Agreements

Our customer contracts consist of individual service agreements for a fixed period, long-term framework
agreements (typically without agreed volumes) and oral agreements (in daily operations) and relate to contractor
assignments typically consisting of:

  - assignments where we are responsible for both the project design and installation activities, mainly for
customers such as construction companies (and typically not for the end-customer);

  - assignments where we are responsible for installation activities, while the customer is responsible for
the design of the project (customers in such situations are mainly construction companies or, to a lesser
extent, industrial companies), where we act as subcontractor and enter into standard subcontracting
arrangements; and

  - assignments where we are directly responsible for both project design and installation activities to the
end customer (“turn-key” projects), acting thereby as main contractor.

Additionally, we typically provide warranty and support service coverage to our customers. A standard warranty
period for customer agreements for installation projects is five years on materials and workmanship from the
date of acceptance and approval by the customer. Where applicable, the parties may sometimes agree on longer
guarantee periods for special equipment which is then typically agreed on a back-to-back basis with the suppliers.
This ensures adequate back-to-back coverage during the standard warranty period. In addition, we provide
project completion guarantees to clients, either through parent company guarantees, insurance policies or bank
guarantees.

A growing trend for our customers is the use of Integrated Project Delivery (“IPD”) (or partnering) contracts,
where we are involved at earlier stages in a project. IPD contracts ensure a more flexible pricing and allow for
changes during the course of the project itself, factoring a common interest between ourselves and the other
relevant parties in sharing risks and opportunities as they arise. The goal of this form of cooperation is that the
parties should have an incentive to help each other achieve a lower final cost and a higher flexibility for late
changes for the buyer and better profitability for installer/contractor through finding smart solutions together.
IPD contracts are deployed throughout our services offering and for larger projects, while smaller, less complex,
projects are based on fixed price terms. During the early phase of a project, the relevant customer agrees with us
the design parameters and pricing in detail before the construction contract is signed. The pricing in these types
of contracts is typically based on a total target price with lower margins for us if the price is exceeded and higher
margins if the final price is in line with the target price or below.

###### Order Intake and Order Backlog

Order intake represents the value in terms of sales of projects being processed during any relevant period, plus
changes to existing projects made during that period. We measure our order backlog by business area as of a
single date by calculating the expected net revenues from signed and binding contractual commitments existing
on that date less any net revenue that has already been earned on those contractual commitments up to that date.
Our strong relationships with our customers have contributed to an order backlog of SEK 9,115 million and an
LTM order intake of SEK 12,836 million, respectively, as of March 31, 2023.

The table below sets out the order backlog and order intake for each of our business areas as of and for the twelve
months ended March 31, 2023.

**As of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023**

Order intake .................................................... 4,299 3,376 1,551 1,672 1,937

The largest single contract in our order backlog is Bypass Stockholm worth SEK 520 million where we will be
providing the ventilation solutions for a major tunnel project in Stockholm. The production of the project is
planned to take place between 2020 and 2028. The project is a fixed price project but is subject to indexation and
consists mainly of material and subcontracted work where we have secured back to back agreements to minimize
risk to our calculated margins. In addition, we have four contracts for work on the Malmö Hospital to be produced
between 2019 and 2024, of which two are conducted through joint-ventures. The current collective value of our
joint ventures’ share of these contracts, as well as the separate contracts within Assemblin Electrical, Assemblin
H&S and Assemblin Ventilation, is SEK 324 million.

###### Innovation

As an installation player with a strong focus on digitalization and innovation, we constantly focus on the
development of new methods, materials, products and solutions designed to meet customer needs and increase
our internal efficiency and profitability. In recent years, we successfully deployed numerous innovative solutions
across our technical disciplines and deployed several externally sourced IT upgrades with regard to our internal
organization, including:

  - Assemblin Solar (a concept focused on solar panel installations, targeted at customers who value secure
capacity and in-depth knowledge and experience);

  - Assemblin Charge (a proprietary innovative charging concept employing digital solutions and
installation expertise to enable the charging of electric vehicles at home or in public spaces);

  - EcoGuard Curves (a cloud-based data analytics system linked to sensors and meters, enabling the
analysis of energy consumption data and billing features, and developed by EcoGuard, an entity
integrated as part of the acquisition of Fidelix);

  - EcoSmart (a proprietary artificial intelligence-driven heating and indoor air quality solution based on a
scalable cloud platform);

  - Flow-How (a proprietary machine learning based software application supporting profitability for
property owners through the visualization of building automation data);

  - Assemble, an externally sourced system developed by Autodesk, offering digital progress tracking and
visualization services for installation processes, with the benefit of an effective and transparent
communication with customers (also allowing for follow-ups);

147


-----

  - a set of externally sourced digital operational tools, including modern and easy to use service mobility
tools, efficient digital purchasing portals and digital project follow-up solutions; and

  - a modern and externally sourced IT infrastructure with data warehouse, business intelligence and
reporting capabilities, offering automated reporting for financial and operational key performance
indicators and the rapid tracking of activity at project level, with enabled follow-up functions.

###### Supply and Procurement

We continuously monitor our supplier base in order to ensure diversification, quality, and risk minimization.
Consistent with our objective of providing our customers with competitive prices, we seek to continuously
decrease our total cost of materials while increasing our competitiveness with new suppliers, new purchasing
channels and new products or solutions. To do so, we engage in a two-layered procurement process combining
the central functions of each business area with the individual decision-making of local branches.

###### Our supplier base

We have a diversified and high-quality supplier base, which allows us to avoid dependency on any single supplier.
While our procurement activities are conducted locally, we deploy central procurement functions in each
business area, in order to ensure efficient and disciplined procurement streams and more competitive prices. For
the year ended December 31, 2022, the cost of raw materials and consumables amounted to SEK 4,678 million,
or 36.9 per cent. of our total operating expenses of SEK 12,686 million. Our top supplier accounted for only 11
per cent. of our purchases from our suppliers for the year ending December 31, 2022, while our top ten and
top twenty suppliers accounted for 37 per cent. and 45 per cent., respectively.

We mitigate the risks associated with the availability of materials and cost inflation by ensuring supplier
diversification and utilizing an inflation pass-through mechanism. With regard to materials, we select multiple
material suppliers to avoid temporary shortages and postponement in our installation work. Additionally, where
we can, we pass through the cost of inflation to our customers. We monitor material prices on a continuous basis,
and changes in prices are passed through to our customers on a short notice via our pricing manuals (for services
and small projects) while our multi-year contracts include index clauses.

Our supplier base includes selected original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and wholesalers, which deliver
high-quality installation material nationwide on a timely basis. The largest part of our procurement process
involves direct material purchases from selected framework agreement suppliers. Our key manufacturers and
distributors are monitored and evaluated on a regular basis to control for benefits and risks. In addition, we
require all framework contract suppliers to follow our Code of Conduct (which is added as an appendix to
supplier agreements) and subjects them to routine evaluations. Recorded breaches of our Code of Conduct for
suppliers and serious shortcomings emerging from our routine evaluations may lead to more comprehensive
assessments being performed and, eventually, to the termination of the relevant contractual relationship.
Examples of our wholesale suppliers include Ahlsell, Dahl, Rexel and Elektroskandia, and our OEM suppliers
include Fagerhult, Schneider Electric, Lindab and Siemens. Additionally, we make indirect purchases which
include vehicles, fuel and work uniforms.

We are also increasing the portion of our digital purchases via electronic data interchange (EDI), consequently
reducing the percentage of purchases based on pick-up orders. This policy is being implemented with the aim of
reducing our environmental impact while increasing supply chain coordination.

###### Our material procurement process

Our central procurement functions enable high quality materials at low costs and good availability. The largest
part of our purchases are direct materials such as wires, connections, pipes and connectors. A smaller portion of
purchases relates to vehicles, fuel and work-wear. We implement a group-wide procurement policy and Code of
Conduct for suppliers, which guides all procurement-related activities (including both suppliers of services and
subcontractors, and suppliers of goods, such as manufacturers and wholesalers). At a more functional level, our
procurement of materials comprises two key players: central functions within each business area and local branch
managers. In relation to certain procurement processes, the central functions secure favorable terms with

148


-----

suppliers based on framework agreements, and local branch managers act as the ultimate decision makers. While
certain materials may also be purchased on a local level by the relevant branch (to ensure cost efficiency and
local availability needs), the centralized procurement function in each business area allows the benefit of scale
and the sourcing of high-quality installation materials.

Each business area has its own procurement function which governs and supports branch level procurement
while also negotiating framework agreements with suppliers. The procurement function is responsible for
signing, monitoring and reviewing framework agreements. The assessment of suppliers involves the evaluation
of a range of factors including delivery capacity, warranties, product responsibilities, and prices. The
procurement function within each business area also designates certain supplies as “Assemblin Best Choice” by
collaborating with suppliers and operations to develop and evaluate new materials and products. We aim to offer
the highest quality and sustainable materials and products at a low cost with good availability to customers. In
doing so, we limit our “Assemblin Best Choice” designation to only those suppliers who comply with relevant
laws and requirements, as well as the requirements set out in our Code of Conduct (thereby ensuring that a
supplier selected under “Assemblin Best Choice” also represents our choice from a sustainability perspective).

The actual procurement of materials is then done locally by branch or project managers, who are also responsible
for hiring subcontractors for certain tasks, such as insulation work. A high percentage of our procurement is done
via our digital procurement system, which provides an opportunity to select equivalent materials at a lower cost.
We make continuous efforts across the Group to increase the share of digital procurement and to reduce our
number of cash and carry orders.

###### Sustainability

We aim to act responsibly and to support our customer’s and society’s green transition. To this end, we undertake
several sustainability initiatives to drive our sustainability agenda and to support goals set by national and
international organizations, such as the European Union’s target to be climate-neutral with net-zero greenhouse
gas emissions by 2050. We aim to offer efficient, energy-optimized and adapted installation solutions designed
from a lifecycle perspective, with minimal impact on the environment. This emphasis on sustainability means
that we must be prudent with the resources that we use in our operations, and that we must account for the impacts
created by our service and installation activities. In doing so, we can generate value for customers, employees
and owners, as well as for society as a whole.

In general, our climate footprint is limited. The carbon emissions that our operations generate and can control
(direct emissions) are primarily emissions from transportation (Scope 1 emissions), heating of our premises and
offices (Scope 2 emissions) and business travel (part of Scope 3). Of these categories, emissions from
transportation are the largest. Moreover, our operations give rise to indirect climate impact through the purchase
of goods and services (Scope 3). Direct emissions are easier for us to influence than indirect emissions.

We have as a sustainability target to achieve climate neutrality by 2040, and to reduce scope 1 and 2 emissions
by half by 2030 as compared to emission levels in 2020. Our climate plan is based on clear interim goals
including, among others: (i) the phase-out of fossil fuel through a gradual transition to fossil fuel-free service
vehicles: (ii) the alignment of the Group’s company car policy to EU emission limits; (iii) climate- neutral heating
of offices by 2030; and (iv) increased circularity of developed products and resource efficiency.

Our central sustainability committee reports directly to the Group management team and is tasked with
monitoring legislation, following up on shared sustainability initiatives, conducting materiality analysis & risk
assessments, channeling and disseminating good ideas and preparing documentation for decisions by
management. Additionally, the committee analyses semi-annual sustainability data reported from each business
area in order to monitor progress and develop proposals for initiatives prioritized by our Group management
team. In addition, since 2018, we have published an external annual sustainability report, which will comply with
and report according to the GRI 2021 standards going forwards.

In September 2020, we launched a climate agenda, with the aim of complementing our climate strategy with set
targets as well as a comprehensive plan for gradual transition to carbon-neutral operations. We also monitor the
climate impact of indirect emissions resulting from our procurement activities.

149


-----

Based on our operations, we have identified a number of key sustainability topics, which are categorized from a
stakeholder perspective. These include our responsibilities as an employer, a supplier, an investment and a
corporate citizen.

###### Responsibility as an employer

We believe that committed, satisfied employees produce better results. Therefore, we identified three
sustainability initiatives designed to further our role as a responsible employer that offers stimulating assignments
in a positive, safe and non-discriminating work environment: (i) development and education; (ii) health and
safety; and (iii) human rights, diversity and gender equality.

We are focused on workplace safety. All of our business areas have a target of having zero accidents, and this
goal is supported by our implementation of structured health and safety policies, including extensive
development and training programs.

We also support the principles of the UN Global Compact, adopt a zero tolerance policy for all forms of
discrimination and harassment, and actively support gender equality measures. Within the Group, the Norway
business area is a sponsor for the industry initiative “Ingeborg”, a women's professional network, while our
Swedish operations have supported the “Equality at work” industry initiative since 2017.

###### Responsibility as a supplier

Our aim is to be a responsible and value-adding business partner for our customers. In addition, we strive to be
at the forefront of implementing climate declarations for customers, for example meeting increased climate
declaration demand from builders on building materials. To this end, we recently launched a pilot project in
Norway, whereby customers will be able to measure and monitor the climate impact of materials in buildings
(while also being provided with increased visibility on scope 3 emissions). We seek to create value for our
customers by providing innovative, sustainable installations that improve building functionality and make people
feel comfortable. In our role as a supplier, we have developed three sustainability initiatives intended to
strengthen our relationship with customers: (i) safe, efficient methods and quality (with related guidelines, tools,
instructions and checklists being made available to employees); (ii) innovative, customized and energy-efficient
customer solutions (for example, we recently matched the requirements of various environmental building
certifications such as Leed, Breeam, the Swan and the EU Green Building); and (iii) sourcing and supplier
management (by means of enhanced work coordination through a joint purchasing forum).

###### Responsibility as an investment

We intend to be an attractive investment that delivers stable and profitable growth with controlled risk, adopting
responsible and value-adding strategies. Our sustainability initiatives in this area are focused on (i) producing a
strong yield through stable financial development; (ii) developing policies aimed at measuring risks, ensuring
the strength of our corporate governance and ongoing transparency, and (iii) maintaining sound business ethics.
The above requires the use of sound accounting policies and external auditors, as well as routine reporting of
business and sustainability issues to our owners. Finally, we emphasize the values of our Code of Conduct to all
employees, and hold suppliers to similarly high standards of conduct.

###### Responsibility as a corporate citizen

We intend to be a responsible corporate citizen that conducts sustainable long-term operations with minimal
negative impact on the environment and society. Our main sustainability goal in this category is to minimize our
environmental impact and deliver social benefits to the community. In this capacity, we seek to promote healthy
citizens, create job opportunities and tax revenue and inspire local community involvement, while minimizing
the environmental impact of our operations. For example, during 2020, we strengthened our measures for the
deployment of a more electrified car fleet in our Norwegian and Swedish operations, including targeted actions
relating to our charging facilities. We also contribute through sponsorship and community engagement, mainly
at a local level. For example, the Assemblin Ventilation business area sponsors “Team Rynkeby,” a bicycle project
which supports the battle against childhood cancer by raising funds from sponsors, while the Norway business

150


-----

area continues to support a Zimbabwean village with the deployment of water and energy projects, an endeavor
which has been ongoing since 2017.

###### Acquisitions

We actively monitor the market to identify suitable targets, both from a geographical and technical discipline
standpoint, that we can integrate into our business. Typically, the period from the initial contact to closing an
acquisition ranges from a few months to a few years, and is ultimately dependent on the characteristics of the
individual transaction. Our acquisition process comprises three separate phases: screening, execution and
integration. Potential targets range from smaller accretive investments to material acquisitions.

In recent years, we have also expanded our business, regional presence and capabilities through acquisitions.
Since January 1, 2020, we completed 55 acquisitions, each of which strengthened the Group either
geographically, or within a specific technical discipline, or both. For example, the recent acquisitions of Fidelix,
a Finnish company, offering BMS solutions for commercial buildings to optimize building performance both
from a cost and environmental perspective as well as IMD solutions for residential buildings, and Tom Allen
Senera, a Finnish company offering turn-key energy solutions combining a geothermal component with heat
exchangers, cooling and other energy systems, both strengthened our smart building and automation capabilities.

###### Screening

Our screening of potential acquisition targets is a decentralized process, whereby we leverage our local market
knowledge and relationships of our business areas. Central functions at the Group level support to the business
areas by offering guidance on the Group’s strategic priorities, which is then applied in determining the suitability
of the relevant acquisition. We focus on high quality companies that prioritize profitability over volume, and
have a track record of strong contract execution. Once a suitable acquisition target is identified in accordance
with our strategic guidelines, we perform a preliminary valuation and submit an indicative bid to the target.

###### Execution

Following the identification of a suitable target, we conduct a thorough review, which includes in-depth legal,
financial, operational and commercial due diligence activity. The board of directors of the Group makes the final
decision on all significant acquisitions.

###### Integration

Once we have entered into an acquisition agreement with the target’s owners, we implement a tailored integration
plan prepared in accordance with a proven set of internal guidelines. Central functions at the Group and business
area levels (including functions such as HR, communication and finance) also provide support through the
integration phase. Owners and managers of the target prior to its acquisition will typically be retained as part of
local management to ensure a continued commitment to strong performance.

###### Human Resources and Personnel

 Employees

As of March 31, 2023, we had approximately 6,890 employees located throughout Sweden, Norway and Finland.
The average number of FTE employees for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 and the years ended
December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was 6,695, 6,553, 5,962 and 5,820, respectively. Our employees are divided
between group, business area, regional and branch level, with the vast majority being employed at branch level.

151


-----

The following table shows a breakdown of our average number of FTE employees by business area over the
years 2020, 2021 and 2022 and over the three-month period ended March 31, 2023.

**As of**
**As of 31 December**
**March 31,**
**Full Time Equivalent** **2020** **2021** **2022** **2023**

**By Business area**
Assemblin Electrical 2,783 2,729 2,853 2,919
Assemblin H&S 1,406 1,438 1,455 1,528

Assemblin Ventilation 553 541 554 564

Assemblin Norway 735 790 834 963

Assemblin Finland 319 439 832 893

Group shared functions 24 24 25 24

**Total Average Number of FTE** 5,820 5,962 6,553 6,890
**Employees**

As installations become more complex across buildings, the technical competence of our workforce is
increasingly critical. We focus on incentivizing our staff through measures such as comprehensive training
initiatives including “Assemblin Academy”, an advanced Group-wide set of training programs with a course
offering including, among others, skills development and project management, and a line manager incentive
system. These initiatives have contributed to our high employee retention and satisfaction rates, with an 86
per cent. retention rate in 2022 (compared to 87 per cent. and 85 per cent. for our first and second competitors,
respectively, based on public reporting). Our employee NPS in 2021 was 17 (as compared to 18 in 2019 and
(7) in 2015), which was higher than the industry average of 14. We believe that ongoing training and the
development of our employees and managers is essential to our business.

In addition, we consider employee safety a top priority. Our commitment to safety is underpinned by the
implementation of Group-wide standards for personal safety equipment and by digital incident reporting tools,
enabling simpler reporting and related follow-up by management.

When an installation project requires skills outside our technical fields, we may, from time to time, engage
subcontractors from a highly diversified and locally sourced pool of contractors (both individuals or companies,
as the case may be). Subcontractor payment rates are typically determined on a per-hour basis, however payment
can also be performed as a lump sum in relation to certain tasks (i.e., in the event in which a specific technical
capability is required which we are not providing internally, such as welding).

###### Labor Relations and Pension Issues

Our employees are covered by either a defined contribution pension plan or a defined benefit pension plan. For
more information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We may be required to make
_further contributions to our pension schemes if the value of pension fund assets is not sufficient to cover potential_
_obligations and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”_

We are bound by various collective bargaining agreements in each of the countries in which we operate. For
example, collective bargaining agreements that we have entered into in Sweden have generally a duration of two
to three years, with negotiations for a new period currently on-going. We consider our relationship with our
employees to be good.

###### Information Technology

We believe that a key requirement for efficient operations and satisfactory customer delivery is a stable and
secure IT infrastructure, capable of deploying systems which are tailored to our specific operations.

Over the last few years, we have modernized our IT environment to support our decentralized organization and
use the latest cloud technology. At the Group level, there is a central IT function that, in close collaboration with
the business area IT functions, is responsible for the necessary coordination as well as developing and

152


-----

administering the shared systems. The Group function is also responsible for IT security, which has grown
increasingly relevant in recent years as risks of cyber attacks, data breaches and data losses have increased. IT
units in each business area are responsible for business area-specific systems support. The IT development
projects, which were completed in 2020 and 2021, included a major transition of our IT platform to a modern
platform built on SaaS/cloud systems, following which we are employing cloud data technology in our processes.
We also adopted a sophisticated data structure for driving business intelligence. Furthermore, we implemented
an extensive digital data warehouse and a shared contract database with e-signing procedures. We are also
exploring the possibility of using assembly robots for certain tasks that are heavy and stressful for fitters.

While operating our projects, we conduct large scale communications with clients and contractors based on
information systems such as building innovation modelling (BIM) systems including BIM 360 and Revit.
Assemblin Ventilation has made considerable progress in this work, particularly through its large-scale use of a
BIM-based add-on module that is used by installers to mark off the steps in an installation process so that
production can be followed up in real time, providing a better overview. In all major deliveries, digital customer
platforms are offered for the planning and review of deliveries and financing. We communicate with employees
through an intranet system that is supported by mobile applications. All of our employees have been equipped
with mobile devices, which, in addition to being used in project work, are also employed for time reporting and
other HR matters, including incident management.

With regard to solutions for customers, substantial opportunities exist to optimize the consumption of energy and
resources and/or to improve indoor climate using intelligent, BMS and IMD solutions that use modern sensor
technology (Internet of things, IoT). By adding third-party data and automatic control using AI, the ability to
remotely monitor and control large property portfolios is increased, facilitating optimal operation and low energy
consumption.

###### Insurance

Our Group-wide insurance coverage includes policies for risks associated with our business, including general
liability, contract and property, directors’ and officers’ liability, as well as automobile, buildings and contents and
workers’ compensation policies. We believe that our insurance coverage is consistent with or above industry
standards.

###### Litigation

We provide a complex range of services to a large number of customers. As such, in the ordinary course of
business, we are subject to various administrative, legal and/or regulatory proceedings. On the basis of current
information, we do not expect that the actual claims, lawsuits and other proceedings to which we are subject, or
potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings relating to matters of which we are aware, will ultimately have
a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. We note, however, that the
outcome of legal proceedings is extremely difficult to predict with certainty, and we offer no assurance in this
regard.

The Facilities Agreements also permit each lender to require the mandatory prepayment of all amounts due to
that lender upon:

(a) a “change of control” (which comprises, generally (i) Holdco ceasing to directly own legally and
beneficially 100 per cent. of the issued share capital of the Issuer (subject to certain exceptions set out in
the Facilities Agreements); and (ii), certain scenarios set out under the definition of “Change of Control”

or an affiliate of the lenders becoming (A) unable to fund itself or conduct business in any relevant market

sanctions laws; or (2) become a restricted party, in each case as a result of its performance of, or the
transactions contemplated by the finance documents under the Facilities Agreements).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any ancillary lender or, as the case may be, issuing bank may, as between itself
and the relevant member of the Restricted Group, agree to continue to provide such ancillary facility or, as the
case may be, letter(s) of credit or bank guarantee(s) (with such arrangements continuing on a bilateral basis and
not as part of, or under, the finance documents for any Super Senior Facility and the transaction security for such
Super Senior Facility shall not, following release by the Security Agent, secure any such letter(s) of credit, bank
guarantee(s) or ancillary facility in respect of any claims that arise after such cancellation).

###### Additional Facilities

The Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities Agreement allows for the incurrence of uncommitted “additional
revolving facilities” and “additional guarantee facilities” subject to various terms and conditions set out therein.

In addition, the Pension Guarantee Facility Agreement allows for the incurrence of “additional pension guarantee
facilities” to the extent requested by the pension administrator.

161


-----

The availability, maturity, pricing and other terms of any additional revolving facility, guarantee facility and/or
pension guarantee facilities are those agreed between the Issuer and the relevant lenders of that additional facility,
_provided that_ (i) no additional facility may have a maturity date that is earlier than the maturity date of (as
applicable) the Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities or the Pension Guarantee Facility (or, as applicable in
each case, if at such time the Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities or the Pension Guarantee Facility have
been cancelled in full or would be repaid and cancelled in full after giving effect to the application of proceeds
of the relevant additional revolving facility, guarantee facility and/or pension guarantee facility, any final

relevant additional revolving facility, guarantee facility and/or pension guarantee facility are used to refinance
existing additional revolving facilities, guarantee facilities or pension guarantee facilities), (ii) no additional
pension guarantee facility may be established unless Försäkringsbolaget PRI Pensionsgaranti, ömsesidigt (PRI
Pension Guarantee, Mutual Insurance Company) has requested additional credit support from the Group and (iii)
no member of the Group may provide an additional revolving facility, additional guarantee facility and/or
additional pension guarantee facility.

###### Guarantees

The Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities are guaranteed by the Issuer and Assemblin Group AB and will
also be guaranteed by the same entities that will give guarantees in respect of the Notes.

The Pension Guarantee Facility are guaranteed by the Issuer and Assemblin Group AB and will also be
guaranteed and secured on the same basis as the Notes.

Each Facilities Agreement includes a requirement that, subject to certain carve-outs and exceptions in accordance
with the “agreed security principles” set out in the Facilities Agreements, each member of the Group that is, or
becomes a “material company” (as determined by the reference to the Facilities Agreements) will become a
guarantor under the Facilities Agreements within 90 days of the date of delivery of the relevant annual
consolidated or combined, as applicable, financial statements of the Issuer for the relevant fiscal year.

Furthermore, if on the last day of each financial year of the Issuer (commencing with the first complete financial
year ending December 31, 2023), the guarantors represent less than 80 per cent. of the consolidated earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of the members of the Group (subject to certain exceptions)
(the “Guarantor Coverage Test”), within 90 days of delivery of the annual financial statements for the relevant
financial year (commencing with the first complete financial year ending December 31, 2023), such other
members of the Restricted Group (subject to the agreed security principles and certain other exceptions including
that certain members of the Group may not be required to be or become a guarantor) are required to become
guarantors until the Guarantor Coverage Test is satisfied (to be calculated as if such additional guarantors had
been guarantors on the last day of the relevant financial year).

###### Security

The Super Senior Facilities will be secured by security interests granted over the same property and assets which
secure the Notes, and are expected to be secured by the Post-Closing Collateral within 90 days of the Issue Date
(subject to the agreed security principles set out in the Facilities Agreements), as further described under
“Description of the Notes—Security.”

Each holding company of any “material company” (provided that such holding company is a member of the
Restricted Group (in each case, non wholly-owned members of the Group only to the extent there are no
applicable restrictions)) which becomes a guarantor under any Super Senior Facility is required (subject to the
agreed security principles set out in the Facilities Agreements) to grant security over the shares it holds in such
material company in favor of the Security Agent. Any Subordinated Shareholder Funding is required to be made
subject to security and to constitute Shareholder Liabilities (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement).

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, proceeds from the enforcement of the transaction security for
the Super Senior Facilities (whether or not shared with the holders of the Notes or the Guarantee Original
Lenders) will be required to be applied to repay indebtedness outstanding under:

162


-----

(a) the Pension Guarantee Facility in priority to the Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities, hedging
obligations and the Notes; and

(b) the Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities, as well as certain hedging obligations, in priority to the
Notes.

###### Representations and Warranties

The Facilities Agreements contain certain customary representations and warranties (subject to certain customary
materiality, actual knowledge and other qualifications, exceptions and baskets, and with certain representations
and warranties being repeated), including without limitations: (i) status; (ii) binding obligations; (iii) non-conflict
with other obligations; (iv) power and authority; (v) validity and admissibility in evidence; (vi) governing law
and enforcement; (vii) no insolvency; (viii) no proceedings pending or threatened; (ix) no events of default; (x)

sanctions and anti-corruption laws; (xix) deduction of tax; (xx) no breach of laws; (xxi) good title to assets;(xxii)
financial statements and (xxiii) no filing or stamp taxes.

###### Covenants

The Facilities Agreements contain certain of the same incurrence covenants and related definitions (with certain
adjustments) that apply to the Notes as included under the caption “Description of the Notes—Certain
_Covenants.”_

In addition, the Facilities Agreements also contain certain affirmative and negative covenants, and the Revolving
Credit and Guarantee Facilities Agreement also contains a financial covenant. Set forth below is a brief
description of such covenants, all of which are subject to customary materiality, actual knowledge or other
qualifications, exceptions and baskets.

###### Affirmative Covenants

The affirmative covenants include, among others: (i) providing certain financial information in respect of the
Restricted Group, including annual audited and quarterly financial statements, an annual budget and compliance
certificates; (ii) authorizations, (iii) compliance with laws; (iv) payment of taxes; (v) maintenance of pari passu
ranking of the Super Senior Facilities; (vi) compliance with environmental permits and laws; (vii) compliance
with sanctions and anti-corruption laws; (viii) maintenance of the Guarantor Coverage Test; (ix) further assurance
provisions; and (x) maintenance of pension schemes of the Group; (xi) maintenance of insurances of the Group.

###### Negative Covenants

The negative covenants in the Super Senior Facilities are substantially the same as the negative covenants that
are in the Indenture.

Certain of the incurrence covenants under the Facilities Agreements may be suspended upon (i) the occurrence
of an “initial public offering” (that does not result in a “change of control”) and the achievement of a
“consolidated net leverage ratio” of the Restricted Group is equal to or less than 3.75:1.00 (generally, pro forma
for any prepayment of the Facilities from the proceeds of such initial public offering) or (ii) a member of the
Restricted Group, the Parent or a holding company of the Group having achieved an investment grade status
(Baa3/BBB- or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group).

The Facilities Agreements also contain a “notes purchase condition” covenant, which provides, subject to certain
exceptions set out in the Facilities Agreements, that the Issuer may not, and shall procure that no other member
of the Restricted Group will, prepay, purchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire for value any of the principal
amount of the Notes prior to the scheduled repayment date. The exceptions to such covenant include, inter alia:
(i) notes purchases funded with certain permitted indebtedness under the Facilities Agreement; (ii) (provided no
“event of default” under any Super Senior Facility is continuing or would result from such note purchase) where
the “consolidated net leverage ratio” for the Restricted Group would be equal to or less than 4.00:1.00 at the time
such note purchase is contractually committed (pro forma to take account of the relevant notes purchase); (iii)

163


-----

(provided no event of default under any Super Senior Facility is continuing or would result from such note
purchase) note purchases that do not exceed 50 per cent. of the aggregate face value of the Notes in existence at
the Issue Date or incurred afterwards (and any permitted refinancing thereof); or (iv) the Revolving Credit
Facility or Pension Guarantee Facility (as applicable) is cancelled (and if applicable prepaid) in the same or
greater proportion as the proportion of the note purchase to the aggregate face value of the Notes then
outstanding.

###### Financial Covenant

The Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities Agreement requires the Issuer to comply with a consolidated
“senior secured net leverage” financial covenant.” The financial covenant will be tested quarterly on a rolling
basis, generally, subject to (i) the first test date falling on the date that is the end of the second fiscal quarter date
after the Issue Date and (ii) the Revolving Credit Facility being at least 40 per cent. cash drawn on the relevant
test date. The finance parties under the Pension Guarantee Facility Agreement do not benefit from the financial
covenant.

The Issuer shall be permitted to prevent or cure breaches of the financial covenant by applying a “cure” amount
(generally, amounts received by the Issuer in cash pursuant to any new equity or permitted shareholder
subordinated debt), including as if “consolidated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization”
had been reduced by such amount. There shall be no requirement to apply any such cure amount in prepayment
of the Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities. No more than four different cure amounts may be taken into
account prior to the original termination date of the Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities Agreement and
cure amounts in consecutive financial quarters will not be permitted.

###### Events of Default

The Facilities Agreements provide for some of the same events of default, with certain adjustments, as those
applicable for the Notes as set forth in the section entitled “Description of the Notes—Events of Default.” In
addition, the Super Senior Facilities provide for certain customary events of default, all of which are subject to
customary materiality, legal reservations, perfection requirements and other qualifications, exceptions, baskets
and/or grace periods, as appropriate, comprising without limitation: (i) breach of the financial covenant subject
to possibilities to cure the financial covenant breach; (ii) representations or warranties found to be untrue or
misleading when made or deemed repeated subject to a 20 business day grace period; (iii) unlawfulness and
invalidity subject to a 20 business day grace period; (iv) failure to comply with a material term of the Intercreditor
Agreement subject to a 20 business day grace period; and (v) repudiation and rescission of the finance documents
subject to a 20 business day grace period.

No default or event of default (other than a non-payment default under the Pension Guarantee Facility
Agreement) shall be deemed to have occurred or be continuing under the Pension Guarantee Facility Agreement
unless a corresponding default or event of default has occurred and is continuing under the Revolving Credit and
Guarantee Facilities Agreement (or any replacement facility) for as long as any such agreement remains in force
and (ii) any such default or event of default (other than in relation to non-payment default or event of default
under the Pension Guarantee Facility Agreement) of the Pension Guarantee Agreement shall be continuing for
as long as the corresponding default or event of default is continuing under the Revolving Credit and Guarantee
Facilities Agreement (or any replacement facility) for as long as any such agreement remain in force.

###### Governing Law

The Facilities Agreements are governed by English law, provided that the events of default, incurrence covenants
and related definitions for the Notes included (with certain adjustments) in the Facilities Agreements are
interpreted in accordance with the law of the State of New York.

###### Intercreditor Agreement

To establish the relative rights of certain of our creditors under certain of our financing arrangements, the Issuer,
the immediate subsidiary of the Issuer and the immediate holding company to the Issuer (the “Original
Shareholder Creditor”) will have entered into an intercreditor agreement (the “Intercreditor Agreement”) on

164


-----

the Issue Date, together with the RCF Agent, the Pension Guarantee Facility Agent, the Original Lenders and the
Mandated Lead Arrangers, as well as the Trustee for the holders of the Notes (the “Senior Secured Notes
**Trustee”) and the Security Agent.**

By accepting a Note, the relevant holder thereof shall be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the terms and
conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement and shall be deemed to have authorized the Trustee to enter into the
Intercreditor Agreement on its behalf as Senior Secured Notes Trustee.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions, among others, that will be contained in the
Intercreditor Agreement and which relate to the rights and obligations of the holders of the Notes. It does not
restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety. As such, you are urged to read the Intercreditor Agreement
because it, and not the description that follows, defines certain rights of the holders of the Notes.

Unless expressly stated otherwise in the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of a conflict between the terms of
the Facilities Agreements, the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, the provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement will prevail.

###### Overview

The Intercreditor Agreement will set out, among other things:

- the relative ranking of certain debt of the Issuer and its “restricted subsidiaries” (together, the “Group”)
in respect of “Pension Guarantee Facility Liabilities,” “RCF and Guarantee Facilities Liabilities,”
“Credit Facility Liabilities,” “Senior Secured Notes Liabilities,” “Future Pari Passu Debt
**Liabilities,” “Super Senior Hedging Liabilities,” “Pari Passu Hedging Liabilities” and “Future**
**Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities” (each as defined below);**

- the relative ranking of certain security granted by certain members of the Group for the benefit of certain
creditors under certain of our financing arrangements;

- when payments can be made in respect of certain indebtedness of the Group;

- when enforcement action (including acceleration and/or demand for payment and certain similar actions)
(“Enforcement Action”) can be taken in respect of the “Transaction Security” (as defined below);

- the requirement to turnover amounts received from enforcement of the Transaction Security and certain
guarantees provided by certain members of the Group;

- when the Transaction Security and guarantee(s) issued by certain members of the Group are released to
permit an enforcement sale;

- the circumstances under which creditors’ claims (including the claims of holders of the Notes against the
Issuer) might be required to be transferred to third parties or released to assist in enforcement; and

- the order for applying proceeds from the enforcement of the Transaction Security, certain guarantees and
other amounts received by the Security Agent.

###### Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness

The Intercreditor Agreement will contain customary provisions regulating certain additional indebtedness
permitted to be incurred by members of the Group and which is contemplated to be secured by the documents
creating security (including the Collateral) (the “Transaction Security”) granted by certain members of the
Group (together, the “Transaction Security Documents”).

Such additional indebtedness may either, with respect to the Transaction Security (and the proceeds thereof): (i)
be in the form of loans, credit or debt facilities or notes (among other things) and have equivalent rights to the
rights of the holders of the Notes under the Intercreditor Agreement, in which case it will vote in, and share in
the proceeds of, enforcement of the Transaction Security with the same class of creditors as the holders of Notes
(such indebtedness, “Future Pari Passu Debt” and, the holders of such indebtedness, “Future Pari Passu Debt
**Creditors”); (ii) be in the form of a “credit facility” ranking senior to the liabilities in respect of the Notes with**

respect to the proceeds of enforcement of the Transaction Security, in which case it will vote in, and share in the
proceeds of, enforcement of Transaction Security with the lenders under the Revolving Credit and Guarantee
Facilities and any “Super Senior Hedging Agreements” (as defined below) (such additional credit facilities,
solely for the purposes of this description of the Intercreditor Agreement, the “Credit Facilities” and, the lenders
of such indebtedness, the “Additional Credit Facility Lenders”); (iii) be in the form of a “pension guarantee
facility” ranking senior to the liabilities in respect of the Super Senior Lenders with respect to the proceeds of
enforcement of the Transaction Security, in which case it will vote in, and share in the proceeds of, enforcement
of Transaction Security with the lenders under the Pension Facilities (such additional pension guarantee facilities,
solely for the purposes of this description of the Intercreditor Agreement, the “Additional Pension Facilities”
and, the lenders of such indebtedness, the “Additional Pension Guarantee Facility Lenders”); or (iv) to the
extent that it benefits from Transaction Security, be in the form of loans, credit or debt facilities or notes (among
other things) and rank junior to the liabilities in respect of the Notes, in which case it will share in the proceeds
of enforcement of the Transaction Security expressed to secure it on a junior basis to the holders of the Notes
(such indebtedness, “Future Senior Subordinated Debt,” and the lenders or holders of such indebtedness, the
“Future Senior Subordinated Creditors”).

###### Hedging Transactions

The Intercreditor Agreement will contain provisions that permit certain members of the Group to enter into
hedging agreements with certain hedge counterparties, which may also be secured by the Transaction Security.

The hedging agreements may either, with respect to the Transaction Security (and the proceeds thereof): (i) be
secured on a senior basis to the liabilities in respect of the Notes with respect to the proceeds of enforcement of
the Transaction Security, in which case it will vote in, and share in the proceeds of, enforcement of the
Transaction Security with the lenders and creditors under the Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities (such
hedging agreements, the “Super Senior Hedging Agreements,” and, the hedge counterparties in respect thereof,
the “Super Senior Hedging Banks”); or (ii) have equivalent rights to the rights of the holders of the Notes under
the Intercreditor Agreement, in which case it will vote in, and share in the proceeds of, enforcement of the
Transaction Security with the same class of creditors as the holders of Notes and the holders of any Future Pari
Passu Debt (such hedging agreements, the “Pari Passu Hedging Agreements,” and, the hedge counterparties in
respect thereof, the “Pari Passu Hedging Banks” and, together with the Super Senior Hedging Banks, the
“Hedging Banks”).

###### Intra-Group Debt and Shareholder Debt

None of the Issuer, any of its restricted subsidiaries or any shareholder of a member of the Group which is not
otherwise party to (1) a document creating security in favor of any of the “Super Super Senior Creditors” (as
defined below), “Super Senior Creditors” (as defined below), “Senior Secured Creditors” (as defined below)
or the Future Senior Subordinated Creditors or (2) the debt documents thereby secured, will be party to the
Intercreditor Agreement save for: (i) the immediate shareholder of the Issuer (and any other person who accedes
or otherwise becomes party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a shareholder creditor) in respect of any existing
or future loan made to the Issuer or any of its restricted subsidiaries (each a “Shareholder Creditor,” and each
such loan, the “Shareholder Debt Liabilities”); and (ii) certain members of the Group that lend (each an
“Intragroup Lender”) to certain other members of the Group that will accede or otherwise become a party to
the Intercreditor Agreement with respect to such loan or indebtedness which is (when aggregated with all other
loans or indebtedness between such member of the Group and such other member of the Group) in an amount in
excess of €20 million and, in the case of each such loan or indebtedness, (or will be) outstanding for more than
twelve months (the “Intra-Group Liabilities”) (each an “Obligor” and, together, the “Obligors”).

The Intercreditor Agreement will contain subordination provisions relating to any Intra-Group Liabilities as well
as the Shareholder Debt Liabilities. However, Obligors will not be prohibited from making payments in respect
of any Intra-Group Liabilities until an “acceleration event” has occurred and is continuing under any of the
Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities Agreement, the Indenture, any Credit Facility, any Future Pari Passu
Debt or any Future Senior Subordinated Debt.

166

###### Security Agent

There will be a single security agent appointed to act at all times on behalf of (i) the lenders under the Pension
Guarantee Facility Agreement (together, the “Pension Guarantee Lenders”) and any Additional Pension
Guarantee Facility Lenders (together, the “Super Super Senior Creditors”), (ii) the lenders under the Revolving
Credit and Guarantee Facilities and any Additional Credit Facility Lender (together, the “RCF and Guarantee
**Lenders”), any Super Senior Hedging Banks and any Additional Credit Facility Lenders (together, the “Super**
**Senior Creditors”), (ii) the holders of the Notes, any Pari Passu Hedging Banks and any Future Pari Passu Debt**
Creditors (collectively, the “Senior Secured Creditors” and, together with the Super Senior Creditors and the
Super Super Senior Creditors, the “Senior Creditors,” and the debt owing to the Senior Creditors, the “Senior
**Debt”) and (iii) any Future Senior Subordinated Creditors.**

###### Ranking and Priority

 Priority of Indebtedness

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the liabilities of the Obligors, as the case may be, in respect of the
Pension Facilities (the “Pension Guarantee Facility Liabilities”) and any Additional Pension Facilities
(together with the Pension Guarantee Facility Liabilities, the “Super Super Senior Liabilities”), the Revolving
Credit and Guarantee Facilities (the “RCF and Guarantee Facilities Liabilities”), any Credit Facilities (the
“Credit Facility Liabilities”), the Notes and any additional notes issued from time to time under the Indenture
(together, the “Senior Secured Notes,” and the liabilities in respect thereof, the “Senior Secured Notes
**Liabilities”), the Future Pari Passu Debt (the “Future Pari Passu Debt Liabilities”), the amounts owing to the**
Super Senior Hedging Banks under the Super Senior Hedging Agreements (the “Super Senior Hedging
**Liabilities” and, together with the RCF and Guarantee Facilities Liabilities and the Credit Facility Liabilities,**
the “Super Senior Liabilities”) and the amounts owing to the Pari Passu Hedging Banks under the Pari Passu
Hedging Agreements (the “Pari Passu Hedging Liabilities” and, together with the Super Senior Hedging
Liabilities, the “Hedging Liabilities”), certain customary costs and expenses of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee
(the “Senior Secured Trustee Liabilities”), amounts owing to the Security Agent, and amounts owing to the
representatives for the creditors under the Super Super Senior Liabilities, the RCF and Guarantee Facilities
Liabilities, the Credit Facility Liabilities, the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities and the Pari Passu Hedging
Liabilities, respectively, ranks equally (without preference among them) in right and priority of payment and in
priority to the liabilities of the Obligors, as the case may be, in respect of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt
(the “Future Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities”), the Intra-Group Liabilities and the Shareholder Debt
Liabilities.

The Future Senior Subordinated Debt ranks in priority to the Intra-Group Liabilities and the Shareholder Debt
Liabilities.

The Intercreditor Agreement will not rank any of liabilities and/or obligations owed any person who is not the
Issuer or a restricted subsidiary of the Issuer.

###### Priority of Transaction Security

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Transaction Security created pursuant to the Transaction
Security Documents shall rank and secure the following liabilities in the following order (but only, in each case,
to the extent that such Transaction Security is expressed to secure those liabilities):

- **first, pari passu between themselves and without any preference between them, the Super Super Senior**
Liabilities, the RCF and Guarantee Facilities Liabilities, the Credit Facility Liabilities, the Super Senior
Hedging Liabilities, the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the Future Pari Passu Debt Liabilities, certain
customary costs and expenses of the Senior Secured Trustee and the Pari Passu Hedging Liabilities; and

- **second,** _pari passu_ between themselves and without any preference between them, the Future Senior
Subordinated Debt Liabilities.

The proceeds from the enforcement of the Transaction Security are to be applied as described below under the
caption “—Application of Proceeds/Waterfall.”

167


-----

###### Intra-Group Liabilities and Shareholder Debt Liabilities

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Intra-Group Liabilities and the Shareholder Debt Liabilities
are postponed and subordinated to the liabilities owed by the Obligors to the Super Super Senior Creditors, the
Super Senior Creditors, the Senior Secured Creditors and the Future Senior Subordinated Creditors (collectively,
the “Primary Creditors”).

###### Restrictions on Payments

 Super Super Senior Creditors, Super Senior Creditors and Senior Secured Creditors

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Obligors may make payments in respect of the Super Super
Senior Liabilities, RCF and Guarantee Facilities Liabilities, the Credit Facility Liabilities, the Senior Secured
Notes Liabilities and the Future Pari Passu Debt Liabilities, respectively, at any time in accordance with their
respective terms.

###### Future Senior Subordinated Creditors

Prior to the date of discharge of all Senior Debt (the “Senior Debt Discharge Date”), except with the prior
consent of an “Instructing Group” (as defined below), neither the Issuer nor any member of the Group may
make payments in respect of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities without the consent of the
“Relevant Representative” (as defined below) except for the following:

(1) if:

(a) the payment is:

(i) any of the principal or interest (including capitalized interest and default interest) amount

Subordinated Debt Liabilities (provided that (x) the scheduled maturity date of such Future
Senior Subordinated Debt is, at the first date of incurrence of such Future Senior
Subordinated Debt, no earlier than the date falling six months after the original scheduled

being acknowledged that such Future Senior Subordinated Debt may have customary
optional redemption, change of control, asset sale and/or other customary mandatory
redemption provisions) and (y) such maturity date is no earlier than that contained in the
relevant Future Senior Subordinated Debt documents as of the first date of incurrence of
any Future Senior Subordinated Debt); or

(ii) any other amount in respect of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities which is not

Subordinated Debt Liabilities accrued due and payable in cash in accordance with the terms
of the relevant debt documents for the Future Senior Subordinated Debt (together, the
“Future Senior Subordinated Debt Documents”), additional amounts payable as a result of

(3) the payment is a “Permitted Post-Payment Blockage Payment” (as defined below).

(4) the payment is in respect of costs, commissions, taxes, consent fees and expenses incurred in respect of
(or reasonably incidental to) the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Documents (including in relation to
any reporting or listing requirements under the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Documents); or

(or reasonably incidental to) any refinancing of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt in compliance with
the Intercreditor Agreement, the Pension Guarantee Facility Agreement, any Additional Pension Facilities
finance arrangement, the Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities Agreement and any Credit Facility
finance agreement, the Indenture and any Future Pari Passu Debt finance agreement;

(6) the payment is in respect of certain customary costs and expenses payable to a “Future Senior

On or after the Senior Debt Discharge Date, the Obligors may make payments to the Future Senior Subordinated
Creditors in respect of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities in accordance with the Future Senior
Subordinated Debt Documents.

###### Payment Block—Future Senior Subordinated Debt

Prior to the Senior Debt Discharge Date, if a Senior Debt Payment Default has occurred and is continuing, all
payments in respect of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities (other than any payment consented to by
the “Majority Super Super Senior Creditors,” the “Majority Super Senior Creditors” and the “Majority
**Senior Secured Creditors” (each as defined below) and certain specified exceptions) are suspended.**

Prior to the Senior Debt Discharge Date, if an event of default (other than a Senior Debt Payment Default) under
the finance documents in respect of the Senior Debt (a “Senior Default”) has occurred and is continuing, and
either the Pension Guarantee Facility Agent, the creditor representative for any Pension Guarantee Facility, the
RCF Agent, the creditor representative for any Credit Facility (together the “Senior Agents” and each a “Senior
**Agent”), the Senior Secured Notes Trustee or a creditor representative of Future Pari Passu Debt (as the case**
may be) (each a “Relevant Representative”) has delivered a Payment Blockage Notice to the Issuer, the Security
Agent and creditor representative of the Future Senior Subordinated Creditors (the “Future Senior
**Subordinated Debt Representative”), all payments in respect of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt**
Liabilities (other than those consented to by the Majority Super Super Senior Creditors, Majority Super Senior
Creditors and Majority Senior Secured Creditors and certain specified exceptions) are suspended until the earliest
of:

(1) the date on which there is a waiver, remedy or cure of such Senior Default in accordance with the relevant
finance documents;

(2) the date on which a default under the Future Senior Subordinated Debt occurs for failure to pay principal
at the original scheduled maturity of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt;

(3) the date falling 179 days after the receipt by the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Representative of the
Payment Blockage Notice;

169


-----

(4) if a Future Senior Subordinated Debt Standstill Period (as defined below) is in effect at any time after
delivery of a Payment Blockage Notice, the date on which that Standstill Period expires;

(5) the date on which the relevant Senior Default is no longer continuing and, if the relevant Senior Debt has
been accelerated, such acceleration has been rescinded (and if such acceleration consisted solely of
declaring the relevant debt payable on demand such rescission can be effected by the relevant majority
creditors in respect of the relevant debt);

(6) the date on which the Relevant Representative which issued the Payment Blockage Notice (and, if at such
time a Senior Default is continuing (other than in relation to the Senior Debt in respect of which such
notice was given), the Relevant Representative(s) in respect of that other Senior Debt) delivers a notice
to the Issuer, the Security Agent and the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Representative cancelling that
Payment Blockage Notice;

(7) the Senior Debt Discharge Date; and

(8) the date on which the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Representative or the Security Agent takes any
Enforcement Action which it is permitted to take in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.

Unless the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Representative waives this requirement: (i) no new Payment
Blockage Notice may be served by a Relevant Representative unless 360 days have elapsed since the delivery of
the immediately prior Payment Blockage Notice; and (ii) no Payment Blockage Notice may be served in reliance
on a Senior Default more than 60 days after the date that the Relevant Representative received notice of that
Senior Default.

The Relevant Representative may only serve one Payment Blockage Notice with respect to the same event or set
of circumstances. Subject to the immediately preceding paragraph, this shall not affect the right of the Relevant
Representatives to issue a Payment Blockage Notice in respect of any other event or set of circumstances.

No Payment Blockage Notice may be served by a Relevant Representative in respect of a Senior Default which
had been notified to each of them at the time at which an earlier Payment Blockage Notice was issued.

###### Cure of Payment Block—Future Senior Subordinated Creditors

If:

(a) at any time following the issue of a Payment Blockage Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Debt Payment
Default, that Payment Blockage Notice ceases to be outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the Senior
Debt Payment Default ceases to be continuing; and

(b) the relevant Obligor then promptly pays to the Future Senior Subordinated Creditors an amount equal to
any payments which had accrued under any Future Senior Subordinated Debt Documents and which
would have otherwise been entitled to make but for that Payment Blockage Notice or Senior Debt
Payment Default (a “Permitted Post-Payment Blockage Payment”), then any event of default which
may have occurred as a result of that suspension of payments shall be waived and any “Future Senior
**Subordinated Debt Enforcement Notice” (as defined below) which may have been issued as a result of**
that event of default shall be waived, in each case without any further action being required on the part of
the Future Senior Subordinated Creditors.

###### Enforcement Action

 Permitted enforcement by Future Senior Subordinated Creditors

Prior to the Senior Debt Discharge Date, neither the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Representative nor the
Future Senior Subordinated Creditors may take or require the taking of an Enforcement Action with respect to
the Future Senior Subordinated Debt without the prior consent of or as required by an “Instructing Group” (as
defined below), except if:

170


-----

(1) an event of default has occurred under a Future Senior Subordinated Debt finance agreement resulting
from failure to pay the principal amount of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities at final

(2)

(a) an event of default under a Future Senior Subordinated Debt finance agreement is continuing (the
“Relevant Future Senior Subordinated Debt Event of Default”);

(b) each Relevant Representative has received notice of the Relevant Future Senior Subordinated Debt
Event of Default from the relevant Future Senior Subordinated Debt Representative;

(c) a Future Senior Subordinated Debt Standstill Period (as defined below) has expired; and

(d) the Relevant Future Senior Subordinated Debt Event of Default is continuing at the end of the
relevant Standstill Period,

_provided that in the case of paragraph (2) above only, no such Enforcement Action may be taken if the Security_
Agent is acting in accordance with the instructions of the Instructing Group to take steps for Enforcement and
such proposed Enforcement Action in relation to the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Documents might
reasonably be likely to adversely affect such Enforcement Action by the Security Agent.

###### Standstill on enforcement by Future Senior Subordinated Creditors

A “Future Senior Subordinated Standstill Period” shall mean the period starting on the date that the Future
Senior Subordinated Debt Representative serves an enforcement notice (a “Future Senior Subordinated Debt
**Enforcement Notice”) on the Relevant Representatives until the earliest of:**

(a) 179 days after such date;

(b) the date on which the Security Agent takes any Enforcement Action, provided that (i) if the Future Senior
Subordinated Standstill Period ends pursuant to this paragraph (b), the Future Senior Subordinated
Creditors may only take the same Enforcement Action against the same entity as is taken by the Security
Agent and may not take any other action against any other member of the Group and (ii) Enforcement
Action, for the purposes of this paragraph (b), shall not include action taken to preserve or protect any
security as opposed to realize it;

(c) the date on which an insolvency event occurs in respect of a particular Obligor owing Future Senior
Subordinated Debt Liabilities and against whom Enforcement Action is to be taken;

date that the current Future Senior Subordinated Standstill Period commenced (other than as a result of a
cure, waiver or other permitted remedy thereof).

A “Pension Guarantee Standstill Period” shall mean the period starting on the date that the creditor
representative for any Pension Guarantee Facility serves an enforcement notice on the Relevant Representatives
until the earliest of:

(a) 120 days if they take enforcement action due to a payment default;

(b) 150 days if they take enforcement action due to any other event of default;

(c) the Majority Super Senior Secured Creditors and the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have given their
prior consent; or

171


-----

(d) the date on which an insolvency event occurs in respect of a particular Obligor owing Super Super Senior
Liabilities and against whom Enforcement Action is to be taken.

###### Composition of the instructing creditor groups

The Intercreditor Agreement will generally provide that the Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the
Transaction Security unless instructed otherwise by an Instructing Group. Each of the creditor groups referred to
below under this caption constitute an “Instructing Group” in relation to instructions with respect to any
Enforcement.

Prior to the date upon which all amounts (actual or contingent) owing under the (a) Revolving Credit and
Guarantee Facility and each other Credit Facility are fully discharged and paid in full and all commitments
thereunder are irrevocably cancelled (such date, the “RCF/Credit/Guarantee Facility Discharge Date”), (b)
the Pension Guarantee Facility and each other Additional Pension Guarantee Facility are fully discharged and
paid in full and all commitments thereunder are irrevocably cancelled (such date, the “Pension Guarantee
**Facility Discharge Date”) and (c) Super Senior Hedging Liabilities are fully discharged and paid in full (“Super**
**Senior Hedging Discharge Date”), in relation to instructions with respect to any Enforcement, the Security**
Agent will act on the instructions of, generally:

(1) the Pension Guarantee Lenders and any Additional Pension Guarantee Facility Lenders whose credit

participations represent more than 66 2⁄3 per cent. of the aggregate credit participations of all Pension
Guarantee Lenders and Additional Pension Guarantee Facility Lenders (the “Majority Super Super
**Senior Creditors”);**

(2) the RCF and Guarantee Lenders, the Additional Credit Facility Lenders and the Super Senior Hedging
Banks whose credit participations represent more than 50 per cent. of the aggregate credit participations
of all RCF and Guarantee Lenders, Additional Credit Facility Lenders and Super Senior Hedging Banks
(the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”); and/or

(3) the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, the Future Pari Passu Debt Creditors and the Pari Passu Hedging
Banks whose aggregate credit participations represent more than 50 per cent. of the aggregate credit
participations of all holders of Senior Secured Notes, Future Pari Passu Debt Creditors and Pari Passu
Hedging Banks (the “Majority Senior Secured Creditors”),

in each case subject to a consultation period referred to under the caption “—Consultation” below and provided
that such instructions are consistent with the “Security Enforcement Principles” (as defined below) as generally
described below under the caption “—Security Enforcement Principles”

Following the RCF/Credit/Guarantee Facility Discharge Date, the Pension Guarantee Facility Discharge Date
and the Super Senior Hedging Discharge Date but prior to the Senior Debt Discharge Date, the Security Agent
will act on the instructions of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors which would, solely for this purpose, include
all Super Senior Hedging Banks (if any).

Following the Senior Debt Discharge Date, the Security Agent will act on the instructions of the “Majority Senior
Subordinated Creditors” (being, at any time, those Future Senior Subordinated Creditors whose credit
participations at that time aggregate more than 50 per cent. of the aggregate credit participations of all Future
Senior Subordinated Creditors).

###### Consultation

Prior to giving any instructions to the Security Agent to commence enforcement of all or part of the Transaction
Security and/or the requesting of a “distressed disposal” and/or the release or disposal of claims or Transaction
Security on a distressed disposal (each an “Enforcement”), the relevant creditor representative(s) of the Majority
Super Super Senior Creditors, the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors shall
first notify the Security Agent and the creditor representative for each of the, Super Super Senior Creditors, the
Super Senior Creditors and each of the Senior Secured Creditors that the applicable Transaction Security has
become enforceable.

172


-----

As soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of such a notice instructing the Security Agent to solicit
instructions to enforce the Transaction Security or take any other Enforcement Action given by (subject to the
Super Super Senior Creditors being entitled to take Enforcement Actions as generally described below under the
caption “—Standstill on enforcement by Super Super Senior Creditors”) the Majority Super Super Senior
Creditors, the Majority Super Senior Creditors and/or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (as the case may
be), the Security Agent shall distribute such notice to the relevant addressees promptly upon receipt, following
which, each Senior Agent (acting on the instructions of the Majority Super Senior Creditors and/or the Majority
Super Super Senior Creditors (as the case may be)), the Senior Secured Notes Trustee and the creditor
representative(s) of the Future Pari Passu Debt Creditors will consult in good faith with each other and the
Security Agent for a period of 15 days from the date such notice is received by such persons (or such shorter
period as the relevant parties may agree) (the “Consultation Period”) with a view to coordinating the
instructions to be given by an Instructing Group and agreeing an enforcement strategy.

Generally, no such consultation shall be required (and an Instructing Group shall be entitled to give any
instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security or take any other Enforcement Action prior
to the end of the Consultation Period, in each case provided such instructions comply with the Security
Enforcement Principles (“Qualifying Instructions”)) where:

(a) the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an insolvency event affecting the Original
Shareholder Creditor, the Issuer or any Obligor (owing liabilities to any Primary Creditor or the Issuer)
or any “significant subsidiary” (as applicable) (each a “Relevant Company”); or

(b) the Majority Super Super Senior Creditors, the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior
Secured Creditors determine in good faith (and notify the creditor representatives of each of the other
Pension Guarantee Lenders, the Additional Pension Guarantee Facility Lenders, RCF and Guarantee
Lenders, Additional Credit Facility Lenders, Super Senior Hedging Banks, the holders of the Senior
Secured Notes, the Future Pari Passu Debt Creditors and the Security Agent) that any delay caused by
such consultation could reasonably be expected to reduce the amount likely to be realized to a level such
that (following application thereof in accordance with the “Payments Waterfall” (as defined below)
described below under the caption “—Application of Proceeds/Waterfall”) Super Super Senior Liabilities
and the Super Senior Liabilities would not be discharged in full and in this case any instructions is limited
to those necessary to protect or preserve the interests of the Senior Secured Creditors on behalf of which
the relevant Instructing Group is acting and the Security Agent shall act in accordance with the instructions
first received.

If, following the Consultation Period, the Majority Super Super Senior Creditors, the Majority Super Senior
Creditors and/or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have agreed on an enforcement strategy, the Security
Agent shall be instructed to implement the same.

Subject to the paragraph below, in the event that conflicting instructions are received from either Instructing
Group by the end of (or following) the Consultation Period, the Security Agent shall enforce the Transaction
Security and/or refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security and/or take the relevant other Enforcement
Action in accordance with the instructions provided by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, provided that any
such instructions are Qualifying Instructions and the terms of all instructions received by the Majority Super
Super Senior Creditors and/or Majority Super Senior Creditors during the Consultation Period shall be deemed
revoked.

If, prior to the:

(a) RCF/Credit/Guarantee Facility Discharge Date, either (x) the Super Senior Liabilities have not been
repaid in full within six months of the end of the Consultation Period, (y) the Security Agent has not
commenced any Enforcement (or any transaction in lieu) or other Enforcement Action within three
months of the end of the Consultation Period or (z) at any time (whether before or after the end of the
Consultation Period) an insolvency event has occurred with respect to a Relevant Company and the
Security Agent has not commenced any Enforcement (or any transaction in lieu) or other Enforcement

173


-----

Action at that time with respect to such Relevant Company, then, in relation to instructions with respect
to any Enforcement, the Security Agent shall thereafter follow any instructions that are subsequently given
by the Majority Super Senior Creditors (in each case provided the same are Qualifying Instructions) to
the exclusion of those given by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors and the Super Super Senior
Creditors (to the extent conflicting with any instructions previously given by the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors and the Super Super Senior Creditors); and

(b) Pension Guarantee Facility Discharge Date, either (x) the Super Super Senior Liabilities have not been
repaid in full within twelve months of the end of the Consultation Period, (y) the Security Agent has not
commenced any Enforcement (or any transaction in lieu) or other Enforcement Action within nine months
of the end of the Consultation Period or (z) at any time (whether before or after the end of the Consultation
Period) an insolvency event has occurred with respect to a Relevant Company and the Security Agent has
not commenced any Enforcement (or any transaction in lieu) or other Enforcement Action at that time
with respect to such Relevant Company, then, in relation to instructions with respect to any Enforcement,
the Security Agent shall thereafter follow any instructions that are subsequently given by the Majority
Super Super Senior Creditors (in each case provided the same are Qualifying Instructions) to the exclusion
of those given by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors and the Majority Super Senior Creditors (to the
extent conflicting with any instructions previously given by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors and
the Majority Super Senior Creditors).

###### Security Enforcement Principles

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that enforcement of the Transaction Security must be conducted in
accordance with the “Security Enforcement Principles,” which principles shall include the following:

(a) It shall be the primary and over-riding aim of any Enforcement of the Transaction Security to maximize,
so far as is consistent with a prompt and expeditious realization of value from Enforcement of the
Transaction Security, and in a manner consistent with the Intercreditor Agreement, the recovery of the
Pension Guarantee Lenders and Additional Pension Guarantee Facility Lenders, the RCF and Guarantee
Lenders and Additional Credit Facility Lenders, the Hedging Banks, the holders of the Senior Secured
Notes and their representatives, the Future Pari Passu Debt Creditors and their representatives and the
Future Senior Subordinated Creditors (to the extent the Transaction Security is expressed to secure such
debt) and their representatives (the “Security Enforcement Objective”).

(b) Without prejudice to the Security Enforcement Objective, the Transaction Security is enforced and any
other action as to Enforcement is taken such that either:

(i) all proceeds of Enforcement are received by the Security Agent in money (or substantially all cash)
for distribution in accordance with the Payments Waterfall; or

(ii) sufficient proceeds of Enforcement is received by the Security Agent in money to ensure that when
the proceeds are applied in accordance with the Payments Waterfall, first, the Super Super Senior
Liabilities are repaid and discharged in full (unless the Majority Super Super Senior Creditors
agree otherwise) and second, the Super Senior Liabilities are repaid and discharged in full (unless
the Majority Super Senior Creditors agree otherwise).

(c) On:

(i) a proposed Enforcement of any of the Transaction Security over assets other than shares in a
member of the Group, where the aggregate book value of such assets exceeds €5.0 million (or its
equivalent); or

(ii) a proposed Enforcement of any of the Transaction Security over some or all of the shares in a

Where a Distressed Disposal of an asset is being effected, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the
Security Agent is authorized:

(a) to release the Transaction Security, or any other claim over the relevant asset;

(b) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of an Obligor, to release: (i) that Obligor

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected such that the claims of the holders of the Future Senior Subordinated
Debt Liabilities and Transaction Security over shares in (and any shareholder loans to) the Issuer or assets of a
guarantor of Future Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities or the Issuer is released, it will be a further condition
to the release that either:

(i) the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Representative has approved the release on the instructions of the
requisite Future Senior Subordinated Debt Creditors (as determined under the relevant Future Senior
Subordinated Debt Documents or, if not addressed thereunder, with the approval of at least a majority of
such Future Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities); or

(ii) each of the following conditions are satisfied:

(A) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash);

Security Agent (as the case may be) for application in accordance with the provisions set forth under “—
_Application of Proceeds/Waterfall” above as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of the_

###### DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES

_You will find definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this “Description of the Notes” under the heading_
_“Certain Definitions”. For purposes of this “Description of the Notes,” references to “we,” “our,” and “us”_
_refer to the Issuer and its subsidiaries and references to the “Issuer” refer to Apollo Swedish Bidco AB._

The Issuer will issue €480 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2029
(the “Notes”) under an indenture to be dated as of, 2023 (the “Indenture”), between, inter alios, the
Issuer, Deutsche Trustee Company Limited, as trustee (the “Trustee”), and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch,
as security agent (the “Security Agent”) and as paying agent. The Indenture will not be qualified under,
incorporate or include, by reference or otherwise, or be subject to, any of the provisions of the U.S. Trust
Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

The proceeds of the offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date will be used as set forth in this Offering
Memorandum under the caption “Use of Proceeds.”

The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which €480 million aggregate principal amount
of Notes will be issued in this Offering. We may, subject to applicable law, issue an unlimited principal amount
of additional Notes having identical terms and conditions as the Notes (the “Additional Notes”); provided that,
if the Additional Notes are not fungible with the initial Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such
Additional Notes will be issued with a separate ISIN code or common code, as applicable, from the Notes. We
will only be permitted to issue Additional Notes in compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture,
including the covenant restricting the Incurrence of Indebtedness (as described below under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”). Except with respect to right of payment and optional redemption, and_
as otherwise provided for in the Indenture, the Notes issued in this Offering and, if issued, any Additional Notes
will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect
to waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Unless the context otherwise requires, in this
“Description of the Notes,” references to the “Notes” include the Notes and any Additional Notes that are actually
issued.

The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements (each as defined below). The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding
the terms and ranking of the Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” for a description of the material terms of the Intercreditor Agreement._

This “Description of the Notes” is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Notes, the
Indenture and the Security Documents, and it refers to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Since
this description of the terms of the Notes is only a summary, you should refer to the Notes, the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents for complete descriptions of the obligations of the Issuer
and your rights. Copies of the Indenture are available from us upon request.

The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered Holders will
have rights under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to enforcement and the pursuit of
other remedies. The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act and are subject to
certain transfer restrictions.

###### Principal and Maturity

The Issuer will issue €480 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes on the Issue Date (the “Initial Notes”).
The Notes will mature on, 2029. The Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000
and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

###### Interest

Interest on the Notes will accrue at a rate per annum (the “Applicable Rate”), reset quarterly, equal to the sum
of (i) three-month EURIBOR (and if that rate is less than zero, EURIBOR shall be deemed to be zero) plus
(ii) %, as determined by the calculation agent (the “Calculation Agent”), who shall initially be
Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch. Interest on the Notes will:

180


-----

- accrue from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid;

- be payable quarterly in arrear on,, and, commencing
on, 2023;

- be payable to the Holder of record of such Notes on the business day immediately preceding the related
interest payment date; and

- be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed.

Set forth below is a summary of certain of the provisions from the Indenture relating to the calculation of interest
on the Notes.

“Determination Date” means, with respect to an Interest Period, the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days
preceding the first day of such Interest Period.

“EURIBOR” means, with respect to an Interest Period, the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for
deposits in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the
Determination Date that appears on Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page or Bloomberg equivalent as of 11:00
a.m. London time, on the Determination Date. If Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page or its Bloomberg equivalent
does not include such a rate or is unavailable on a Determination Date, the Issuer will request the principal
London office of each of four major banks in the euro-zone inter-bank market, as selected by the Issuer, to provide
such bank’s offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London
time, on such Determination Date, to prime banks in the euro-zone inter-bank market for deposits in a
Representative Amount in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement
Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, the rate for the Interest
Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the
Issuer will request that each of three major banks in London, as selected by the Issuer, to provide such bank’s
rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Determination
Date, for loans in a Representative Amount in euro to leading European banks for a three-month period beginning
on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such rates are so
provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than such rates are so
provided, then the rate for the Interest Period will be the rate in effect with respect to the immediately preceding
Interest Period.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if for any Interest Period the rate determined based on the procedure specified in
this paragraph is less than 0.0%, EURIBOR shall mean 0.0% for purposes of determining the Applicable Rate
for such Interest Period.

In the event that EURIBOR is no longer being calculated or administered or is otherwise no longer generally
accepted in the euro-zone for the purposes of determining floating rates of interest in respect of euro-denominated
securities, the alternative basis for determining the rate of interest on the Notes will be any successor rate
generally accepted in the euro-zone for the purposes of determining floating rates of interest in respect of eurodenominated securities, as identified by the Issuer in good faith; _provided that, in the event that there is no_
generally accepted successor rate to EURIBOR in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, the Issuer, in consultation
with the Rate Determination Agent, shall determine a reasonably appropriate alternative basis for determining
the rate of interest (and any applicable adjustment spread to reduce or eliminate, to the extent reasonably
practicable in the circumstances, any economic prejudice or benefit (as the case may be) to Holders of the Notes
as a result of the replacement of EURIBOR (the “Adjustment Spread”)) on the Notes; provided, further, that
any such alternative basis adopted pursuant to this paragraph shall in all cases never be less than 0.0%. Following
the adoption of an alternative basis pursuant to this paragraph, all references to “EURIBOR” in the Indenture
shall be deemed to refer to such alternative basis. The Issuer shall promptly thereafter notify the Holders of the
Notes and (by way of an Officer’s Certificate, delivered at least two Business Days prior to the relevant
Determination Date) the Calculation Agent of the new rate replacing EURIBOR, and the Calculation Agent shall
be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate (without further enquiry, investigation, verification or liability of

181


-----

any kind whatsoever) as sufficient evidence thereof. Holders of the Notes shall be bound by any such alternative
basis (and the Adjustment Spread) without any further action or consent by the Holders of the Notes or the
Trustee; provided that if the Calculation Agent is unable (based on the information provided by the Issuer with
respect to such new rate or Adjustment Spread (if any)) to calculate, or calculate definitely, the interest rate
applicable to the Interest Period commencing immediately following notification thereof, then EURIBOR in
respect of such Interest Period will be the EURIBOR in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest
Period.

None of the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent shall be responsible or liable for any action or
inaction of the Issuer or its determination of such new rate. Nothing in the Indenture will require or oblige the
Trustee, Paying Agent or Calculation Agent to agree to any amendment or modification in connection with such
new rate which may, in its opinion, expose the Trustee, Paying Agent or Calculation Agent to any additional
liabilities or increase in its obligations or decrease in its rights or protections.

“euro-zone” means the region comprising of the member states of the European Union that adopt the euro.

“Interest Period” means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and ending on and
including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest payment date, with the exception that the
first Interest Period shall commence on and include the Issue Date and end on and include, 2023.

“Representative Amount” means the greater of (i) €1,000,000 and (ii) an amount that is representative for a
single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time.

“Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page” means the display page so designated by Reuters (or such other page as
may replace that page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the information vendor).

“TARGET Settlement Day” means any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross
Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET) System is open.

The Calculation Agent shall, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (London time) on each Determination Date,
determine the Applicable Rate and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable in respect of the following
Interest Period (the “Interest Amount”). The Interest Amount shall be calculated by applying the Applicable
Rate to the principal amount of each Note outstanding at the commencement of the Interest Period, multiplying
each such amount by the actual amounts of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 360. All percentages
resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth
of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g. 4.876545% (or
.04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or .0487655)). All euro amounts used in or resulting from such
calculations will be rounded to the nearest euro cent (with one half euro cent being rounded upwards). The
determination of the Applicable Rate and the Interest Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of
willful default, fraud or manifest error, be final and binding on all parties. In no event will the rate of interest on
the Notes be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, provided, however, that the Calculation
Agent shall not be responsible for verifying that the rate of interest on the Notes is permitted under any applicable
law.

The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on such Notes are subject to applicable procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day at the
place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount
due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other
payment as a result of any such delay.

###### Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes

Principal, interest and premium, if any, on the Global Notes (as defined below) will be payable at the specified
office or agency of one or more Paying Agents; _provided_ that all such payments with respect to the Notes
represented by one or more Global Note registered in the name of or held by a nominee of a common depositary
for Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account specified by the Holder or Holders thereof.

182


-----

Principal, interest, premium and Additional Amounts if any, on any certificated securities (“Definitive
**Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents maintained**
for such purposes. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be paid by wire transfer to the
person entitled thereto as shown on the register for the Definitive Registered Notes. See “—Paying Agent and
_Registrar for the Notes.”_

###### Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes

The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Notes. The Initial Paying Agent will be Deutsche
Bank AG, London Branch (the “Paying Agent”).

The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”) and a transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”). The
initial Registrar shall be Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. and the initial Transfer Agent shall be Deutsche Bank
AG, London Branch. The Registrar and Transfer Agent will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Notes
outstanding from time to time, if any, and will make payments on and facilitate transfers of the Notes on behalf
of the Issuer.

The Issuer may change any Paying Agents, Registrars or Transfer Agents for the Notes without prior notice to
the Holders of such Notes. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect
of the Notes.

###### Guarantees

On the Issue Date, the Notes will not be guaranteed. However, within 90 days following the Issue Date, the
obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Notes, including any payment obligation resulting from a Change of
Control, will (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) be guaranteed, jointly and severally on a senior basis,
by each Subsidiary of the Issuer that is a guarantor under the Pension Guarantee Facility and the Super Senior
Facilities, including Assemblin Group AB, Assemblin Holding AB, Assemblin AB, Assemblin Sweden AB,
Assemblin Norge AS, Senera Oy, Fidelix Holding Oy, Assemblin AS, Assemblin VS AB, Assemblin El AB,
Assemblin Ventilation AB, EcoGuard AB, Tom Allen Senera Oy, Fidelix Oy, Bankeryds Rör AB, Säkra
Fastigheter i Sverige AB and Hallingdal Varme og Sanitær AS (the “Initial Guarantors”). As of and for the
twelve months ended March 31, 2023, the Initial Guarantors represented 79.8 per cent. of our net revenues, 79.5
per cent. of our EBITDA and over 100 per cent. of our assets (other than goodwill and shares in subsidiaries), in
each case, calculated on a stand-alone basis without giving effect to intra-group eliminations.

The obligations of the Guarantors will be contractually limited under the applicable Guarantees to reflect
limitations under applicable law with respect to maintenance of share capital, corporate benefit, fraudulent
conveyance and other legal restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and their respective shareholders, directors
and general partners. For a description of such legal and contractual limitations, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related
_to the Notes and the Collateral—The Notes Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to_
_certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may_
_limit their validity and enforceability,” and “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity_
_and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

A significant portion of the operations of the Issuer will be conducted through its Restricted Subsidiaries. Claims
of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors
holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority
stockholders (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and
earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including
Holders of the Notes. The Notes and each Guarantee therefore will be effectively subordinated to creditors
(including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of Restricted Subsidiaries of the
Issuer (other than the Guarantors). See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Collateral——The
_Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-Guarantor members of our Group.” Although the_
Indenture limits the incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted
Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture does not
impose any limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered

183


-----

Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation
_on Indebtedness.”_

In addition, as described below under “—Certain Covenants—Future Guarantees” and subject to the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, each Restricted Subsidiary that guarantees the
Pension Guarantee Facility, the Super Senior Facilities, Public Debt or certain other indebtedness shall also enter
into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Notes.

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the
Pension Guarantee Facility, the Super Senior Facilities and the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include
restrictions on the granting of guarantees including where, among other things, such the relevant entity is not
incorporated other than in an agreed guarantee jurisdiction or is where such grant would be restricted by general
statutory or other contractual or legal limitations, restrictions or requirements, financial assistance, corporate
benefit, fraudulent preference, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and similar principles.

Each Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject
to avoidance or illegality under applicable financial assistance rules or fraudulent conveyance provisions of the
United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required
under the Agreed Security Principles to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By
virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts
payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Collateral—The Notes Guarantees and the Collateral securing
_the Notes will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject_
_to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability,” and “Certain Insolvency Considerations and_
_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

The Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and release as described under “Certain Covenants—Release of the
_Guarantees.”_

###### Transfer and Exchange

The Notes will be issued in the form of several registered notes in global form without interest coupons, as
follows:

- Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the
Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest
coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”). The 144A Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be
deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of
Euroclear and Clearstream.

- Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be
represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
“Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The
Regulation S Global Note will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the
nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have
accounts with Euroclear and Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants.

Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on
transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under the section “Offering
_and Transfer Restrictions” in the Offering Memorandum. In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between_
participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant
to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or
Clearstream and their respective participants.

184


-----

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) may be transferred to a
person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation
**S Book-Entry Interests”) denominated in the same currency only upon delivery by the transferor of a written**
certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance
with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Prior to 40 days after the Issue Date of the Notes, ownership of Regulation S Book-Entry Interests will be limited
to persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or persons who hold interests through Euroclear or
Clearstream, and any sale or transfer of such interest to US persons shall not be permitted during such period
unless such resale or transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Subject to the foregoing,
Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of 144A BookEntry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a
“qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of
Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under the section “Offering and
_Transfer Restrictions” in the Offering Memorandum and in accordance with any applicable securities law of any_
other jurisdiction.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a
Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it
will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000
principal amount, and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions
relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected
that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from
the participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange
for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in
compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer
summarized below and described more fully under the section “Offering and Transfer Restrictions” in the
Offering Memorandum.

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be
transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 in principal amount and
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture
will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and
transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream,
where appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with such
transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any
Taxes payable in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Definitive
Registered Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control
Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will be entitled to treat the Holder
of a Note as the owner of it for all purposes.

185


-----

###### Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries

As of the Issue Date, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for purposes of the
Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under “—Certain Definitions—Unrestricted
_Subsidiary,” the Issuer will be permitted to designate certain of its Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries”._
Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture.

###### Security

 General

On the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, certain perfection
requirements and any Permitted Collateral Liens, by security interests granted on an equal and ratable first
priority basis over:

- the issued Capital Stock of the Issuer (the “Issuer Share Pledge”);

- the issued Capital Stock of Assemblin Group AB;

- certain long-term material intra-Group loans (in respect of which the Issuer is a creditor), with a final
maturity date or intended tenor in excess of 12 months and with a principal amount in excess of €20
million (or its equivalent in other currencies) in aggregate to a Restricted Subsidiary as debtor (if any);

- existing and future shareholder loans owed by the Issuer to its immediate Parent; and

- the Issuer’s material operating bank accounts (but excluding any escrow, cash collateral, blocked and
pooling accounts, accounts connected with any Bank Products, accounts in connection with any
receivables financing (including discounting or factoring or similar), any guarantee or letter of credit
financing, or similar) (if any),

(together, the “Issue Date Collateral”).

Within 90 days of the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, certain
perfection requirements and any Permitted Collateral Liens, by Security Interests granted on an equal and ratable
first priority basis over the following property, rights and assets:

- the issued Capital Stock of the remaining Initial Guarantors;

- certain of the Initial Guarantors’ material operating bank accounts (but excluding any escrow, cash
collateral, blocked and pooling accounts, accounts connected with any Bank Products, accounts in
connection with any receivables financing (including discounting or factoring or similar), any guarantee
or letter of credit financing, or similar) (if any, and only to the extent that such bank accounts are required
to be secured under the Super Senior Facilities Agreements);

- certain long-term material intra-Group loans (in respect of which an Initial Guarantor is a creditor), with
a final maturity date in excess of 12 months and with a principal amount in excess of €20 million (or its
equivalent in other currencies) in aggregate to another Initial Guarantor as debtor (if any); and

- certain of the Initial Guarantors’ business mortgages (but only to the extent in existence prior to the date
of the super senior revolving credit and guarantee facilities agreement and pension guarantee agreement
and agreed between the Issuer and the mandated lead arrangers prior to the date of such agreements),

(together with the Issue Date Collateral, the “Collateral”).

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the Issuer and its Restricted_
Subsidiaries are permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with future issuances of
Indebtedness or Indebtedness of the Restricted Subsidiaries, including any Additional Notes issued by the Issuer
as permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes
_and the Collateral.”_

186


-----

Any other security interests that may in the future be granted to secure obligations under the Notes, any Guarantee
and the Indenture would also constitute “Collateral.” All Collateral will be subject to the operation of the Agreed
Security Principles and any Permitted Collateral Liens.

Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of the covenant described below under “—Certain
_Covenants—Future Guarantees,” certain property, rights and assets may not be pledged, and any pledge over_
property, rights and assets may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed Security
Principles. Pursuant to the Agreed Security Principles, a guarantee or security may not be given, or may be
limited. The following is a non-exhaustive summary of certain terms of the Agreed Security Principles which
include, among others:

- general legal and statutory limitations, financial assistance, capital maintenance, corporate benefit,
fraudulent preference, “interest stripping,” “controlled foreign corporation,” thin capitalization rules,
retention of title claims, employee consultation or approval requirements and similar principles may limit
the ability of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”) to provide a Guarantee
or security or may require that the Guarantee or security be limited by an amount or otherwise. If any
such limit applies, the Guarantees and security provided will be limited to the maximum amount which
the relevant member of the Group may provide having regard to applicable law (including any
jurisprudence) and subject to fiduciary duties of management;

- the giving of a Guarantee, the granting and the terms of security, the registration and/or the perfection of
the security granted or the becoming of a Guarantor will not be required;

- to the extent that the Group would incur any legal fees, registration fees, notary fees, stamp duty, taxes
and any other fees or costs directly associated with such security or Guarantee which are disproportionate
to the benefit obtained by the secured parties or having regard to the extent of the obligations which can
be guaranteed or secured by that security and the priority that will be offered by taking or perfecting the
security and, in any case, the security and the extent of its perfection will be agreed on the basis that the
cost to the Group of providing security shall be proportionate to the benefit accruing to the secured parties;

- where there is material incremental cost involved in creating security over all assets owned by the Issuer
or any Guarantor in a particular category the principle stated in the previous bullet above shall apply and,
subject to the Agreed Security Principles, only the material assets in that category shall be subject to
security;

- in certain jurisdictions, it may be either impossible, impractical or disproportionately costly to grant
Guarantees or create security over certain categories of assets in which event such Guarantees will not be
granted and security will not be taken over such assets;

- certain supervisory board, works council, regulator or regulatory board (or equivalent), or another external
body’s or person’s consent may be required to enable a member of the Group to provide a guarantee or
security. Such guarantee and/or security shall not be required unless such consent has been received
provided that reasonable endeavors have been used by the relevant member of the Group to obtain the
relevant consent (in each case if the security agent, taking into account the Issuer’s view on any potential
impact on relationships with third parties, reasonably requests the Issuer to do so);

- in connection with an acquisition or in respect of any acquired person or entity, any deadline and/or timing
requirement in connection with the giving of a guarantee, the granting of security, the registration and/or
the perfection of security, or the becoming of an Issuer, Guarantor or any other party may be amended,
varied, delayed and/or postponed by the Issuer (acting reasonably) in order to carry out or facilitate any
de-listing, public offers, squeeze-outs, compulsory redemption proceedings, irrevocables, private or open
market purchases, merger transactions and/or any other public or private sale, contribution, right of
transfer, or other similar transactions or arrangements (or any combination thereof);

- any person or assets subject to legal requirements, leases, licenses or any other third-party arrangements
(including, without limitation, any trade receivables and any commercial contract agreement) which may

187


-----

prevent a guarantee being granted or those assets from being charged (or guarantee which, if granted, or
assets which, if charged, would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights,
benefits and/or obligations of the Group in respect of those assets or require any member of the Group to
take any action materially adverse to the interests of the Group or any member thereof) will be excluded
from any requirement to provide guarantees and security and from any relevant Security Document
provided that, if the relevant asset is material and the Issuer determines (acting in good faith) that such
endeavors will not jeopardize commercial relationships with third parties, the relevant member of the
Group will use commercially reasonable endeavors to obtain any necessary consent or waiver;

- notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision to the contrary, no guarantees or security shall be
required from or over (and no consent or waiver request submitted with respect to) any person or assets
which are required to support letter of credit/bank guarantee arrangements (or similar), leasing
arrangements of indebtedness assumed or incurred in connection with an acquisition to the extent
permitted by the terms of the Notes Documents to remain outstanding following an acquisition
(“Assumed Acquisition Indebtedness”) and no member of the target group or other person or entity
acquired pursuant to an acquisition where Assumed Acquisition Indebtedness remains outstanding
following completion of such permitted acquisition shall be required to become a Guarantor or grant
security with respect to the Notes Documents if prevented or restricted by the terms of Assumed
Acquisition Indebtedness (or the documentation governing Assumed Acquisition Indebtedness) (or any
permitted refinancing or replacement of such Assumed Acquisition Indebtedness) or if becoming a
Guarantor or the granting of any security would give rise to a material obligation (including any material
expense or payment obligation) under or in relation thereto, and no security will be required to be granted
over any asset to the extent constituting a Permitted Lien (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, under
paragraph (28) of that definition);

- members of the Group will not be required to give Guarantees or enter into Security Documents if it is
not within the legal capacity of the relevant members of the Group or if the same would conflict with the
fiduciary duties of those directors or contravene any legal prohibition, bona fide contractual restriction or
regulatory condition or result in (or in a material risk of) personal or criminal liability on the part of any
Officer or result in any significant risk of legal liability for the directors of any Group company, provided
that the relevant member of the Group shall use reasonable endeavors to overcome such obstacle;

- additional guarantee limitation provisions may be included in any supplemental indenture if required by
any Officer of any member of the Group in connection with the granting of a Guarantee in order to protect
that Officer from potential liability or other legal risk;

- the terms of the security should not be such that they materially restrict the running of the business of or
materially adversely affect the tax arrangements of the relevant member of the Group in the ordinary
course as otherwise permitted by the Notes Documents;

- perfection of security, when required, and other legal formalities will be completed as soon as practicable
and, in any event, within the time periods specified in the Notes Documents therefor or (if earlier or to
the extent no such time periods are specified in the Notes Documents) within the time periods specified
by applicable law in order to ensure due perfection. The giving of guarantee, the granting of security or
the perfection of security interests granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse effect
on the ability of the relevant Guarantor to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course as
otherwise permitted by the Notes Documents (and any requirement under the Agreed Security Principles
to seek consent of any person or take or not take any other action shall be subject to this paragraph);

- access to the assets of a Guarantor and the maximum guaranteed or secured amount may be restricted or
limited to minimize stamp duty, notarization, registration or other applicable fees, taxes and duties where
the benefit of increasing the guaranteed or secured amount is disproportionate to the level of such fees,
taxes and duties (and in any event the maximum aggregate amount payable by the Group in respect of

188


-----

fees, costs, expenses, disbursements and VAT relating to the provision of guarantees and security shall be
limited to an amount to be agreed between the security agent and the Issuer);

- no perfection action will be required in jurisdictions where the Issuer or a Guarantor is not located;
provided, however, that perfection actions may be required in the jurisdiction of one Guarantor in relation
to security granted by another Guarantor in a different jurisdiction; provided further than no perfection
action shall be required in relation to any security other than security granted over (i) the Capital Stock in
an Issuer or Guarantor incorporated in an agreed security jurisdiction (being, as at the Issue Date, Sweden,
Finland, Denmark and Norway); (ii) Subordinated Shareholder Funding provided to the Issuer pursuant
to a Security Document governed by Swedish law; (iii) business mortgages by certain Initial Guarantors
pursuant to a Security Document governed by Swedish law; and (iv) (solely upon the occurrence of an
enforcement event) (x) certain structural intercompany loans by an Issuer or Guarantor; or (y) material
operating bank accounts;

- guarantees and security will not be required from or over, or over the assets of, any joint venture or similar
arrangement or any minority interest;

- where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of granting
security over the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such security, security will be
granted over the material assets only;

- any member of the Group which is not incorporated in an agreed security jurisdiction (being, as at the
Issue Date, Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Norway) shall not be required to become a Guarantor or
provide security, and no guarantees or security shall be required in respect of assets located outside of the
agreed security jurisdictions;

- any member of the Group which is not (directly or indirectly) a wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Issuer (a
“Non Wholly-Owned Subsidiary”) shall not be required to become a Guarantor or provide any security,
if the Issuer is unable (after using its commercially reasonable endeavors, and provided that doing so does
not give rise to additional material obligations (including any expense or payment obligation) under or in
relation thereto) to procure consent from the minority shareholders to such member of the Group
becoming a Guarantor (including (without limitation) due to, for example, the opposition of the minority
shareholders, material payment obligations, legal or regulatory constraints or financial assistance
restrictions) and provided that this paragraph shall not apply to any Non Wholly-Owned Subsidiary which
is an Issuer;

- no security (other than floating security) will be required to be taken over fixed assets, parts, stock,
moveable plant or equipment, trade receivables, intellectual property rights or real estate (other than where
such security may be granted under local law pursuant to a “floating charge” or all assets Security
Document without material cost to the relevant Guarantor), and no security will be required over hedging
agreements;

- no security shall be required to be given over any escrow, cash collateral, blocked and pooling accounts,
accounts connected with any Bank Products, any receivables financing (including Qualified Receivables
Financing, discounting or factoring or similar), any guarantee or letter of credit financing, or similar), or
any accounts which are not material operating bank accounts;

- no Guarantee or security shall Guarantee or secure any “Excluded Swap Obligations” defined in
accordance with the LSTA Market Advisory Update dated February 15, 2013 entitled “Swap Regulations’
Implications for Loan Documentation,” and any update thereto by the LSTA;

- no member of the Group will be required to create security over or otherwise encumber any Restricted
Asset (as defined below) (including, without limitation, any bank accounts which contain or are
reasonably likely to contain any Restricted Assets); and

189


-----

- no guarantees or security shall be required to be provided where to do so would be contrary to applicable
law or the provisions of the Agreed Security Principles. By virtue of the operation of the Agreed Security
Principles, guarantees and security may be given to, for the benefit of, or in respect of, certain secured
parties and certain liabilities which may not be given to, for the benefit of, or in respect of, other secured
parties and other liabilities (which may include the Notes).

For the purposes of the foregoing paragraph, “Restricted Asset” means:

- the regulatory capital that a regulated entity is required to maintain pursuant to any applicable law or
regulation or the views, guidance or interpretation of any relevant regulator;

- the settlement cash balances of that regulated entity and any other cash held by or on behalf of that
regulated entity for merchants, card schemes, cardholders of any card scheme, banks, financial institutions
or other similar entity or person;

- any amounts held by or on behalf of that regulated entity in segregated funds under the Payment Services
Directive (PSD, 2007/64/EC) (or any relevant local implementing regulation or legislation) for merchants
or other payment service users or payment service providers or card schemes, cardholders of any card
scheme, banks, financial institutions or other similar entity or person;

- any sums receivable by or on behalf of that regulated entity from or under any card scheme, bank, financial
institution or other similar entity or person for onward transmission or remittance to a merchant;

- any sums receivable by or on behalf of that regulated entity from a merchant for onward transmission or
remittance to a card scheme bank, financial institution or other similar entity or person; and

- any right, title or interest of that regulated entity in or under any letter of credit, guarantee, cash collateral
or other financial support or security provided by a bank, financial institution or other similar entity (or
an affiliate thereof) for its account to any card scheme counterparty.

As described above, all of the Collateral will also secure the liabilities under the Super Senior Facilities, as well
as certain future Hedging Obligations and any Additional Notes and may also secure certain future indebtedness;
_provided, however, that the lenders under the Super Senior Facilities and counterparties to certain future Hedging_
Obligations, will receive the proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Holders of the
Notes and any Additional Notes. See “—Priority.” See also, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the
_Collateral—Creditors under the Super Senior Facilities, any credit facility that refinances or replaces the Super_
_Senior Facilities, certain hedging obligations and certain other indebtedness and obligations (including any_
_future guarantee facilities) permitted to be incurred on a priority basis under the Indenture are entitled to be_
_repaid in priority to the Notes.”_

The lenders under the Super Senior Facilities and/or counterparties to certain future Hedging Obligations and
any Additional Notes may also benefit from security which does not secure the Notes offered hereby.

No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with this Offering of the Notes. By its nature, some
or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the
Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
_Notes and the Collateral—It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes.”_

###### Priority

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the Security
Documents (the “Security Interests” and each a “Security Interest”) as between (a) the lenders under the
Pension Guarantee Facility, (b) the lenders under the other Super Senior Facilities, (c) the counterparties under
certain future Hedging Obligations (if any) and (d) the Trustee, the Security Agent and the Holders of the Notes
under the Indenture, respectively, is established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture, the
Security Documents and the security documents relating to the Pension Guarantee Facility, the other Super Senior
Facilities and such Hedging Obligations (if any) which provide, among other things, that the obligations under

190


-----

the Notes will receive proceeds on enforcement of security over the Collateral only after the claims of the Pension
Guarantee Facility, followed by the claims of the other Super Senior Facilities and such future Hedging
Obligations and any future Indebtedness permitted to be secured on a super-priority basis in accordance with the
terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, are satisfied.

See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”. In addition, pursuant to the
Intercreditor Agreements or Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Issue Date, the Collateral
may be pledged or assigned to secure other Indebtedness. See “—Release of Liens,” “—Certain Covenants—
_Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens.”_

###### Security Documents

Under the Security Documents, security will be granted over the Collateral to secure, inter alia, the payment
when due of the Issuer’s payment obligations under the Notes and the Indenture. The Security Documents will
be entered into among, inter alios, the relevant security provider and the Security Agent as agent for the secured
parties. When entering into the Security Documents, the Security Agent will act in its own name, but for the
benefit of the secured parties (including itself, the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes from time to time). Under
the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will also act as an agent of the lenders under the Super Senior
Facilities and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations in relation to the Security Interests created
in favor of such parties.

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by the applicable laws,
only the Security Agent will have the right to enforce the Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee and the
Holders of the Notes. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, Holders of the Notes will not be entitled
to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Security Agent
under the Indenture. To the extent permitted by the applicable laws and subject to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Indenture, Holders of the Notes will, in certain circumstances, be entitled to direct the Trustee
to provide instructions to the Security Agent for the enforcement of security over the Collateral. Under the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will also act on behalf of the lenders under the Super Senior Facilities
and the counterparties under certain hedging agreements in relation to the Security Interests in favor of such
parties.

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes and
the Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by Security Interests in the Collateral until all obligations under the
Notes and the Indenture have been discharged. However, the Security Interests may be released under certain
circumstances as provided under “—Release of Liens” below. Please see the section of this Offering
Memorandum entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Collateral.” The validity and
enforceability of the Security Interests will be subject to, inter alia, the limitations described in “Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to the Notes and the Collateral” and “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the_
_Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

The Security Documents will provide that the rights under the Security Documents and the Indenture must be
exercised by the Security Agent. The Holders may only act through the Trustee, who will instruct the Security
Agent in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.

In the event that the Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the
Security Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in the
Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the Security
Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement was successful, the Holders may not be able to recover any
amounts under the Security Documents. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Collateral.”

###### Enforcement of Security Interest

The Security Documents will provide that the rights under the Security Documents must be exercised by the
Security Agent. Since the Holders are not a party to the Security Documents, Holders may not, individually or

191


-----

collectively, take any direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Security Documents. The Holders
may only act through the Security Agent or the Trustee (as applicable).

To the extent permitted by the applicable laws and subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the
Indenture, Holders of the Notes will, in certain circumstances, be entitled to direct the Trustee to provide
instructions to the Security Agent for the enforcement of security over the Collateral. The Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement will restrict the ability of the Holders or the Trustee to enforce the Security Interests and
provide for the release of the Security Interests created by the Security Documents in certain circumstances upon
enforcement by the lenders under the Super Senior Facilities. These limitations are described under “Description
_of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Certain Insolvency Considerations and_
_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests.” The ability to_
enforce may also be restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness that is secured on the
Collateral in compliance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The creditors under the Super Senior Facilities, the counterparties to certain Hedging Obligations (if any) secured

The Issuer and its Subsidiaries and any provider of Collateral will be entitled to the release of the Security
Interests in respect of the Collateral under any one or more of the following circumstances:

defined below)) to (a) any Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any
transaction subject to “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”), if such sale or other
disposition does not violate the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of
_Assets and Subsidiary Stock” or is otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture or (b) any_
Restricted Subsidiary, provided that this clause (b) shall not be relied upon in the case of a transfer of

Notes will be secured by first-priority security interests over the issued Capital Stock of MergerCo (the
“MergerCo Share Pledge”);

(5) automatically without any action by the Trustee, if the Lien granted in favor of the Indebtedness that gave
rise to the obligation to grant the Lien over such Collateral is released and such Lien is not otherwise
required to be granted in favor of the Notes as provided under “— Certain Covenants—Limitations on
_Liens”;_

(6) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or defeasance or discharge
of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

case of a merger, consolidation or other transfer of assets in compliance with the covenant described
below under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”;

(10) with respect to the Securities Interests in respect of the Capital Stock of a Person or its Restricted
Subsidiary or Parent to be Offered, within a reasonable time to facilitate an Initial Public Offering in
which such Person or its Restricted Subsidiary or Parent is the IPO Entity (an “IPO Release”); provided
that (i) the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio is not, at such time, greater than 3.75 to 1.00 (calculated on
a pro forma basis after giving effect to such Initial Public Offering and the receipt and use of proceeds
therefrom) and (ii) such security interests so released shall be promptly granted or re-granted, as
applicable, in favor of the Notes in the event that such Capital Stock is not sold or the Initial Public
Offering does not complete for any reason; or

(11) in the case of any security interests over intra-group receivables (if any), upon partial repayment or
discharge thereof, the security interests created over such receivables will be automatically reduced in
proportion to such partial repayment or discharge and, upon full repayment or discharge thereof, the
security interests shall be automatically and fully released and of no further effect; or

(12) as may be permitted by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security
_Interest” or as otherwise provided in the Indenture._

At the request of the Issuer, the Security Agent and the Trustee (if required) will take all necessary action required
to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions
of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security

Document. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the
Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee (unless action is required by it to effect such release).

Notwithstanding any other provisions, the release of any perfected Liens over any assets created by the Parent,
the Issuer or any Guarantor pursuant to a security document governed by Swedish law or Finnish law which is
“Perfected Security” (being security over (i) the Capital Stock in an Issuer or Guarantor that is incorporated in
Sweden or Finland; (ii) Subordinated Shareholder Funding; (iii) business mortgages granted by certain Initial
Guarantors) or disposal of (including by way of merger of shares or assets which are subject to such Liens) or
transfer of any assets, property and/or interests which are the subject of such Liens shall be subject to the prior
written consent of the Security Agent, except in the case of any Post-Closing Merger (completed on or prior to
the date falling 12 months after the Issue Date and provided that, to the extent involving the Issuer, the Issuer is
the surviving entity) or where the assets to be released are disposed of for market value and the proceeds are
directly paid to the Security Agent and applied towards repayment and/or prepayment of any debt secured by the
relevant Liens (or are paid into a blocked account which is subject to perfected Liens and held with the Security
Agent). The Security Agent’s consent shall be given in its sole discretion.

Each Holder of the Notes irrevocably authorises and instructs the Security Agent to consent to any such release
and to release such Liens in relation to any transaction or arrangement which is permitted by the Indenture,
without notification, consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from or reference to the Holders. The
Security Agent shall not unreasonably delay the giving of such consent and release.

###### Optional Redemption

Except as described below and except as described under “Redemption for Taxation Reasons,” the Notes are not
redeemable until, 2024.

On and after, 2024, the Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, part of the Notes upon not less than
10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at the following redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of principal
amount) plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts (as defined below), if any, to, but not
including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning
on of the year indicated below:

**Redemption**


**Year**


**Price**


2024 and thereafter................................................................................................................... 100.00%

In addition, prior to, 2024, the Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, a part of the Notes upon not
less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice at a redemption price equal to 100.00% of the principal amount of the
Notes, plus the Applicable Premium and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not
including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

Any such redemption and notice may, in the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more
conditions precedent. If such redemption or notice is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent,
such notice shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any
or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in
the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption
date so delayed, provided that in no case shall the notice have been delivered less than 10 days or more than 60
days prior to the date on which such redemption (if any) occurs. In addition, the Issuer may provide in such
notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to such
redemption may be performed by another Person. In no event shall the Trustee be responsible for monitoring, or
charged with knowledge of, the maximum aggregate amount of the Notes eligible under the Indenture to be
redeemed.

194


-----

###### General

We may repurchase the Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or otherwise. Notice of
redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice” below.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment
date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at the close
of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject
to redemption by the Issuer.

In connection with any redemption of Notes, any such redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to
one or more conditions precedent.

###### Sinking Fund

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the
Notes.

###### Post Tender Redemption

In connection with any tender offer for the Notes, if Holders of Notes of not less than 90% in aggregate principal
amount of the applicable outstanding Notes validly tendered and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer
and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes
validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not
less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 10 days following such tender offer
expiration date, to redeem the Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase,
at a price equal to the price (excluding any early tender premium or similar payment) offered to each other Holder
of Notes in such tender offer, plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding such redemption date.

###### Redemption at Maturity

On, 2029 the Issuer will redeem the Notes that have not been previously redeemed or purchased and
cancelled at 100.00% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and Additional Amounts,
if any, to the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

###### Selection and Notice

If less than all of any series of Notes is to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or the Registrar will select
Notes for redemption in compliance with the requirements of the principal securities exchange, if any, on which
the Notes are listed, and in compliance with the requirements of Euroclear or Clearstream, or if the Notes are not
so listed or such exchange prescribes no method of selection and the Notes are not held through Euroclear or
Clearstream, or Euroclear or Clearstream prescribes no method of selection, on a pro rata basis by use of a pool
factor; provided, however, that no Note of €100,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in
part and only Notes in integral multiples of €1,000 will be redeemed. Neither the Trustee, the Paying Agent nor
the Registrar will be liable for any selections made in accordance with this paragraph.

If and so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited
and to the extent that the rules and regulations of The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the
“Authority”) so require, the Issuer shall notify the Authority of such redemption and, in addition to such
publication, not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption, the Issuer will mail, or at the
expense of the Issuer, cause to be mailed, such notice to Holders. All notices to Holders will be validly given if
mailed to them at their respective addresses in the register of Holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar. For
Notes which are represented by global certificates held on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, notices may be
given by delivery of the relevant notices to Euroclear or Clearstream in substitution for the aforesaid mailing to
Holders.

195


-----

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the portion
of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive
Registered Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of any Definitive Registered Note
redeemed in part will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Definitive
Registered Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Note to decrease the
principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the
applicable redemption notice, Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and
after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of Notes called for redemption.

###### Redemption for Taxation Reasons

The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor more
than 60 days’ prior notice to the Holders of the Notes (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price
equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed
for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date
to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts (as defined below under
“—Withholding Taxes”), if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of
the redemption or otherwise, if any, if the Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder)
of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any amendment to, or change in an official written position regarding the application, administration or
interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a
court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) (each of the foregoing
in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Notes would be, required to
pay Additional Amounts with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the
payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or another Guarantor who can make such
payment without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts) and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking
reasonable measures available to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new
Paying Agent where this would be reasonable). Such Change in Tax Law must be announced and become
effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Tax Jurisdiction became a Relevant Tax
Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date). The foregoing provisions shall apply mutatis mutandis
to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture, with respect to a change
or amendments occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under
“—Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given: (a) earlier
than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of Additional
Amounts; and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains
in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing,
the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee: (i) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption
and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been
satisfied; and (ii) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing and reasonably satisfactory to
the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) to the effect that the relevant Payor has been or will
become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and
shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion of tax counsel as sufficient evidence of the
satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in which event it will be
conclusive and binding on the Holders.

###### Withholding Taxes

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (each, a “Payor”) in respect of the Notes or
with respect to any Guarantee, as applicable, will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction

196


-----

for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any
deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) Sweden or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or therein having power to tax;

(2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or any Guarantee is made by or on
behalf of the Payor, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the
power to tax; or

(3) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated, organized, engaged in business for tax purposes,
or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental
authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1), (2) and (3) a “Relevant Taxing
**Jurisdiction”),**

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor or the
Paying Agent under or with respect to any Note or any Guarantee, including, without limitation, payments of
principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such
additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in
respect of such payments, after such withholding or deduction (including any such deduction or withholding
from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been received in respect of
such payments on any such Note or Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction; _provided,_
_however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:_

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection
between the relevant Holder or the beneficial owner of a Note (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary,
partner, member or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder or beneficial owner, if
the relevant Holder or beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company
or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being resident for tax
purposes, or being a citizen or resident, national or domiciliary of, or carrying on a business for tax
purposes, or maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership,
holding or sale of such Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under
such Note, the Indenture or a Guarantee;

(2) any Tax that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner of the
Note to comply with a written request of the Payor or any other person through whom payment can be
made addressed to the Holder, after reasonable notice by the Payor (at least 60 days before any such
withholding or deduction would be payable), to provide certification, information, documents or other
evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity or connection with the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction
of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other
reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or
administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part
of such Tax but, only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such
certification or documentation;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of the Note for
payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made
available for payment to the Holder;

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment of the principal
of, premium, if any, or interest, if any, on the Notes or with respect to any Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other
governmental charge;

197


-----

(6) any Taxes imposed in connection with a Note presented for payment by or on behalf of a Holder or
beneficial owner who would have been able to avoid such Tax by presenting the relevant Note to, or
otherwise accepting payment from, another Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union; or

(7) any combination of the items (1) through (6) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or
any person other than the beneficial owner of the Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settler with respect
to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to
Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner held such Notes directly.

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture, any amounts to be paid on the Notes by or on behalf of
the Issuer will be paid net of any deduction or withholding imposed or required pursuant to an agreement
described in Section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or otherwise
imposed pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (or any regulations thereunder or official
interpretations thereof) or an intergovernmental agreement between the United States and another jurisdiction
facilitating the implementation thereof (or any fiscal or regulatory legislation, rules or practices implementing
such an intergovernmental agreement) (any such withholding or deduction, a “FATCA Withholding”). Neither
the Issuer nor any other person will be required to pay any additional amounts in respect of FATCA Withholding.

The Payor will (i) make or cause to be made any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount
deducted or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use
all reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted
or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes or, if such tax receipts are not
reasonably available, other reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee
and copied to the Paying Agent. Such copies or other evidence shall be made available to the Holders upon
request and will be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any Note or
any Guarantee, at least 45 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the
Paying Agent, an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount
estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional
Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less
than 30 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate
as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are
necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a redemption of Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context,
Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay and indemnify the Holder or beneficial owner for any present or future stamp, issue,
registration, transfer, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest,
penalties or additions to tax) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including
any related interest, penalties or additions to tax) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution,
delivery, or registration of any Notes, any Guarantee, the Indenture, or any other document or instrument in
relation thereto (other than in each case, in connection with a transfer of the Notes after this Offering) or the
receipt of any payments with respect thereto or any such taxes or charges or levies (including any related interest,

198


-----

penalties, or additions to tax) imposed by any jurisdiction as a result of, or in connection with, the enforcement
of the Notes any Guarantee (limited, solely in the case of the receipt of any payments with respect thereto, to
taxes or similar charges or levies imposed in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction that are not excluded under clauses
(1) through (3) above or clauses (5) through (7) above or any combination thereof).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and any transfer
by a Holder or beneficial owner of its Notes, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any
successor to a Payor is incorporated, organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for
tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to the Notes is made
by or on behalf of such Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**IPO Pushdown**

(1) On, in contemplation of, or following an Initial Public Offering (an “IPO Event”), the Issuer shall be
entitled to require (by written notice to the Trustee and the Security Agent (a “Pushdown Notice”)) that
the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement)
shall automatically operate (with effect from the date specified in the relevant Pushdown Notice) on the
basis that: (i) references to the “Group” and to the Issuer and Restricted Subsidiaries (and all related
provisions) shall apply only to the IPO Pushdown Entity and its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time;
(ii) all financial ratio calculations, basket calculations and financial definitions shall exclude any Parent
of the IPO Pushdown Entity and all reporting obligations shall be assumed at the level of the IPO
Pushdown Entity; (iii) each reference in the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) to the “Issuer” shall be deemed to be a reference to the IPO Pushdown Entity
(to the extent applicable and unless the context requires otherwise); and provided, further, that nothing in
this paragraph, including the deeming construct contemplated by this sub-paragraph (iii) and any action
related thereto taken by the IPO Pushdown Entity prior to but in connection with it being deemed to be
the Issuer, shall, or shall be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any
representation, warranty, undertaking, covenant or other term in the Indenture or a Default or an Event of
Default; (iv) none of the representations, warranties, undertakings, covenants or Events of Default, as
applicable, in the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the
Security Documents shall apply to any Parent of the IPO Pushdown Entity (whether in its capacity as a
Guarantor in respect of the Notes or otherwise); (v) no event, matter or circumstance relating to any Parent
of the IPO Pushdown Entity (whether in its capacity as a Guarantor or otherwise) shall, or shall be deemed
to, directly or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking,
covenant or other term in the Indenture or a Default or an Event of Default; (vi) each Holding Company
and Parent of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released from all
obligations under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement)

the Capital Stock of the IPO Entity, any Holding Company or any Parent of the IPO Entity (as applicable)
or over Subordinated Shareholder Funding provided to such entity (as applicable) pursuant to this section
“IPO Pushdown” constitutes an IPO Release as described under paragraph (9) under “—Security—
_Release of Liens” and is subject to the further conditions described therein and to the conditions described_
in the last paragraph under “—Security—Release of Liens” unless following such release, Security
Interests under Security Documents exist or will, promptly following such Initial Public Offering, exist
over the Capital Stock in a member of the Group as selected by the Issuer that holds (directly or indirectly)
all or substantially all of the assets of the Group and any Subordinated Shareholder Funding provided by
a direct or indirect shareholder to such entity, such that a single point of enforcement in respect of the
Group will be maintained after the Initial Public Offering of the IPO Entity; (vii) unless otherwise notified
by the Issuer: (A) each Person which is party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) as a “Shareholder Creditor” (as such term is defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement) shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released from the Intercreditor Agreement (or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and all obligations and restrictions under the Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (and from the date specified by the Issuer, that Person shall

-----

cease to be party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as a
“Shareholder Creditor” (as such term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) and shall have no further
rights or obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an
Investor); and (B) there shall be no obligation or requirement for any Person to become party to the
Intercreditor Agreement as a “Shareholder Creditor” (as such term is defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement); and (viii) in the event that any Person is released from or does not become party to the
Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as a “Shareholder Creditor” (as such
term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) as a consequence of this paragraph (1), any term of the
Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) which requires
or assumes that any Person be a “Shareholder Creditor” (as such term is defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement) or that any liabilities or obligations to such Person be subject to the Intercreditor Agreement
(or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or otherwise subordinated shall cease to apply.

(2) The Trustee, the Security Agent and any other agents party thereto shall be required to enter into any
amendment to the Indenture or amendment to or replacement of the Intercreditor Agreement or the other
collateral documents required by the Issuer in writing and/or take such other action as is required by the
Issuer in order to facilitate or reflect any of the matters contemplated by paragraph (1) of this covenant
(collectively, an “IPO Pushdown”). The Trustee, the Security Agent and any other agents party thereto
are each irrevocably authorized and instructed by the Holders of the Notes (without any requirement to
obtain consent by the Holders of the Notes) to execute any such amended or replacement documents
and/or take other such action on behalf of the Holders (and shall do so on the reasonable request of and
at the cost of the Issuer).

(3) For the purpose of this covenant, the “IPO Pushdown Entity” shall be the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer notified to the Trustee and the Security Agent by the Issuer in writing as the
Person to be treated as the IPO Pushdown Entity in relation to the relevant IPO Event; provided, that the
IPO Pushdown Entity shall be the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer that will issue shares, or
whose shares are to be sold, pursuant to that IPO Event (or a Parent of the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary).

(4) If the Issuer delivers a Pushdown Notice to the Trustee and the Security Agent pursuant to paragraph (1)
of this covenant in relation to a contemplated IPO Event, it shall be entitled to revoke that Pushdown
Notice at any time prior to the occurrence of the relevant IPO Event by written notice to the Trustee and
the Security Agent. In the event that any Pushdown Notice is revoked in accordance with this paragraph
(4): (i) the provisions of clauses (i) to (viii) of the first paragraph of this covenant shall cease to apply in
relation to that Pushdown Notice; (ii) if any security has been released pursuant to paragraph (1) above in
reliance on that Pushdown Notice, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Issuer or the relevant
Restricted Subsidiary shall as soon as reasonably practicable execute a replacement Security Document
in respect of that security; and (iii) if any “Shareholder Creditor” (as such term is defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement) has been released from the Intercreditor Agreement pursuant to sub-paragraph
(a)(vii) above in reliance on that Pushdown Notice, that Person shall as soon as reasonably practicable
accede to the Intercreditor Agreement as a “Shareholder Creditor” (as such term is defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement).

For the avoidance of doubt: (A) nothing in paragraph (4) above shall prohibit or otherwise restrict the Issuer from
delivering a further Pushdown Notice in relation to any actual or contemplated IPO Event; and (B) revocation of
a Pushdown Notice shall not, and shall not be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of
any representation, warranty, undertaking or other term in the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or a
Default or an Event of Default (whether by reason of any action or step taken by any Person, or any matter or
circumstance arising or committed, while that Pushdown Notice was effective or otherwise).

###### Change of Control

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms of the covenant described under this heading “—Change of
_Control,” each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part of such Holder’s Notes_

200


-----

at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes repurchased, plus accrued and
unpaid interest to (but not including) the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however, that the Issuer shall
not be obligated to repurchase the Notes as described under this heading, “—Change of Control,” in the event
and to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of the Notes of such series as
described under “—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived.

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes as described under “— Optional
_Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60_
days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will deliver a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each
Holder of Notes, with a copy to the Trustee:

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require
the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of
the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of
purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant
interest payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”);

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date
such notice is delivered) and the record date (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) stating that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue
interest on the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Payment is not paid, and
that any Notes or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest;

(4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute
the Change of Control;

(5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must
follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and

(6) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of
Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the
extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes
so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal
amount of Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer;

(4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent the Global Notes in
order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and
purchased by the Issuer; and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Registrar for
cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer.

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly deliver to each Holder of
Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee (or an
authenticating agent) will, at the cost of the Issuer, promptly authenticate and deliver (or cause to be transferred
by book-entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal
amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any, provided that each such new Note will be in
a principal amount that is at least €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

201


-----

If and so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited
and to the extent that the rules and regulations of The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited so require,
the Issuer will notify the Authority of any Change of Control Offer.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that
permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover,
recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase such
Holder’s Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the
Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party
makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements
set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes
validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control,
conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place providing
for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. The closing date of any such Change
of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control may be changed to conform to the actual closing date
of the Change of Control, provided that such closing date is not earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from
the date the Change of Control Offer notice is mailed as described in the second paragraph of this section.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and
any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To
the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the
Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached
its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of the conflict.

If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not
withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third-party making a Change of Control
Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by
such Holders, the Issuer or such third-party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’
prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer
described above, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to
101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but
excluding the date of redemption.

The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a
number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control may require a
mandatory prepayment of certain Indebtedness. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control
under certain Indebtedness and may require a mandatory prepayment of such Indebtedness may not constitute a
Change of Control under the Indenture. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain
prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be
repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer
to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the
Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s
ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial
resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required
repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Collateral—We may not be able to obtain
_the funds required to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control and the occurrence of certain important_
_corporate events will not constitute a Change of Control.”_

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets
of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a
limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of
the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree

202


-----

of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of
the property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred
and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a
result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in
outstanding principal amount of the Notes.

###### Certain Covenants

 Limitation on Indebtedness

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness (including
Acquired Indebtedness); _provided, however, that the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary may Incur_
Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) if on the date of such Incurrence and after giving pro forma
effect thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof):

(1) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Relevant Period ending on the Applicable Reporting Date for
the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been at least 2.00 to 1.00; and

(2) to the extent that the Indebtedness is Senior Secured Indebtedness, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net
Leverage Ratio for the Relevant Period ending on the Applicable Reporting Date would have been no
greater than 4.50 to 1.00.

Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not Guarantors may only incur Indebtedness pursuant to this
first paragraph if the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Indebtedness incurred by Restricted
Subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not Guarantors pursuant to this first paragraph (calculated at the time
of such incurrence and after giving effect to the incurrence of such Indebtedness and the application of
proceeds thereof, on a pro forma basis) would not exceed an amount equal to the greater of €30 million
and 25% of Consolidated EBITDA.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness (“Permitted
**Debt”):**

(1) Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility (including in respect of letters of credit or bankers’
acceptances issued or created thereunder), and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and
Guarantees in respect of such Indebtedness in a maximum aggregate principal amount at any time
outstanding not exceeding (a) the greater of (i) SEK 1,300 million and (ii) 100% of Consolidated EBITDA
_plus (b) the amount of any Guarantee Facilities, plus in the case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness_
permitted under this clause (1) or any portion thereof, the aggregate amount of fees, accrued and unpaid
interest, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs (including redemption premia and defeasance
costs) and expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing;

(2)

(a) Guarantees by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary, so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted under the terms
of the Indenture; or

(b) without limiting the covenant described under “—Limitation on Liens,” Indebtedness arising by
reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to any Person securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted under the
terms of the Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Issuer owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a Restricted
Subsidiary owing to and held by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that:

(a) in the case of Indebtedness owing by the Issuer to any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor
(except in respect of intercompany liabilities Incurred in the ordinary course of business or in

203


-----

connection with cash pooling or cash management or tax positions of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries), such Indebtedness shall be (subject to the Agreed Security Principles and the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement) unsecured and expressly subordinated in right of payment to the
prior payment in full in cash of all obligations with respect to the Notes, in the case of the Issuer,
and the respective Guarantee, in the case of a Guarantor, in each case pursuant to and to the extent
required by the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(b) (i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in any
such Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer; and (ii) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person
other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer, shall be deemed, in each case, to
constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness not permitted by this clause (3) by the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be;

(4) (a) Indebtedness represented by the Notes (other than any Additional Notes) outstanding on the Issue
Date, the related Guarantees, and any related “parallel debt” obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement
and the Security Documents, (b) any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness Incurred under the Super
Senior Facilities and Indebtedness described in clause (3) of this paragraph) outstanding on the Issue Date,

any Restricted Subsidiary or (b) Incurred to provide all or a portion of the funds utilized to consummate
the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which any Person became a Restricted
Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, with
respect to this clause (5), that on the Applicable Test Date (x) the aggregate amount of such Indebtedness
incurred under this clause (5)(x), together with any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof, does not
exceed the greater of €12 million and 10% of Consolidated EBITDA, or (y)(i) if such Indebtedness is not
Senior Secured Indebtedness, either the Issuer would have been able to Incur €1.00 of additional
Indebtedness pursuant to clause (1) of the first paragraph of this covenant after giving pro forma effect to
the relevant acquisition and the Incurrence of such Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (5) or the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio would not be less than it was immediately prior to giving pro forma effect to such
acquisition or other transaction and the incurrence of such Indebtedness or (ii) if such Indebtedness
constitutes Senior Secured Indebtedness, either the Issuer would have been able to Incur €1.00 of
additional Indebtedness pursuant to clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant after giving pro
forma effect to the relevant acquisition and the Incurrence of such Indebtedness pursuant to this clause
(5) or the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio would not be greater than it was immediately
prior to giving pro forma effect to such acquisition or other transaction and the incurrence of such
Indebtedness or (z) in the case of Acquired Indebtedness, such Indebtedness is discharged within six
months of Incurrence or would otherwise constitute Permitted Debt or Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to
the first paragraph of this covenant;

(6) Indebtedness under Currency Agreements, Interest Rate Agreements and Commodity Hedging
Agreements not for speculative purposes (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an

assets, and any Indebtedness which refinances, replaces or refunds such Indebtedness, either (x) Incurred
in the ordinary course of business in connection with vehicle leases or (y) in an aggregate outstanding
principal amount which, when taken together with the principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred
pursuant to this clause (7) and then outstanding, will not exceed at any time outstanding the greater of
€80 million and 66% of Consolidated EBITDA;

(8) Indebtedness in respect of (a) workers’ compensation claims, self-insurance obligations, performance,

-----

For purposes of determining compliance with, and without prejudice to the section “—Financial Calculations,”
and the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with,
this covenant:

(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described
in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may
from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and
type of such Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first paragraph of this
covenant;

(2) all Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date under the Super Senior Facilities shall be deemed initially
Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant and not the first paragraph or clause
(4)(b) of the second paragraph of this covenant, and may not be reclassified;

(3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of
a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred
pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (7), (11), (15),
(16) or (18) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’
acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall
not be included;

(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock
of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or
repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation
preference thereof;

(6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision
permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or
more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(7) for the purposes of determining “Consolidated EBITDA” (x) pro forma effect shall be given to
Consolidated EBITDA on the same basis for calculating the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio for the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries and (y) in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance
Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on a clause of the first or second paragraphs of this covenant
measured by reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, if such
refinancing would cause the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated
based on the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of
Consolidated EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of
such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being
refinanced, plus premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance, costs and fees in connection with
such refinancing;

(8) in the event that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments under a
revolving credit facility or letter of credit facility, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Net
Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or Consolidated EBITDA-based
permission, as applicable, for borrowings and reborrowing thereunder (and including issuance and
creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will, at the Issuer’s option as elected on
the date the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, enters into or increases such
commitments, either (a) be determined on the date of such revolving credit facility, such letter of credit
facility or such increase in commitments (assuming that the full amount thereof has been borrowed as of
such date), and, if such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, Consolidated
Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or Consolidated EBITDA-based permission, as applicable, is satisfied
with respect thereto at such time, any borrowing or reborrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation

207


-----

of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be permitted under this covenant irrespective
of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Senior Secured Net
Leverage Ratio or Consolidated EBITDA, as applicable, at the time of any borrowing or reborrowing (or
issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the committed amount
permitted to be borrowed or reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’
acceptances) on a date pursuant to the operation of this clause (a) shall be the “Reserved Indebtedness
Amount” as of such date for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Net Leverage
Ratio, Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or Consolidated EBITDA-based permission, as
applicable) and for purposes of subsequent calculations of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated
Net Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or Consolidated EBITDA-based
permission, as applicable, the Reserved Indebtedness Amount shall be deemed to be Incurred and
outstanding, whether or not such amount is actually outstanding, for so long as such commitments are
outstanding or (b) be determined on the date such amount is borrowed pursuant to any such facility or
increased commitment; and

(9) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to
the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original
issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the
form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or
obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of
Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” Except as
otherwise specified, the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value
thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (b) the principal amount, or
liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness. For purposes of determining compliance
with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness Incurred under a Credit Facility, reborrowings of amounts
previously repaid pursuant to “cash sweep” provisions or any similar provisions under a Credit Facility that
provide that Indebtedness is deemed to be repaid daily (or otherwise periodically), including any revolving
indebtedness, shall only be deemed for purposes of this covenant to have been Incurred on the date such
Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on the date of any subsequent reborrowing thereof.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary
shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not
permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the
Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency
shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was
Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or, at the option of the Issuer, first committed (or first Incurred,
whichever yields the lower Euro Equivalent), in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit
facility; _provided_ that; (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a
currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be
exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such eurodenominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded, so long as the principal amount of such
Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the definition of Refinancing
Indebtedness; (b) the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue
Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if any
such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect
to the euro) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness
expressed in euro will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement.

208


-----

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result
of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance
other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated
based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is
denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor will incur any Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt) that is contractually
subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor unless such
Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and the applicable Guarantee, if
any, on substantially identical terms; provided, however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually
subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of
being unsecured or by virtue of being secured with different collateral or by virtue of being secured on a junior
priority basis or by virtue of the application of waterfall or other payment ordering provisions affecting different
tranches of Indebtedness. No Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment
to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being
secured on a first or junior Lien basis.

extent such cash, property or assets or marketable securities was used to reduce the Consolidated

Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Issuer or such

For the purposes of calculating “Consolidated EBITDA” pro forma effect shall be given to Consolidated

If any Investment or Restricted Payment would be permitted pursuant to one or more provisions described above
and/or one or more of the exceptions contained in the definition of “Permitted Payment” or “Permitted
Investment” (or any other definition used in this covenant or such definitions), the Issuer may, at its sole
discretion, divide and classify such Investment or Restricted Payment in any manner that complies with this
covenant or such definition and may later reclassify in whole or in part any such Investment or Restricted
Payment (based on circumstances existing on the date of such reclassification) in whole or in part at any time,
so long as the Investment or Restricted Payment (as so reclassified) would be permitted to be made in reliance
on the applicable exception as of the date of such reclassification.

###### Limitation on Liens

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or suffer
to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary of the
Issuer), whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any income or
profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien the “Initial Lien”), except (a) in the case
of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral, (1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets
that are not Permitted Liens if the Notes and the Indenture (or a Guarantee of the Notes in the case of Liens of a
Guarantor) are (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) directly secured equally and ratably with, or prior to,
in the case of Liens with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for
so long as such Indebtedness is so secured, and (b), in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral,
Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Notes will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged
upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates, and (ii) otherwise as set forth under “—
_Security—Release of Liens.”_

For the purposes of determining compliance with this covenant and for the purposes of the definitions of
“Permitted Liens” and “Permitted Collateral Liens,” in the event that a Lien meets the criteria of more than one
of the categories or exceptions contained in the definition of, as the case may be, “Permitted Liens” or “Permitted
Collateral Liens” (or any other definition used in this covenant or such definitions), as applicable, the Issuer may,
at its sole discretion, divide and classify such Lien in any manner that complies with this covenant or such
definition and may later divide and/or reclassify any such Lien at any time and in any manner that complies with
this covenant or such definition.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of the
Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such
Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such
Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms,

215


-----

accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference, in each case with respect to such Indebtedness, and
increases in the amount of Indebtedness resulting solely from fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or

###### Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit to exist
or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted
Subsidiary to:

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock to the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary or pay any Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,

provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to
dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the
application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such
an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) the Indenture, the Notes, any Credit Facility (including the
Super Senior Facilities), the Security Documents, any Guarantee and any Intercreditor Agreement and
Additional Intercreditor Agreement or (b) any other agreement or instrument with respect to the Issuer
and its Subsidiaries, in each case, in effect at or entered into on the Issue Date (including the Indenture,
the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents or any related security documents); and
(in all cases) any amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings,
replacements or refinancings of any such agreements or arrangements referred to in this clause (1)
provided that such encumbrances and restrictions are not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole,
with respect to dividend and other payment restrictions than those contained in those agreements as at the
Issue Date (as determined in good faith by the Issuer);

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating to any
Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person entered into on or before the date on which such Person was
acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary, or on which such agreement or instrument is assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred
as consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the transaction
or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was
acquired by the Issuer or was merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary entered into or in connection with such transaction) and outstanding on such date;
_provided that, for the purposes of this clause (2), if another Person is the Successor Issuer or Guarantor_
(each as defined under “—Merger and Consolidation”), any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or
instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed by the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the Successor Issuer or Successor Guarantor, as
applicable;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a refinancing of
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument referred to in
clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3) (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in any
amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this
paragraph or this clause (3); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to

216


-----

such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less favorable in any
material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the
Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other
modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer);

(4) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or asset
that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment or transfer of any lease,
license or other contract;

(b) contained in mortgages, charges, pledges or other security agreements permitted under the
Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted under the
Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict the transfer of the property or
assets subject to such mortgages, charges, pledges or other security agreements; or

(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in any
reciprocal easement agreements of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capitalized Lease
Obligations permitted under the Indenture, in each case, that impose encumbrances or restrictions on the
property so acquired, or any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to a joint venture agreement that imposes
restrictions on the distribution or transfer of the assets or Capital Stock of the joint venture;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any of its property or assets)
imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect sale or disposition to a Person of
all, or substantially all, the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary (or the property or assets
that are subject to such restriction) pending the closing of such sale or disposition;

(7) customary provisions in leases, licenses, joint venture agreements and other similar agreements and
instruments entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(8) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable rule,
regulation or order, or required by any regulatory authority;

agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(10) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Currency Agreements, Interest Rate Agreements or

(11) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument (a) relating to any
Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if the encumbrances and restrictions contained
in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Holders of
the Notes than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Indenture or the Super Senior
Facilities, together with the security documents associated therewith, or the Intercreditor Agreement, in
each case, as in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) as is customary in comparable financings (as determined
in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer) or where the Issuer determines that
such encumbrance or restriction will not adversely affect in any material respect the Issuer’s ability to
make principal or interest payments on the Notes or (b) constituting an Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

(12) restrictions effected in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing that, in the good faith
determination of the Board of Directors or, an Officer or of the Issuer, are necessary or advisable to effect
such Qualified Receivables Financing; or

(13) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any lien permitted under “—Limitation on Liens.”

###### Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any Asset Disposition unless:

(1) the consideration the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives (including by way of relief from, or by
any Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) for such Asset Disposition
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap) is not less
than the fair market value of the assets sold (as determined by the Issuer’s Board of Directors); and

(2) except where the Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75% of the consideration the Issuer
or such Restricted Subsidiary receives in respect of such Asset Disposition or series of related Asset
Dispositions consists of:

(i) cash (including any Net Cash Proceeds received from the conversion within 180 days of such Asset
Disposition of securities, notes or other obligations received in consideration of such Asset
Disposition);

(ii) Cash Equivalents;

(iii) the assumption by the purchaser of (x) any liabilities recorded on the Issuer’s or such Restricted
Subsidiary’s consolidated balance sheet or the notes thereto (or, if Incurred since the date of the
latest balance sheet, that would be recorded on the next balance sheet) (other than Subordinated
Indebtedness), as a result of which neither the Issuer, nor any of the Restricted Subsidiaries remains
obligated in respect of such liabilities or (y) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is no
longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, if the Issuer and each other
Restricted Subsidiary is released from any guarantee of such Indebtedness as a result of such Asset
Disposition;

(iv) Replacement Assets;

(v) any Capital Stock or assets of the kind referred to in clause (D) or (F) in the second paragraph of
this covenant;

(vi) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor received from Persons who
are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, but only to the extent that such Indebtedness (i) has
been extinguished by the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor and (ii) is not Subordinated
Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor;

(vii) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,
having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash
Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at any one time outstanding, not to exceed
the greater of €36 million and 30% of Consolidated EBITDA (with the fair market value of each
issue of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without
giving effect to subsequent changes in value); or

(viii) a combination of the consideration specified in clauses (i) through (vii) of this clause (2).

If the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Disposition, the Net Cash Proceeds of the Asset
Disposition received by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, within 365 days (or 545 days in the circumstances
described in clause (H) below) of the later of (i) the date of completion of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the
receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds, may be used by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary to:

(A) (i) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph
of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or any Refinancing Indebtedness in
respect thereof, (ii) unless included in (A)(i), prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Notes or Indebtedness
that is secured by a Lien on the Collateral and that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes,
(iii) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Indebtedness that is not subordinated in right of payment to the

218


-----

any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor (in each case other than Subordinated
Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor or Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary);
_provided_ that the Issuer shall prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Public Debt (other than the Notes)
pursuant to clause (ii) only if the Issuer either (1) reduces the aggregate principal amount of the Notes on
an equal and ratable basis with any such Indebtedness by redeeming Notes or by purchasing Notes through
open-market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions at market prices or (2) makes (at such time
or in compliance with this covenant) an offer to Holders to purchase their Notes in accordance with the
provisions set forth below for an Asset Disposition Offer for an aggregate principal amount of Notes equal
to the proportion that (x) the total aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding bears to (y) the sum
total aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding plus the total aggregate principal amount
outstanding of such Indebtedness (other than the Notes);

(B) (a) purchase any series of Notes pursuant to an offer to all Holders of such Notes at a purchase price in
cash equal to at least 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of
relevant record on the record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) (to the
extent Holders elect not to tender their Notes for such purchase, the amount of Net Available Cash equal
to such amount not tendered shall not increase the amount of Excess Proceeds (as defined below)); or (b)
redeem any series of Notes pursuant to the redemption provisions of the Indenture;

(C) invest in any Replacement Assets;

(D) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Similar Business, if, after
giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Similar Business is or becomes a Restricted
Subsidiary;

(E) make a capital expenditure;

(F) acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock and cash or Cash Equivalents) that are used or useful in a
Similar Business;

(G) consummate any combination of the foregoing; or

(H) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Available Cash pursuant to clause (A), (C), (D), (E) or
(F) of this paragraph or a combination thereof,

_provided that, a binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Available Cash_
from the date of such commitment until the earlier of (x) the date on which such investment is
consummated and (y) the 180th day following the expiration of the aforementioned 365 day period, if the
investment has not been consummated by that date; provided, further that the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary may elect to invest pursuant to clauses (C) through (F) of the above paragraph (or a
combination of the foregoing) prior to receiving the Net Available Cash (provided that such investment
shall be made no earlier than the earliest of notice to the Trustee of the relevant Asset Disposition,
execution of a definitive agreement for the relevant Asset Disposition or consummation of the relevant
Asset Disposition) and deem the amount so invested to be applied pursuant to and in accordance with
clauses (C) through (F) (or a combination of the foregoing).

The amount of such Net Available Cash not so used as set forth in this paragraph shall constitute “Excess
_Proceeds” in the following amounts and such determination may be made by the Issuer on any date on or after_
such Asset Disposition at the Issuer’s election (but in each case on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such
Asset Disposition and the use of proceeds therefrom):

(1) if the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio exceeds 4.25 to 1.00, 100% of such Net Available Cash; or

(2) if the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries exceeds 3.75 to
1.00 but does not exceed 4.25 to 1.00, 50% of such Net Available Cash; or

219


-----

(3) if the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries does not exceed
3.75 to 1.00, 0% of such Net Available Cash,

and any Net Available Cash that will not constitute Excess Proceeds pursuant to this paragraph shall be
immediately available to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries for any purposes permitted by the
Indenture without regard to the periods specified in the second paragraph of this covenant.

Pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash, the Issuer may temporarily reduce revolving credit
borrowings or otherwise invest or use such Net Available Cash in any manner that is not prohibited by the terms
of the Indenture. To the extent that following or in connection with an Asset Disposition the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary has elected to prepay, repay or purchase any amount of Notes or other Senior Secured
Indebtedness (other than the Notes), in each case, at a price of no less than 100% of the principal amount thereof,
and has extended such offer to the Holders of the Notes on at least a pari passu basis to the extent the creditors
in respect of such Senior Secured Indebtedness (including the Holders) elect not to tender their Senior Secured
Indebtedness for such prepayment, repayment or purchase, the Issuer will be deemed to have applied an amount
of Net Available Cash equal to such amount not tendered under this paragraph, and such amount shall not increase
the amount of Excess Proceeds (such amount, together with the aggregate amount described under the sixth
paragraph of this covenant, the “Declined Proceeds”).

On the 366th day (or the 546th day if a binding commitment as described in clause (H) is entered into) after an
Asset Disposition, or such earlier time if the Issuer elects, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds
the greater of €36 million and 30% of Consolidated EBITDA, the Issuer will be required within 10 Business
Days thereof to make an offer (“Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to
all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes
and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of
the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any Pari
Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and 100% of the
principal amount of Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not
including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements
governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof in the case of the Notes.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, any remaining Excess
Proceeds shall constitute “Declined Proceeds” and the Issuer may use such proceeds for any purpose not
otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset
Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively,
exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness to be repaid or purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of
tendered Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such
Indebtedness not denominated in euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal
amounts into their Euro Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset
Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of
Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Cash Proceeds payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a currency
other than the currency in which the relevant Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of
such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Notes are denominated that
is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net Cash Proceeds into such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of not less than 20
Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later than five Business
Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset Disposition Purchase Date”), the
Issuer will purchase the principal amount of Notes and, to the extent it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness required
to be repaid or purchased by it pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if less than

220


-----

the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly
tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment, on a
pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness
or portions of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the
Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and
in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will
deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof were accepted for
payment by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of this covenant. The Issuer or the Paying Agent, as the case
may be, will promptly (but, in any case, not later than five Business Days after termination of the Asset
Disposition Offer Period) deliver to each tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase price of the Notes
so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Issuer for purchase, and the
Issuer will promptly issue a new Note (or amend the applicable Global Note), and the Trustee (or an
authenticating agent), upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, will authenticate and deliver (or
cause to be transferred by book-entry) such new Note to such Holder, in a principal amount equal to any
unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount
with a minimum denomination of €100,000. Any Note not so accepted will be promptly delivered (or transferred
by book-entry) by the Issuer to the Holder thereof.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and
any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to the Indenture. To
the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the
Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached
its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

###### Limitation on Affiliate Transactions

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into or
conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any
property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer (any such transaction or series of related
transactions being an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of €6 million
and 5% of Consolidated EBITDA unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable
transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such transaction
in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of €18 million
and 15% of Consolidated EBITDA, the terms of such transaction or series of related transactions have
been approved by a resolution of the majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors of
the Issuer resolving that such transaction complies with clause (1) above.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments,” any Permitted Payments (other than pursuant to clause (9)(b)(ii) of the third_
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”) or any Permitted
Investment (other than Permitted Investments as defined in paragraphs (1)(b) and (2) of the definition
thereof);

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, or other
payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or entering into,
or maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan, program,

the Issue Date or described in “Related Party Transactions” in the Offering Memorandum, as these
agreements and instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed, replaced or
refinanced from time to time in accordance with the other terms of this covenant or to the extent not more
disadvantageous to the Holders in any material respect, and (iii) the entry into and performance of any
registration rights or other listing agreement;

which the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or any Parent is required or permitted to file a consolidated tax
return, or the formation and maintenance of any consolidated group for tax, accounting or cash pooling
or management purposes in the ordinary course of business, provided that any such consolidated group
arrangement does not permit or require cash payment by the Issuer to any Parent in excess of the amount
of Tax that would be payable by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis;

(8) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services (including,
without limitation, pursuant to joint venture arrangements), in each case in the ordinary course of business,
which are fair to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of the
Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less
favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Issuer or an Associate or similar entity that would constitute an Affiliate

(iii) an operating and financial review of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of
the consolidated financial condition, results of operations, consolidated EBITDA and material
changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Issuer;

(iv) a discussion of material changes in material debt instruments since the most recent report; and

(v) material subsequent events and any material changes to the risk factors disclosed in the most recent
annual report, provided that the information described in clauses (iv) and (v) may be provided in
the footnotes to such financial statements; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Issuer announces publicly or any acquisition,
disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction that is material to the Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or a senior executive officer or director changes at the Issuer or a change
in auditors of the Issuer, a report containing a description of such event.

So long as the Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will also, within five Business Days after furnishing to the Trustee
the annual and quarterly reports required by clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this “Reports” covenant,
hold a conference call to discuss such reports and the results of operations for the relevant reporting period. The
Issuer shall provide notice of the conference call no fewer than three Business Days prior to the date of the
conference call required to be held in accordance with this paragraph, announcing the time and date of such
conference call and either including all information necessary to access the call or directing parties to contact the
appropriate person at the Issuer to obtain such information.

In addition, the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of such parties,
any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for so long as the
Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by persons who are not “affiliates” under the Securities
Act.

Contemporaneously with the furnishing of each such report discussed above, the Issuer will also post such report
on the Issuer’s website.

The Issuer shall also make available to Holders and prospective holders of the Notes copies of all reports
furnished to the Trustee on the Issuer’s website and if and so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of
The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited and to the extent that the rules and regulations of The
International Stock Exchange Authority Limited so require, by posting such reports on the official website of
The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (www.tisegroup.com/). Notwithstanding the above, the
Issuer will be deemed to have provided such reports to the Trustee, the Holders and prospective holders of the
Notes if such reports referenced above in clauses (1), (2) and (3) have been posted on the Issuer’s website.

224


-----

All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of such
report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis for
the periods presented, except as may otherwise be described in such information; provided, however, that the
reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods
on a basis that applied to such periods. No report need include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries
of the Issuer or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical
disclosure not of a type included in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, the reports set forth above will not
be required to contain any reconciliation to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

To the extent comparable prior period financial information of the Issuer does not exist, the comparable prior
period financial information of the Company or special purpose financial information of the Issuer (incorporating
such Company financial information) may be provided in lieu thereof.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may satisfy its obligations under clauses (1) and (2) of the first
paragraph of this covenant by delivering the corresponding consolidated annual and quarterly reports of any
Parent. To the extent that material differences exist between the management, business, assets, shareholding or
results of operations or financial condition of the Issuer or any Parent that is the reporting entity (if applicable),
the annual and quarterly reports shall include an explanation and an unaudited reconciliation of such material
differences. Following an IPO on the Capital Stock of the Issuer or any Parent or Subsidiary thereof and/or the
listing of such Capital Stock on an internationally recognized stock exchange, the requirements of this covenant
shall be considered to have been fulfilled if the IPO Entity complies with the reporting requirements of such
stock exchange and reports consolidated EBITDA and, if the IPO Entity is different than the Issuer following
such IPO, and material differences exist between the assets, results of operations or financial condition of the
IPO Entity and the Issuer, then the reports shall include an explanation and an unaudited reconciliation of such
material differences.

At any time that any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the
Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first paragraph of this “—Reports”
covenant will include (i) a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in
the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of
the Issuer or (ii) stand-alone audited or unaudited financial statements, as the case may be, of such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or Unrestricted Subsidiaries, together with an unaudited reconciliation to the financial information of
the Issuer and its subsidiaries, which reconciliation shall include the following items: revenues, consolidated
EBITDA, net income, cash, total assets, total debt, shareholder equity, capital expenditures and interest expense.

For the purposes of this covenant, IFRS shall be deemed to be IFRS as in effect from time to time, without giving
effect to the proviso in the definition thereof.

All reports provided pursuant to this “—Reports” covenant shall be made in the English language.

In the event that (i) the Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports required by
Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Issuer elects to provide to the Trustee reports which, if filed with the SEC,
would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Issuer) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of
the Exchange Act (other than the provision of U.S. GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or information as
to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Trustee such
annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the
SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d). Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Issuer will be
deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture to the contrary, any failure to comply with this covenant shall be
automatically cured, prior to acceleration of the relevant breach, when the Issuer or any direct or indirect Parent

225


-----

of the Issuer, as the case may be, makes available all required reports to the Trustee or makes such required
reports available on the Issuer’s website (or a website of a Parent or Subsidiary of the Issuer).

Delivery of the above reports to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee’s receipt of such
reports will not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from
information contained therein, including the Issuer’s or any other parties’ compliance with any of its covenants
in the Indenture (as to which the Trustee will be entitled to rely exclusively on Officer’s Certificates that are
delivered).

###### Merger and Consolidation

 The Issuer

The Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose
of all or substantially all the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in one
transaction or a series of related transactions to, any Person, unless:

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Issuer”) will be a Person organized and
existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union, the United Kingdom or the United
States of America, any State of the United States or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province of
Canada, Norway or Switzerland and the Successor Issuer (if not the Issuer) will expressly assume, (a) by
supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee, all the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture and (b) all obligations of the
Issuer under the Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security Documents, as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the Successor Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Successor Issuer as a result of such transaction
as having been Incurred by the Successor Issuer or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no
Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Successor Issuer would be able to Incur
at least an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio contained in the
first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b) the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio would not be less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to
the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply
with the Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture (if any) has
been duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal, valid and binding agreement enforceable
against the Successor Issuer (in each case, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee),
_provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any_
matters of fact.

Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is deemed to be
Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of any such transaction
undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto, shall be
deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Issuer, which properties and assets,
if held by the Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties and
assets of the Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the
properties and assets of the Issuer.

The Successor Issuer will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the
Issuer under the Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the predecessor company
will not be released from its obligations under the Indenture or the Notes.

226


-----

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve
“all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this “—Merger and
_Consolidation” covenant) shall not apply to (i) any transactions which constitute an Asset Disposition if the_
Issuer has complied with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”
or (ii) the creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary or (iii) the Post-Closing Merger.

###### Guarantors

No Guarantor (other than a Guarantor whose guarantee is to be released in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement) may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving
corporation);

(2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of, all or substantially all of the assets of such
Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one transaction or a series of related
transactions, to any Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into it unless:

(A) the other Person is the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or becomes a
Guarantor;

(B) (1) either (x) a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or transferee
Person (the “Successor Guarantor”) expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor
under its Guarantee and the Indenture (pursuant to a supplemental indenture executed and
delivered in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee); and (2) immediately after giving effect
to the transaction, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing; or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger)
of a Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of a Guarantor (in each
case other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Indenture,

_provided, however, that the prohibition in clauses (1), (2) and (3) of this paragraph shall not apply to the extent_
that compliance with paragraphs (A) and (B)(1) could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation of
statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules,
capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws rules or regulations (or analogous
restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case
of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a
Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3)
any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out of pocket
expenses.

The provisions set forth in this “—Merger and Consolidation” covenant shall not restrict (and shall not apply
to): (i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor from consolidating with, merging or liquidating into or
transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer, a Guarantor or any other Restricted
Subsidiary; (ii) a Guarantor from merging or liquidating into or transferring all or part of its properties and assets
to the Issuer or another Guarantor; (iii) any consolidation or merger of the Issuer into any Guarantor; provided
that, if the Issuer is not the surviving entity of such merger or consolidation, the relevant Guarantor will assume
the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable, and clauses (1) and (4) under the heading
“—The Issuer” shall apply to such transaction (iv) a Permitted Reorganization and (v) the Issuer or a Guarantor
changing legal domicile or legal form or consolidating into or merging or combining with an Affiliate
incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of such entity, reincorporating such

227


-----

entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such entity; provided, however, that clauses (1), (2)
and (4) under the heading “—The Issuer” or clauses (3)(A) and (3)(B) under the heading “—Guarantors,” as the
case may be, shall apply to any such transaction.

###### Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status

If, on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no Default or
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning on that day and
continuing until such time, if any, at which the Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (the “Reversion
**Date”), the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply to the Notes:**

(1) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(2) “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

(3) “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(4) “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

(5) “—Impairment of Security Interest”;

(6) “—Future Guarantees”;

(7) “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”; and

(8) the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Merger and
_Consolidation—The Issuer,”_

and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be
applicable to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first day on
which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard
to actions of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during the continuance of the
Suspension Event, and no action taken prior to the Reversion Date will constitute a Default or Event of Default.
The “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date
of the Indenture but not during the continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness
Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue
Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” In addition, the Indenture will also permit, without causing a Default or
Event of Default, the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any contractual commitments or take
actions in the future after any date on which the Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long as the
contractual commitments were entered into during the Suspension Event and not in anticipation of the Notes no
longer having an Investment Grade Status. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes that
the conditions set forth in the first paragraph under this caption have been satisfied, _provided_ that, no such
notification shall be a condition for the suspension or reversion of the covenants described under this caption to
be effective. The Trustee shall not be obliged to notify the Holders of such event. There can be no assurance that
the Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Status.

###### Impairment of Security Interest

The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, and the Parent shall not, take or knowingly
or negligently omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security Interest
with respect to the Collateral (it being understood, subject to the proviso below, that the Incurrence of Permitted
Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interest with respect
to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any
Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the
Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral, except that (i) the Issuer

228


-----

and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Permitted Collateral Liens and may effect a Permitted Reorganization
and an IPO Pushdown or IPO Release, and the Collateral may be discharged and released and retaken, and the
applicable Security Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise
modified, replaced or released, if applicable, in accordance with the Indenture, the applicable Security
Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (ii) the applicable Security
Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified, replaced or
released, from time to time to (a) cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect or inconsistency therein, (b)
comply, or in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
(c) add Collateral, (d) evidence the succession of another Person to the Issuer or any security provider and the
assumption of such successor of the obligations under the Indenture, the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement and/or
the Security Documents, in each case, including in accordance with the terms under “—Merger and Consolidation,”
(e) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of the appointment of a successor Trustee or Security Agent and (f)
in any manner that does not adversely affect Holders of the Notes in any material respect, and (iii) the Issuer and
its Restricted Subsidiaries may discharge and release Security Interests with respect to the Collateral in connection
with the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization and an IPO Pushdown or IPO Release; provided, however,
that in the case of clause (i) above, except with respect to any discharge or release in accordance with the
Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Incurrence of Permitted
Collateral Liens or any action expressly permitted by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents may not be amended, extended, renewed, restated,
supplemented, released and retaken, if applicable, or otherwise modified or replaced, unless contemporaneously
with any such action, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee and the Security Agent, either (1) a solvency opinion, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and the Security Agent from an Independent Financial
Advisor confirming the solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or
replacement, (2) a certificate from the Board of Directors of the relevant Person which confirms the solvency of
the person granting such Security Interest after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement or (3) an Opinion of Counsel,
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and the Security Agent, confirming that, after giving
effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release,
modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Security Documents, so amended, extended,
renewed, restated, supplemented, released, modified or replaced are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any
limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise
subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release,
modification or replacement.

In the event that the Issuer complies with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent
shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such amendments without the need for
instructions from the Holders.

###### Future Guarantees

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this covenant, no Restricted Subsidiary shall Guarantee the
Indebtedness outstanding under the Super Senior Facilities, any other Indebtedness with an aggregate outstanding
principal amount in excess of the greater of €30 million and 25% of Consolidated EBITDA or any other Public
Debt, in each case of the Issuer or a Guarantor unless such Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor on
the date on which the Guarantee is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental
indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Guarantee, which Guarantee will be senior
to or pari passu with such Restricted Subsidiary’s guarantee of such other Indebtedness; provided, however, that
such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be obligated to become such a Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the
Incurrence of such Guarantee is contrary to the Agreed Security Principles or the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, or could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation of statutory
limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, capital
maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of

229


-----

any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted
Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted
Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost,
expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out of pocket
expenses. At the option of the Issuer, any Guarantee may contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the extent
reasonably necessary.

Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under “—Release of the Guarantees.”
A Guarantee of a Guarantor may also be released at the option of the Issuer if at the date of such release either
(i) there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which
could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture if such Guarantor had not been designated as a
Guarantor, or (ii) there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date
and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture as at the date of such release if such
Guarantor were not designated as a Guarantor as at that date. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take
all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Guarantee in accordance with these provisions,
subject to customary protections and indemnifications.

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the
Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other
things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial
assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and
similar principles. By virtue of such limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be
significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no
obligation under its Guarantee.

The validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of each Guarantor
will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in “Risk Factors” and “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” in the Offering_
Memorandum.

###### Release of the Guarantees

The Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and release:

(1) upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital Stock of the
relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company) or the sale or disposition of all
or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary)
otherwise permitted by the Indenture;

(2) upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(3) upon (i) defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and
_Discharge” or (ii) the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the Issuer and the_
Guarantors under the Indenture and the Notes;

(4) with respect to a Guarantor that is not a Significant Subsidiary, so long as no Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, to the extent that such Guarantor is unconditionally released and discharged from its
liability with respect to the Super Senior Facilities and is not otherwise required to be a Guarantor pursuant
to the covenant described under “— Future Guarantees”;

(5) in accordance with an enforcement action pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

(6) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(7) as described in the covenant described under “—Future Guarantees”;

230


-----

(8) pursuant to a Permitted Reorganization or as a result of a transaction permitted by “—Merger and
_Consolidation—Guarantors,” or in connection with a transaction permitted by “—IPO Pushdown;” or_

(9) upon the solvent liquidation or winding-up of a Guarantor.

At the request of the Issuer, the Trustee shall take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or
waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release
of a Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each
of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee without the consent of the Holders. Neither the
Trustee nor the Issuer will be required to make a notation on the Notes to reflect any such release, termination or
discharge.

###### Additional Intercreditor Agreements

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the Incurrence by the Issuer or its
Restricted Subsidiaries of any Indebtedness permitted pursuant to the covenant described under “— Limitation
_on Indebtedness” or as contemplated by the Intercreditor Agreement, the Issuer, the relevant Restricted_
Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their
duly authorized Representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) or a
restatement, amendment or other modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same
terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders), including containing
substantially the same terms with respect to release of Guarantees and priority and release of the Security Interest;
_provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee_
or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights,
duties, liabilities, indemnifications or immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Indenture or the
Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders, the Trustee
and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or any Security Document to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect
or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such
agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement
(including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of
provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes), (3) add Restricted
Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Notes
(including Additional Notes), (5) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure
Additional Notes, (6) implement any Permitted Liens or Permitted Collateral Liens, (7) amend the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof or (8) make any other
change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect. The Issuer shall
not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement
without the consent of the Holders of the majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding,
except as otherwise permitted below under “—Amendments and Waivers” or as permitted by the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee
and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal
obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect
their respective rights, duties, liabilities, indemnifications or immunities under the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the Holders to the payment,
repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations
subordinated to the Notes thereby; provided, however, that such transaction would comply with the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

231


-----

The Indenture also will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and
accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
(whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have
directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement. A copy of
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall be made available for inspection
during normal business hours on any Business Day upon prior written request at our offices or at the offices of
the listing agent.

###### Maintenance of Listing

The Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the listing of the Notes on the Official List of
The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited for so long as such Notes are outstanding; provided that if
at any time the Issuer determines that it will not maintain such listing, it will obtain prior to the delisting of the
Notes from the Official List of The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited, and thereafter use its
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain, a listing of such Notes on another recognized stock exchange.

###### Lines of Business

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, engage in any business other than a Similar
Business, except to such extent as would not be material to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a

Any Applicable Metric to be determined in connection with an Applicable Transaction (including whether a
Default or Event of Default is continuing or would result from the Applicable Transaction) may, at the Issuer’s
election (which election the Issuer may revoke and re-make at any time and from time to time), be determined
as at any Applicable Test Date, in each case, where relevant and at the Issuer’s election (which election the Issuer
may revoke and re-make at any time and from time to time), based upon the financial position as at the Applicable
Reporting Date immediately preceding such Applicable Test Date. If the Issuer elects to determine any
Applicable Metric as of any Applicable Test Date, such Applicable Metric shall be calculated on a pro forma
basis after giving effect to such Applicable Transactions and to any other Applicable Transactions that have
occurred up to (and including) such Applicable Test Date as if they occurred on the first day of the most recently
completed Relevant Period to which the Applicable Reporting Date relates; _provided that the pro forma_
calculation may exclude any non-recurring fees, costs and expenses attributable to any Applicable Transaction.

If compliance with an Applicable Metric is established in accordance with the preceding paragraph, such
Applicable Metric shall be deemed to have been complied with (or satisfied) for all purposes under the Indenture;
_provided that: (a) the Issuer may elect (which election the Issuer may revoke and re-make at any time and from_
time to time) to recalculate any Applicable Metric on the basis of a more recent Applicable Test Date, in which
case, such date of redetermination shall thereafter be deemed to be the relevant Applicable Test Date for purposes
of such Applicable Metric; and (b) save as contemplated in paragraph (a) above, compliance with any Applicable
Metric shall not be determined or tested at any time after the relevant Applicable Test Date for such transaction
and any actions or transactions related thereto.

If any Applicable Metric for which compliance was determined or tested as of an Applicable Test Date would at
any time after the Applicable Test Date have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been complied with as a
result of fluctuations in such Applicable Metric (or any other Applicable Metric), such Applicable Metric will
not be deemed to have been exceeded or failed to have been complied with as a result of such fluctuations.

If any related requirements and conditions (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of
Default) for which compliance or satisfaction was determined or tested as of any Applicable Test Date would at
any time after the Applicable Test Date not have been complied with or satisfied (including due to the occurrence
or continuation of a Default or Event of Default), such requirements and conditions will not be deemed to have
been failed to be complied with or satisfied (and such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed not to have
occurred or be continuing).

232


-----

If any Applicable Metric is determined by reference to the greater of a fixed amount (the “Numerical
**Permission”) and a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA (the “Grower Permission”) and the Grower**
Permission of the Applicable Metric exceeds the applicable Numerical Permission at any time, the Numerical
Permission shall be deemed to be increased to the highest amount of the Grower Permission reached from time
to time and shall not subsequently be reduced as a result of any decrease in the Grower Permission.

For any relevant Applicable Metric set by reference to a fiscal year, a calendar year, a four-quarter period, a
twelve-month period or any other similar annual period (each an “Annual Period”):

(i) at the option of the Issuer, the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric during such
Annual Period may be increased by: (A) an amount equal to 100% of the difference (if positive) between
the permitted amount in the immediately preceding Annual Period and the amount thereof actually used
or applied by the Group during such preceding Annual Period (the “Carry Forward Amount”); and/or
(B) an amount equal to 100% of the permitted amount in the immediately following Annual Period and
the permitted amount in such immediately following Annual Period shall be reduced by such
corresponding amount (the “Carry Back Amount”); and

(ii) to the extent that the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric during such Annual
Period is increased in accordance with clause (i) above, any usage of such Applicable Metric during
such Annual Period shall be deemed to be applied in the following order: (A) first, against the Carry
Forward Amount; (B) second, against the maximum amount so permitted during such Annual Period
prior to any increase in accordance with clause (i) above; and (C) third, against the Carry Back Amount.

For the avoidance of doubt, subject to clause (8) of the third paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation
_on Indebtedness,” any undrawn commitments for Indebtedness (including the Super Senior Facilities (which_
includes the Pension Guarantee Facility and the Guarantee Facilities) and any ancillary facility thereunder) shall
be disregarded for the purposes of testing any Applicable Metric.

###### Events of Default

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest or Additional Amounts on any Note issued under the Indenture when
due and payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under the
Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon
declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or (following the Post-Closing Merger) the Parent
to comply for 60 days after written notice by the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount
of the outstanding Notes with its other agreements contained in the Indenture (other than a default in
performance, or breach, of a covenant or agreement which is specifically addressed in clauses (1) or (2)
above);

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there
may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries)
other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or
Guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at Stated Maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately upon
the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross acceleration
**provision”),**

233


-----

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of
any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of which has
been so accelerated, aggregates in excess of €25 million or more;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary or
group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial
statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the
“bankruptcy provisions”);

(6) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together
(as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries),
would constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of t €25 million
(exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability for), which
judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the judgment becomes final (the
“judgment default provision”);

(7) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect
(other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement,
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture and except through the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Trustee or Security Agent) with respect to Collateral having a fair market value
in excess of €10 million for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the
Indenture or the release of any such security interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents or any such
security interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Issuer shall assert in
writing that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable, and (in each case) any such Default
continues for 10 days; and

(8) any Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance
with the terms of such Guarantee or the Indenture) or is declared invalid or unenforceable in a judicial
proceeding or any Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations under its Guarantee and (in
each case) any such Default continues for 10 days.

However, a default under clause (3), (4) or (6) above will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or
the Holders of 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture notify the Issuer of the
default and, with respect to such clauses the Issuer does not cure such default within the time specified in such
clauses, as applicable, of this paragraph after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is continuing,
the Trustee by notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes
under the Indenture by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such
Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes under
the Indenture to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid
interest will be due and payable immediately. The Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any Default or
Event of Default unless a written notice of any event which is in fact such a default is received by a Responsible
Officer of the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and such notice references the Notes and the
Indenture. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in
clause (4) above under “–Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of
the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of
Default pursuant to clause (4) above shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness,
or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days
after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes
would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events
of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest on the Notes that became due solely because of
the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.

234


-----

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any,
and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any
declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may
not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all past
or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or
Additional Amounts, if any) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences
if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and
is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture
at the request or direction of any of the Holders, unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee, and the Trustee
has received, indemnity and/or security (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to the Trustee against any
loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no
Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes, unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue
the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability
or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer
of security and/or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a
direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given
the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, of which a
responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the
Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in
the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law
or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that
would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be
entitled to indemnification and/or security (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to it in its sole
discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. Prior to the occurrence of
an Event of Default, the Trustee will have no obligation to monitor compliance by the Issuer with the Indenture.
The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and a responsible officer of the Trustee is
informed in writing in accordance with the terms of the Indenture of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee
must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the
case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may
withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders.
The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s
Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during
the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof,
written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what
action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

235


-----

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection
with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure
to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any
further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed
in the covenant entitled “Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant
to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required
by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed
period specified in the Indenture.

The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but
only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured (including by way of pre-funding) to its satisfaction. It may not
be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances
the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for
Holders to take action directly.

###### Amendments and Waivers

Subject to certain exceptions, the Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified with
the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents
obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) and, subject to certain
exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders
of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection
with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes). However, without the consent of Holders holding
not less than 90% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes affected, then outstanding, an amendment
or waiver may not, with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, waiver or
modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Note or change the time at which any Note may
be redeemed, in each case as described above under “—Optional Redemption”;

(5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Note;

(6) impair the right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or with respect
to such Holder’s Notes;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “—Withholding Taxes” that adversely
affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends the terms of such Notes
in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an
exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder, unless the Issuer or
the applicable Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(8) release all or substantially all of the security interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the
Collateral other than in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture or the applicable Security Documents;

(9) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest or
Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by
the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment
default that resulted from such acceleration);

236


-----

(10) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Guarantee or the Indenture, except in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement any applicable Additional
Intercreditor Agreement; and

(11) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent described in
this sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Security Agent and
the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Notes Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer, or any Restricted
Subsidiary under any Notes Document;

(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any right or
power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or that
does not adversely affect the rights or benefits to the Trustee or any of the Holders in any material respect
under the Notes Documents;

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer
of the Issuer) for the issuance of Additional Notes;

(6) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Guarantee in accordance with the covenants
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “—Certain Covenants— Future
_Guarantees,” to add Guarantees with respect to the Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of the Notes,_
or to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Guarantee or Lien
(including the Collateral and the Security Documents) or any amendment in respect thereof with respect
to or securing the Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking or amendment is provided
for under the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Notes to any provision of this
“Description of the Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of the Notes” was intended
to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Notes;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee or Security Agent pursuant
to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee or Security Agent to any Notes
Document;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in
favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Super Senior Facilities, in any
property which is required by the Security Documents or the Super Senior Facilities (as in effect on the
Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required to be
granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a security interest in the Collateral for
the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such security interest is not prohibited by the
Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” is complied with; or

(10) as provided in “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements.”

In formulating its decision on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely absolutely on such
evidence as it deems necessary, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed
amendment of any Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed

237


-----

amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder of Notes given in
connection with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

###### Acts by Holders

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Notes have concurred in any
direction, waiver or consent, the Notes owned by the Issuer or by any Person directly or indirectly controlled, or
controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the Issuer will be disregarded and deemed not to
be outstanding.

###### Defeasance

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and the
Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain
obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and
indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning
issuing temporary Notes, registration of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of
an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the
Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate (other than with
respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate its and the Guarantors’ obligations under the covenants described under
“Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (1) and (2) of “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”) and
“—Change of Control” and the default provisions relating to such covenants described under “Events of Default”
above, the operation of the cross-default upon a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the
bankruptcy provisions with respect to the Issuer and Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision, the
guarantee provision and the security default provision described under “Events of Default” above (“covenant
**defeasance”).**

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of
its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not
be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to such Notes. If the Issuer exercises its covenant
defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event
of Default specified in clause (3), (4), (5) (with respect only to the Significant Subsidiaries), (6) or (7) under
“Events of Default” above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance trust”)
with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed as agent by the Trustee for this purpose) cash in euros
or euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a combination thereof sufficient for the payment of
principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must
comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that the beneficial owners of the Notes will not
recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and
defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner
and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and
in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United States must be based on a
ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating,
hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to customary
assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to legal
defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with;

238


-----

(4) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not constitute, or is
qualified as, a regulated investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended; and

(5) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee all other documents or other information that the Trustee may reasonably
require in connection with either defeasance option.

###### Satisfaction and Discharge

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except
as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Notes, as expressly provided for in the
Indenture) as to all outstanding Notes when: (1) either: (a) all the Notes previously authenticated and delivered
(other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes, and certain Notes for which provision for payment was
previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Paying
Agent for cancellation; or (b) all Notes not previously delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation (i) have
become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to
be called for redemption within one year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving
of notice of redemption by the Paying Agent in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has
deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another entity designated by the Trustee for this purpose),
money or euro-denominated European Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, as applicable, in an
amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Notes not previously delivered to the Paying
Agent for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Notes that
have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Issuer
has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; (4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable
instructions to the Trustee to apply the funds deposited towards the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the
redemption date, as the case may be; and (5) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and
an Opinion of Counsel each to the effect that all conditions precedent under the “Satisfaction and Discharge”
section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with,
_provided_ that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to
compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).

###### No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer or any of their respective Subsidiaries
or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor under the Notes
Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each
Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the
consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S.
federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

###### Concerning the Trustee

Deutsche Trustee Company Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will provide
that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has
received written notice in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Trustee will perform only such duties
as are set forth specifically in the Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default of which a responsible
officer of the Trustee has received written notice in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Trustee will
exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of care that a
prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain
from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the
Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any
such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Issuer
and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

239


-----

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced. Such terms
will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the then outstanding Note, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Issuer
and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated, or (b) becomes
incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any
Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six months may petition any court for removal of the
Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the
successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, taxes, expenses
incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising out of or in connection with
the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

###### Notices

For so long as any of the Notes are listed on The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited and the rules
of The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited so require, notices with respect to the Notes will be
published, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, on the official website of The International
Stock Exchange Authority Limited (www.tisegroup.com/). In addition, for so long as any Notes are represented
by Global Notes, all notices to Holders of the Notes will be delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer to Euroclear
and Clearstream.

All notices to Holders of the Notes will be validly given if mailed to them at their respective addresses in the
register of Holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more than
once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are mailed, such
notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after being so
mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or
other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed.
Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with
respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given,
whether or not the addressee receives it. For so long as any Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices to
Holders of the Notes may be delivered via Euroclear and Clearstream in lieu of notice via registered mail.

###### Prescription

Claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the Notes will
be prescribed 10 years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against the Issuer and the
Guarantors for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed five years after the applicable due date for
payment of interest.

###### Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions

The euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the Guarantors, if
any, under or in connection with the Notes and the Guarantees, if any, including damages. Any amount received
or recovered in a currency other than euro, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of
a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by any
Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a Guarantor will only
constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the euro amount which the
recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that
receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is
practicable to do so).

If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under any
Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors, if any, will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or

240


-----

the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors, if any, will indemnify the recipient or the
Trustee on a joint or several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency
indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Note or the
Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources of information used)
the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent
obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent
cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Note or the Trustee (other than
a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment,
order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or any Guarantee, or to
the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any eurodenominated restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a noneuro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such noneuro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

###### Listing

Application will be made to list the Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange Authority
Limited. There can be no assurance that the application to list the Notes on the Official List of The International
Stock Exchange Authority Limited will be approved and settlement of the Notes is not conditioned on obtaining
such listing.

###### Enforceability of Judgments

Since substantially all the assets of the Issuer are located outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the
United States against the Issuer, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest,
Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Notes, may not
be collectable within the United States.

###### Consent to Jurisdiction and Service

the Issuer will in the Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough
of Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State of New York, United States.

###### Governing Law

The Indenture and the Notes, and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. For the avoidance of doubt, the governing law
of the Indenture and the Notes may be amended with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal
amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender
offer or exchange offer for, Notes). The Intercreditor Agreement and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales.

“Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio” means, as of any date of determination, the ratio of (x) Consolidated Net
Leverage at such date to (y) the aggregate amount of Consolidated EBITDA for the Relevant Period ending on
the Applicable Reporting Date. In the event that the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries Incurs, assumes,
guarantees, repays, repurchases, redeems, retires, extinguishes, defeases or otherwise discharges any
Indebtedness subsequent to the commencement of the period for which the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio is
being calculated and on or prior to the Applicable Test Date or has caused any Reserved Indebtedness Amount
to be deemed to be Incurred during such period, then the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio will be calculated
giving pro forma effect (as determined in good faith by a responsible accounting or financial officer of the Issuer)
to such Incurrence, assumption, guarantee, repayment, repurchase, redemption, retirement, extinguishment,
defeasance or other discharge of Indebtedness, and the use of the proceeds therefrom, as if the same had occurred
at the beginning of the Relevant Period; _provided, however, that (other than in connection with making any_
Restricted Payment pursuant to clause (16) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments”) the pro forma calculation shall not give effect to (i) any_
Indebtedness Incurred on the Applicable Test Date pursuant to the provisions described in the second paragraph
under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (ii) the discharge on the Applicable Test Date of any
Indebtedness to the extent that such discharge results from the proceeds Incurred pursuant to the provisions
described in the second paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

In addition, for purposes of calculating the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio:

(1) acquisitions, Investments or New Projects (each, a “Purchase”) that have been made by the Issuer or any

Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries acquired by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries,
and including all related financing transactions and including increases in ownership of Subsidiaries
which are Restricted Subsidiaries, during the Relevant Period or subsequent to such period and on or prior
to the Applicable Test Date, or that are to be made on the Applicable Test Date, will be given pro forma
effect (as determined in good faith by a responsible accounting or financial officer of the Issuer and may
include the full run rate effect of cost savings, operating expense reductions, restructuring charges,
operating improvements, expenses, synergies or similar initiatives that are reasonably anticipated to be
realized within the next 24 months following the date of such calculation) as if they had occurred on the
first day of the Relevant Period; provided that, if definitive documentation has been entered into with
respect to a Purchase that is part of the transaction causing a calculation to be made hereunder,
Consolidated EBITDA for such period will be calculated after giving pro forma effect to such Purchase
(including the full run rate effect of cost savings, operating expense reductions, restructuring charges,
operating improvements, expenses, synergies or similar initiatives that are reasonably anticipated to be

252


-----

realized within the next 24 months following the date of such calculation) as if such Purchase had occurred
on the first day of such period, even if the Purchase has not yet been consummated as of the date of
determination;

(2) the Consolidated EBITDA (whether positive or negative) attributable to discontinued operations, as
determined in accordance with IFRS, and operations, businesses or group of assets constituting a business
or operating unit (and ownership interests therein) disposed of prior to the Applicable Test Date, will be
excluded on a pro forma basis as if such disposition occurred on the first day of the Relevant Period
(taking into account the full run rate effect of cost savings, operating expense reductions, restructuring
charges, operating improvements, expenses, synergies or similar initiatives that are reasonably anticipated
to be realized within the next 24 months following the date of such calculation, resulting from any such
disposal, as determined in good faith by a responsible accounting or financial officer of the Issuer);

(3) the Consolidated Interest Expense attributable to discontinued operations, as determined in accordance
with IFRS, and operations, businesses or group of assets constituting a business or operating unit (and
ownership interests therein) disposed of prior to the Applicable Test Date, will be excluded on a pro forma
basis as if such disposition occurred on the first day of the Relevant Period, but only to the extent that the
obligations giving rise to such Consolidated Interest Expense will not be obligations of the Issuer or any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries following the Applicable Test Date;

(4) any Person that is a Restricted Subsidiary on the Applicable Test Date will be deemed to have been a
Restricted Subsidiary at all times during the Relevant Period;

(5) any Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary on the Applicable Test Date will be deemed not to have
been a Restricted Subsidiary at any time during the Relevant Period; and

(6) if any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest, the interest expense on such Indebtedness will be
calculated as if the rate in effect on the Applicable Test Date had been the applicable rate for the Relevant
Period (taking into account any Interest Rate Agreement applicable to such Indebtedness), and if any
Indebtedness is not denominated in the Issuer’s functional currency, that Indebtedness for purposes of the
calculation of Consolidated Net Leverage shall be determined in accordance with IFRS.

For the purposes of this definition and the definitions of Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Net Income, calculations will be as determined
in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer (including in respect of the full run
rate effect of anticipated cost savings, operating expense reductions, restructuring charges, operating
improvements, expenses, synergies or similar initiatives that are reasonably anticipated to be realized within the
next 24 months following the date of such calculation) as though the full effect of such cost savings, operating
expense reductions, restructuring charges, operating improvements, expenses, synergies or similar initiatives
were realized on the first day of the Relevant Period and shall also include the reasonably anticipated full run
rate effect (as calculated in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer) of cost
savings, operating expense reductions, restructuring charges, operating improvements, expenses, synergies or
similar initiatives that have been or will be initiated by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries and are reasonably
anticipated to be realized within the next 24 months following the date of such calculation as though such cost
savings, operating expense reductions, restructuring charges, operating improvements, expenses, synergies or
similar initiatives had been fully implemented on the first day of the Relevant Period, provided that such
anticipated cost savings, operating expense reductions, restructuring charges, operating improvements, expenses,
synergies or similar initiatives are not duplicative of cost savings, operating expense reductions, restructuring
charges, operating improvements, expenses, synergies or similar initiatives already included in such calculation
for such period.

###### BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM

 General

Notes sold within the United States to “qualified institutional buyers” in reliance on Rule 144A will initially be
represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Rule 144A
**Global Notes”). On the Issue Date, the Rule 144A Global Note representing the Notes (the “Rule 144A Global**
**Note”) will be deposited with a common depository and registered in the name of the nominee of the common**
depository for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Notes sold outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be
represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation
**S Global Notes” and, together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). On the Issue Date, the**
Regulation S Global Note representing the Notes (the “Regulation S Global Note” and, together with the Rule
144A Global Note, the “Global Notes”) will be deposited with a common depositary and registered in the name
of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the “Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests”) and ownership
of interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the
Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts
with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that hold interests through such participants. Euroclear and
Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities
accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories. Except under the limited
circumstances described below, Book-Entry Interests will not be issued in definitive form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained
in book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The Book-Entry Interests in the Global
Notes will be issued only in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.
The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit a
participant’s account on their book-entry transfer and registration systems with the interest beneficially owned
by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require
that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of those securities in definitive form. The foregoing
limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes
are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not be considered the owners or “holders” of Notes for
any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary of Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or its
respective nominees), will be considered the sole holders of the Global Notes for all purposes under the
Indenture. In addition, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and indirect
participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and the participants through which they
own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders of Notes under the
Indenture.

None of the Issuer, the Guarantors or any of the Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the Paying Agent, the Registrar or
any of their respective agents will have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records relating to
the Book-Entry Interests.

281


-----

###### Definitive Registered Notes

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive Notes in registered
form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”) only in the following circumstances:

(i) if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as
depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days; or

(ii) the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear or
Clearstream following an “Event of Default” under the Indenture.

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest
described in the immediately preceding clause (ii), their current procedure is to request that the Issuer issue or
cause to be issued Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests and not only to the
owner who made the initial request.

In such an event, the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and
issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream or the Issuer, as
applicable (in accordance with its respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from
participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes
will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the Indenture, unless that legend is not required by the Indenture
or applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, any Transfer Agent and the Registrar
shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person
will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced through
registration from time to time at the registered office of the Issuer, and such registration is a means of evidencing
title to the Notes.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the Book-Entry
Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear
and/or Clearstream, as applicable.

The Issuer will not be required to register the transfer or exchange of Definitive Registered Notes for a period
of 15 calendar days preceding (i) the record date for any payment of interest on the Notes, (ii) any date fixed
for redemption of the Notes or (iii) the date fixed for selection of the Notes to be redeemed in part. The Issuer
is also not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Notes selected for redemption or which the holder
has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a change of control offer or asset sale offer.
In the event of the transfer of any Definitive Registered Note, the Trustee may require a holder, among other
things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents as described in the Indenture. The Issuer
may require a holder to pay any transfer taxes and fees required by law and permitted by the Indenture and the
Notes.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such a Definitive Registered Note has
been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Note is mutilated and is surrendered
to the Registrar or at the office of a transfer agent, the Issuer will issue and the Trustee (or an authentication
agent appointed by it) will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and the
Issuer’s requirements are met. The Issuer or the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a
Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both to protect
themselves, the Registrar or the Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which any of
them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. The Issuer, Registrar and Trustee may charge for
any expenses incurred by it in replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

282


-----

If any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to become
due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by the Issuer pursuant to the provisions of the
Indenture, the Issuer, in its discretion, may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or
purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged only after the transferor first delivers to the
Trustee a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply
with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

###### Redemption of the Global Notes

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount
received by them in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection
with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The
Issuer understands that, under the existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes
are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on
a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions), by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and
appropriate; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000 principal amount may be
redeemed in part.

###### Payments on Global Notes

The Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal,
premium, if any, interest and additional amounts, if any) to the Paying Agent, which will make payments to
Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, such payments will be credited to participants’ accounts in accordance
with their customary procedures. The Issuer expects that standing customer instructions and customary practices
will govern payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar
and any of their respective agents will treat the registered holders of the Global Notes (e.g., the common
depositary (or its respective nominee)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all
other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the
Registrar or any of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

- any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to,
or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the
records of Euroclear or Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments
made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

- any other matter relating to the actions and practices of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or
indirect participant (including payments made); or

- the records of the common depositary.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility of
such participant.

###### Currency of Payment for the Global Notes

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of Notes will be
paid to holders of interests in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in euro.

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any regulations of
the applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Initial Purchasers, the
Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or any of their respective agents will be liable to any holder of
a Global Note or any other person for any commissions, costs, losses or expenses in relation to or resulting from
any currency conversion or rounding effected in connection with any such payment. Holders may be subject to
foreign exchange risks that may have economic and tax consequences to them.

###### Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of a
Note (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described above) only at the direction of one or more
participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of
such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have
given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents,
waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default
under the relevant Notes, Euroclear and Clearstream, at the request of the holders of such Notes, reserve the
right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes, and to distribute such Definitive Registered
Notes to their participants.

###### Transfers

Transfers between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in accordance with Euroclear’s and
Clearstream’s rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder of a Note requires physical
delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes to persons in states that require
the physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder of Notes must transfer its
interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth under “Transfer Restrictions.” Book-Entry Interests
in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements discussed under
“Transfer Restrictions.”

Transfers of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A Book-Entry
Interests will at all times be subject to such transfer restrictions.

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Regulation
S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in
the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 or any
other exemption (if available under the Securities Act).

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Rule
144A Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided
in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes
is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements
of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions”
and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction.

284


-----

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the
Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only
as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only if the transferor
first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such
transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Transfer
_Restrictions.”_

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest
in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly
will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry
Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

###### Pledges

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect
participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a Book-Entry Interest to pledge such interest to persons
or entities who or that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in
respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some
jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently,
the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited.

###### Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable. We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience
of investors. The operations and procedures of the settlement system are controlled by the settlement system
and may be changed at any time. Neither the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the
Registrar nor any of the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those operations or procedures.

The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold
securities for participating organizations. They facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions
between their participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such participants. Euroclear
and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration,
clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream
interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such
as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect
access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust
companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant,
either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can act only on behalf of participants, who or that in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to
persons or entities who or that do not participate in the Euroclear and/or Clearstream system, or otherwise take
actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The
laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form.
Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of

28


-----

beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the
144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

###### Special Timing Considerations

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving the Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems are open
for business. In addition, because of time zone differences, there may be complications with completing
transactions involving Euroclear and/or Clearstream on the same business day as in the United States. United
States investors who or that wish to transfer their interests in the Notes, or to receive or make a payment or
delivery of Notes, on a particular day, may find that the transactions will not be performed until the next business
day in Brussels, if Euroclear is used, or in Luxembourg, if Clearstream is used.

###### Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of the Exchange.
Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in
the ordinary way in accordance with their respective system’s rules and operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers
of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, they are under no obligation to
perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any
time. None of the Issuer or any of the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the
Registrar or the Paying Agent will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or
their participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing
their operations.

###### Initial Settlement

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euros. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or
Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in registered form.
Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders
on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value of the settlement date.

###### Secondary Market Trading

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear and Clearstream and will settle in same
day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading
of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that
settlement can be made on the desired value date.

###### CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS

 U.S. Federal Income Taxation

The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and
disposition of Notes by a U.S. Holder (as defined below). This summary deals only with initial purchasers of
Notes at the “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of Notes is sold for money, excluding
sales to underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) in the initial offering that are U.S. Holders and that will
hold the Notes as capital assets. The discussion does not cover all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that
may be relevant to, or the actual tax effect that any of the matters described herein will have on, the acquisition,
ownership or disposition of Notes by particular investors (including consequences under any alternative
minimum tax, net investment income tax or special rules for the taxable year of inclusion for accrual basis
taxpayers under Section 451(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”)), and does not
address any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or
any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. This summary also does not discuss all of the tax considerations that may
be relevant to certain types of investors subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws
(such as financial institutions, insurance companies, individual retirement accounts and other tax-deferred
accounts, tax-exempt organizations, dealers in securities or currencies, investors that will hold the Notes as part
of straddles, hedging transactions or conversion transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes, persons that
have ceased to be U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents of the United States, investors holding the Notes
in connection with a trade or business conducted outside of the United States, U.S. citizens or lawful permanent
residents living abroad or investors whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar).

As used herein, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of Notes that is, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, (i) an individual citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation (or other entity treated as a
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized under the laws of the United States, any
state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income
tax without regard to its source or (iv) a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary
supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all
substantial decisions of the trust, or the trust has validly elected to be treated as a domestic trust for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

The U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S.
federal income tax purposes that holds Notes will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the
partnership. Prospective purchasers that are entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal
income tax purposes should consult their tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences to
them and their partners of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of Notes by the partnership.

This summary is based on the tax laws of the United States including the Code, its legislative history, existing
and proposed regulations thereunder, published rulings and court decisions, all as of the date hereof and all
subject to change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service (“IRS”) have been or are expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can
be no assurance that the IRS will not take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase,
ownership or disposition of the Notes or that any such position would not be sustained.

**THE SUMMARY OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES SET OUT BELOW IS FOR**

**AND EFFECT OF STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. AND OTHER TAX LAWS AND POSSIBLE CHANGES**
**IN TAX LAW.**

###### Payments of Stated Interest

 General

Payments of stated interest on a Note (without reduction for any amounts withheld and including payments of
any Additional Amounts) generally will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary income at the time it is received
or accrued, depending on such U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Prospective purchasers should consult their tax advisors concerning the applicability of the foreign tax credit
and source of income rules to income attributable to the Notes.

###### Foreign Currency Denominated Interest

The amount of income recognized by a cash basis U.S. Holder will be the U.S. dollar value of the Euro interest
payment, based on the spot rate of exchange in effect on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment
is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. A cash basis U.S. holder will not recognize foreign currency exchange
gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such stated interest, but may have exchange gain or loss attributable
to the actual disposition of the Euros so received.

An accrual basis U.S. Holder may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to an interest
payment denominated in Euros in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, the amount
of income accrued will be based on the average exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual period (or, in
the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. Holder, the part of the period within each
taxable year).

Under the second method, the U.S. Holder may elect to determine the amount of income accrued on the basis
of the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans
two taxable years, the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the part of the period within each taxable year).
Additionally, if a payment of interest is actually received within five business days of the last day of the accrual
period, an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder may instead translate the accrued interest into U.S. dollars at the
exchange rate in effect on the day of actual receipt. Any such election will apply to all debt instruments held by
the U.S. Holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by
the U.S. Holder, and will be irrevocable without the consent of the IRS.

Upon receipt of the interest payment (including a payment attributable to accrued but unpaid interest upon the
sale or retirement of a Note) denominated in foreign currency, the accrual basis U.S. Holder may recognize U.S.
source exchange gain or loss (taxable as U.S.-source ordinary income or loss) equal to the difference between
the amount received (translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date of receipt) and the amount
previously accrued, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars.

**_Original Issue Discount_**

The Notes may be issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such event, U.S. Holders generally
will be required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) on an annual basis under a constant
yield accrual method regardless of their regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As
a result, U.S. Holders will generally include any OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable
to such income.

The Notes will be treated as issued with OID if the stated principal amount of such Notes exceeds their issue
price (as defined above) by an amount equal to or more than a statutorily defined de minimis amount (generally,

288


-----

0.0025 multiplied by the stated principal amount and the number of complete years to maturity from the issue
date).

In the event that the Notes are issued with OID, the amount of OID with respect to a Note includible in income
by a U.S. Holder is the sum of the “daily portions” of OID with respect to the Note for each day during the
taxable year or portion thereof in which such U.S. Holder holds such Note. A daily portion is determined by
allocating to each day in any “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID that accrued in such period. The
accrual period of a Note may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the Note, provided that
each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either
on the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID that accrues with respect to any accrual period
is the excess of (i) the product of the Note’s “adjusted issue price” at the beginning of such accrual period and
its “yield to maturity,” determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly
adjusted for the length of such period, over (ii) the amount of stated interest allocable to such accrual period.
The adjusted issue price of a Note at the start of any accrual period generally is equal to its issue price, increased
by the OID includible in income for each prior accrual period. The yield to maturity of a Note is the discount
rate that, when used in computing the present value of all principal and interest payments to be made under the
Note, produces an amount equal to the issue price of the Note. Solely for purposes of determining OID accruals
and adjusted issue price with respect to the Notes, the amounts of stated interest and OID are determined by
assuming that the interest rate on the Notes is a fixed rate based on the value of the floating rate applicable to
the Notes as of the issue date.

OID generally will be income from sources outside the United States and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax
credit, generally will be considered passive category income.

OID, if any, on the Notes will be determined for any accrual period in foreign currency and then translated into
U.S. dollars in accordance with either of the two alternative methods described above under “—Foreign
_Currency Denominated Interest.”_

A U.S. Holder will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon the
disposition of a Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously included in
income) to the extent of the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency payment
received, determined based on the spot rate on the date such payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of
the accrued OID, as determined in the manner described above. For these purposes, all payments on a Note
other than stated interest will be viewed first, as payments of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof),
with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first; and second, as payments of principal.
Exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as U.S. source ordinary income or loss and not as an adjustment
to interest income or expense.

**_IPO Pushdown_**

The terms of the Notes provide that, in certain circumstances, the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes may
be assumed by a subsidiary of the Issuer (see “Description of the Notes – IPO Pushdown”). Any such
assumption might be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a deemed disposition of Notes by a U.S.
Holder in exchange for “new notes” issued by the IPO Pushdown Entity. As a result of this deemed exchange,
a U.S. Holder could be required to recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to
the difference, if any, between the issue price of the “new notes” (as determined for U.S. federal income tax
purposes), and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Notes (although any such loss could be disallowed).
A U.S. Holder would also have a new holding period and new tax basis in the “new notes” for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. In addition, if the fair market value of the “new notes” at the time of the IPO Pushdown
was less than the principal amount of the “new notes” (by more than a statutorily defined de minimis amount),
such “new notes” may be treated as issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes, even where the

289


-----

original Notes were not issued with OID. In such case, a U.S. Holder would be required to include such OID in
gross income in the manner discussed above under “—Original Issue Discount.” To the extent that the IPO
Pushdown Entity acquires substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and the transaction does not result in a
change in payment expectations or a significant alteration, such assumption generally should not be treated as
a deemed exchange of the Notes for “new notes”. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors concerning the
U.S. federal income tax consequences to them of a change in obligor with respect to the Notes.

###### Sale, Exchange, Redemption, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes

A U.S. Holder generally will recognize gain or loss on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other
taxable disposition of a Note equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale, exchange,
redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis of the Note, in each
case as determined in U.S. dollars. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note generally will be its U.S. dollar
cost of such Note to such U.S. Holder increased by any OID previously included in income by such U.S. Holder
with respect to the Note. The amount realized does not include the amount attributable to accrued but unpaid
interest, which will be taxable as interest income (as discussed above under “—Payments of Stated Interest”)
to the extent not previously included in income. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors about how
to account for proceeds received on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of
Notes that are not paid in U.S. dollars.

A U.S. Holder will recognize U.S. source exchange rate gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) on
the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note equal to the difference, if any,
between the U.S. dollar values of the U.S. Holder’s purchase price for the Note (i) on the date of sale, exchange,
redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition and (ii) the date on which the U.S. Holder acquired the Note.
In addition, upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder
may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated
interest and accrued OID (if any), which will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of Stated
_Interest” or “—Original Issue Discount”, as applicable. Any such exchange rate gain or loss (including any_
exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of accrued but unpaid interest and accrued OID) will be realized
only to the extent of total gain or loss realized on such disposition.

Except to the extent of changes in exchange rates, gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on the sale or
retirement of a Note will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the Note was held
by the U.S. Holder for more than one year. Non-corporate U.S. Holders generally are subject to tax on longterm capital gains at reduced rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

Gain or loss realized by a U.S. Holder on the sale or retirement of a Note generally will be U.S. source.
Prospective purchasers should consult their tax advisors as to the foreign tax credit implications of the sale or
retirement of Notes.

###### Backup Withholding and Information Reporting

Payments of principal and interest on the Notes, and the proceeds of a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement
or other taxable disposition of Notes, by a U.S. paying agent or other U.S. intermediary will be reported to the
IRS and to the U.S. Holder as may be required under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations. Backup withholding
may apply to these payments if the U.S. Holder fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number or
certification of exempt status or fails to comply with applicable certification requirements. Certain U.S. Holders

290


-----

are not subject to backup withholding. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors as to their qualification
for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining an exemption.

###### Reportable Transactions

A U.S. taxpayer that participates in a "reportable transaction" will be required to disclose its participation to the
IRS. Under the relevant rules, if the Notes are denominated in a foreign currency, a U.S. Holder may be required
to treat a foreign currency exchange loss from the Notes as a reportable transaction if this loss exceeds the
relevant threshold in the regulations (U.S.$50,000 in a single taxable year, if the U.S. Holder is an individual
or trust, or higher amounts for other non-individual U.S. Holders), and to disclose its investment by filing Form
8886 with the IRS. A penalty in the amount of U.S.$10,000 in the case of a natural person and U.S.$50,000 in
all other cases generally is imposed on any taxpayer that fails to timely file an information return with the IRS
with respect to a transaction resulting in a loss that is treated as a reportable transaction. Prospective purchasers
are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing disclosure requirements to their
ownership of the Notes and any other reporting obligations that may apply to the ownership or disposition of
Notes, including requirements related to the holding of certain specified foreign financial assets and the
significant penalties that may result from non-compliance with any of these disclosure or reporting obligations.

###### Certain Swedish tax considerations

The following summary of certain tax considerations that may arise as a result of holding Notes is based on
current Swedish tax legislation and is intended only as general information for holders of Notes who are resident
in Sweden for tax purposes, unless otherwise indicated. This description does not deal comprehensively with
all tax consequences that may occur for holders of Notes and is neither intended to be nor should be construed
as legal or tax advice. For instance, it does not cover the specific rules where Notes are held by a partnership or
as current assets in a business operation. Moreover, the description does not address situations where Notes are
held in an investment savings account (Sw. investeringssparkonto) or through an endowment insurance (Sw.
_kapitalförsäkring). The summary does not address the rules regarding reporting obligations for, among others,_
payers of interest. Special tax consequences that are not described below may also apply for certain categories
of taxpayers, including investment companies and mutual funds. Prospective purchasers of Notes should consult
their own tax advisers for information with respect to the special tax consequences that may arise as a result of
acquiring, holding and disposing of Notes, including the applicability and effect of foreign income tax rules,
provisions in double taxation treaties and other rules which may be applicable.

###### Taxation of individuals tax resident in Sweden

_Capital gains and losses. Individuals who sell their Notes, or have their Notes redeemed or bought back, are_
subject to capital gains tax. The tax rate is 30 per cent.

The capital gain or loss is calculated as the difference between the sales (or redemption) proceeds, after
deduction of sales costs, and the Notes’ acquisition cost for tax purposes. The acquisition cost is determined
according to the “average method”. This means that the acquisition value for all Notes of the same class and
type shall be added together and computed collectively, with respect to changes to the holding.

Gains or losses on currency exchange rate fluctuations may arise in relation to Notes where the sales proceeds
received are in a foreign currency. However, no special calculations are required if the sales proceeds are
exchanged into SEK within 30 days from the time of disposal. In such case, the exchange rate on the date of

291


-----

exchange shall be used when calculating the value of the sales proceeds. The exchange rate on the date of
acquisition is generally used when determining the acquisition cost for tax purposes.

As a general rule, 70 per cent. of a capital loss is deductible against any other taxable income from capital.
However, capital losses on listed Swedish receivables are fully deductible in the income from capital category.
According to Swedish case law, full deductibility also applies to capital losses on listed foreign receivables.

If a net loss arises in the income from capital category, a reduction of the tax on income from employment and
from business operations, as well as the tax on real estate and the municipal real estate fee, is allowed. The tax
reduction is 30 per cent. of any part of the net loss not exceeding SEK 100,000 and 21 per cent. of any part of
the net loss in excess of SEK 100,000. An excess net loss may not be carried forward to a subsequent fiscal
year.

_Interest. Any interest income received by an individual Noteholder is subject to Swedish tax at a tax rate of 30_
per cent. in the income from capital category. Interest income is taxable when the income can be disposed of.

_Withholding of tax on interest. The legal entity effecting an interest payment to an individual (or an estate of a_
deceased individual) will normally be required to withhold Swedish preliminary tax (Sw. preliminärskatt). The
preliminary tax withheld is normally equal to the final tax on the interest income, which means that there is
generally no further tax payable on the interest.

###### Taxation of Swedish limited liability companies

For limited liability companies (Sw. aktiebolag), all income, including interest and capital gains on the Notes,
is taxed as income from business operations at a flat rate of 20.6 per cent. Deductible capital losses on the Notes
may normally be fully off-set against income from business operations.

Interest income and currency exchange fluctuations are normally taxable, or deductible, as the case may be, on
an accrual basis.

Specific rules may apply to Notes held as a hedge for foreign currency exposure.

###### Taxation of holders of Notes that are not tax resident in Sweden

Payments of any principal amount or any amount that is considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes to
a Noteholder are not subject to Swedish income tax, provided that such a holder is not resident in Sweden for
Swedish tax purposes and provided that such a holder does not have a permanent establishment in Sweden to
which the Notes are effectively connected.

Swedish withholding tax, or Swedish tax deduction, is not imposed on payments of any principal amount or
any amount that is considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes to a non-resident holder of Notes.

Holders of Notes who are not resident in Sweden for Swedish tax purposes and who are not carrying on business
operations from a permanent establishment in Sweden to which the Notes are attributable are generally not
liable for Swedish capital gains taxation on the disposal of Notes. The holders of Notes may be subject to tax
in their country of residence.

###### PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION

The Issuer, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, J.P. Morgan SE, Nordea Bank Abp, Danske Bank A/S, DNB
Bank ASA, Sweden Branch, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (publ) and Swedbank AB (publ), as Initial
Purchasers, have entered into a purchase agreement dated on or around the date of this offering memorandum
with respect to the Notes (the “Purchase Agreement”).

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the Issuer has agreed to sell to the
Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase from the Issuer, the entire principal amount
of the Notes.

The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to purchase
Notes from the Issuer, are several and not joint.

The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the issue price that appears on the cover
of this offering memorandum for the Notes. After the initial Offering, the Initial Purchasers may change the
Offering’s price for the Notes and any other selling terms without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and
sell Notes in the United States through certain of their affiliates or through United States registered broker
dealers. In the Purchase Agreement, we have agreed that:

- the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the relevant Notes are subject
to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain opinions by their counsel;

- during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including the date that is 90 days
after such date, none of the Issuer, the Guarantors or any of their subsidiaries or other affiliates will offer,
sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt (including, without limitation, any debt securities,
loans or other debt instruments), issued or guaranteed by any of the Issuer or the Guarantors and having
a tenor of more than one year (other than the Notes); and

- the Issuer and the relevant Guarantors will indemnify the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates
against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and/or will contribute to payments
that the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may be required to make in respect of those
liabilities.

- the Issuer has agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for their services in connection
with the Offering and to reimburse them for certain out-of-pocket expenses. Persons who purchase Notes
from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in accordance
with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the issue price set forth on the cover
page hereof. Certain affiliates of the Issuer may purchase a portion of the Notes in the Offering.

Nordea Bank Abp (“Nordea”) is not registered as a U.S. broker-dealer and consequently will not effect any
offers or sales of any Notes in the United States unless intermediated by Nordea Securities LLC, an affiliated
U.S. registered broker-dealer. Nordea’s activities in United States will be effected only to the extent permitted
by Rule 15a-6 under the Exchange Act.

Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (publ) (“SEB”) is not a U.S. registered broker-dealer and therefore, intends
to participate in the offering outside of the United States and, to the extent that the offering by SEB is in the
United States, it will offer to and place securities with investors through SEB Securities, Inc., an affiliated U.S.
broker-dealer. The activities of SEB in the United States will be effected only to the extent permitted by Rule
15a-6 under the Exchange Act.

DNB Bank ASA, Sweden Branch (“DNB”) is not registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
as a U.S. registered broker-dealer and does not intend to participate in any offer of sale of the Bonds of the

293


-----

within the United States but, to the extent that the offering by DNB is in the United States, DNB will offer to
and place securities with investors through DNB Markets, Inc., an affiliated U.S. broker-dealer.

Swedbank AB (publ) (“Swedbank”) is not an U.S. registered broker-dealer and accordingly Swedbank will
only effect offers and sales of the Notes solely outside of the United States in accordance with Regulation S.

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other
jurisdiction. In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has agreed that the Notes may not be offered or
sold within the United States except pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act or in transactions not subject to those registration requirements, including sales pursuant to Rule
144A and Regulation S.

In addition, until 40 days following the later of (i) the commencement of the Offering and (ii) the Issue Date,
an offer or sale of Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering) may
violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act unless the dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance
with Rule 144A or another exemption from registration under the Securities Act. During this 40-day period,
neither Clearstream nor Euroclear will monitor compliance by dealers with the Securities Act.

The Notes are a new issue of securities, and there is currently no established trading market for the Notes. In
addition, the Notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Transfer
_Restrictions.” We do not intend to apply for the Notes to be listed on any securities exchange other than the_
Official List of the Exchange or to arrange for the Notes to be quoted on any quotation system. The Initial
Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes, but they are not obligated to do so.
The Initial Purchasers may discontinue any market making in the Notes at any time in their sole discretion. In
addition, such market making activities will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act and other applicable legal requirements. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid trading market
will develop for the Notes, that you will be able to sell your Notes at a particular time or that the prices that you
receive when you sell will be favorable.

In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers may engage in overallotment, stabilizing transactions
and syndicate covering transactions. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the Offering size, which creates
a short position for the Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the Notes in the open
market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. Syndicate covering transactions
involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover
short positions. Stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions may cause the price of the Notes
to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of those transactions. If the Initial Purchasers engage in
stabilizing or syndicate covering transactions, they may discontinue them at any time.

It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the date specified
on the cover page of this offering memorandum, which will be the business day following the date of
pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+  ”). Under Rule 15(c)6-1 of the
Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the
parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the
date of pricing or the next successive business day will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially
will settle in T+   , to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed
settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing should consult their own
advisor.

In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser, severally and not jointly, has represented and agreed that:

- it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything
done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom; and

294


-----

- it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of
Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances
in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or the Guarantors.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by the Issuer
or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or
distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction
where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or
indirectly, and neither this offering memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in
connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in
compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This offering
memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction
where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum
comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the
distribution of this offering memorandum and resale of Notes. See “Notice to Certain Investors.”

Certain of the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates from time to time have performed, and in the future will
perform, banking, investment banking, advisory, consulting and other financial services for the Issuer and its
affiliates, for which they may receive customary advisory and transaction fees and reimbursement of expenses.
Each Initial Purchaser is also involved in the Super Senior Facilities. In addition, in the ordinary course of their
business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and
actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including
bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities
activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or
their affiliates that have a lending relationship with us routinely hedge their credit exposure to us consistent
with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would
hedge such exposure by entering into transactions that consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or
the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such short
positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchasers and
their affiliates may also make investment recommendations or publish or express independent research views
in respect of the Issuer, the Group, such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to
clients that they acquire, long or short positions in such securities and instruments.

###### CERTAIN INSOLVENCY CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS

Set forth below is a summary of certain limitations on the enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the security
interests in some of the jurisdictions in which the Note Guarantees or the Collateral are being provided. It is a
summary only, and proceedings of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event could be initiated in any of these
jurisdictions and in the jurisdiction of organization of a future guarantor of the Notes. The application of these
various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply and
could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights and collect payment in full under the Notes, the Note
Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral. Also set forth below is a brief description of certain
aspects of insolvency law in Sweden, Norway and Finland.

###### European Union

The Guarantors in Sweden, Norway and Finland are organized under the European Economic Area.

Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on insolvency
proceedings (recast), as amended, in particular by Regulation (EU) 2018/946 of the European Parliament and
of the Council of 4 July 2018, published in the Official Gazette of the European Union on July 6, 2018 (the
“EU Insolvency Regulation”), was published in the Official Gazette of the European Union on June 5, 2015.

The EU Insolvency Regulation applies within the European Union (other than Denmark), to public collective
insolvency proceedings as defined therein and listed in its Annex A. It provides that the courts of the Member
State in which a debtor’s “center of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency
Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to commence main insolvency proceedings relating to such debtor. The
determination of where a debtor has its center of main interests is a question of fact on which the courts of the
different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views.

Pursuant to Article 4 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, a court requested to open insolvency proceedings is
required to examine whether it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 3 and, pursuant to Article 5, such decision
may be challenged by the debtor or any creditor on grounds of international jurisdiction.

Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation provides that the center of main interests, or “COMI” of a “debtor
shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is
ascertainable by third parties”. It sets forth, as explained by Recital (30), a rebuttable presumption that a debtor
has its COMI in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary.
This presumption shall only apply if the registered office of the legal person has not been moved to another
Member State within the 3-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Recital
(30) provides that it should be possible to rebut this presumption if a debtor’s central administration is located
in a Member State other than that of its registered office and a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant
factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the debtor’s actual center of
management and supervision and the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. Under
the previous EU insolvency regulation (Council Regulation (EC) 1346/2000 of 29 May 2000), which defined
the COMI in similar terms, the courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in determining a
debtor’s COMI, including in particular where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts
the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors
are established. A debtor’s COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is determined
for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings at
the time of the filing of the insolvency petition.

296


-----

If a debtor’s COMI is and will remain located in the Member State (other than Denmark) in which it has its
registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the EU Insolvency Regulation
would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to
commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation.
Insolvency proceedings commenced in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be
recognized in the other EU Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be
commenced in another Member State.

If a debtor’s COMI is in a Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency
Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to commence secondary
(territorial) insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if such debtor has an “establishment” (within the
meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member
State or had an establishment in such EU Member State in the 3-month period prior to the request for
commencement of main insolvency proceedings. An “establishment” is defined to mean “any place of
operations where the debtor carries out or has carried out in the 3-month period prior to the request to commence
main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets”.

Where main proceedings have been commenced in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI, any
proceedings commenced subsequently in another Member State in which the debtor has an establishment shall
be secondary insolvency proceedings. The effects of such proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor
situated in the territory of such other Member State. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the
debtor has its COMI have not yet been commenced, pursuant to Article 3 (4) of the EU Insolvency Regulation,
secondary insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State where the debtor has an
establishment where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the
debtor’s COMI is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the secondary insolvency proceedings are
commenced at the request of (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an
establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is
requested or (ii) a public authority that has the right to make such a request under the law of the Member State
in which the establishment is located. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary
insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex for
concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency
proceedings of the debtor. Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of
the Member State within the territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with
its Article 3 shall have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is
closely linked with them, such as avoidance actions. The opening of insolvency proceedings in a Member State
pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation shall not affect the rights in rem of creditors or third parties in respect
of tangible or intangible, moveable or immoveable assets, both specific assets and collections of indefinite
assets as a whole that change from time to time, belonging to the debtor that are situated within the territory of
another Member State at the time of the opening of proceedings. Rights in rem include:

a) the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the proceeds of
or income from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a mortgage;

b) the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in respect of the claim
or by assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee;

c) the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or use of
them contrary to the wishes of the party so entitled;

d) a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets.

29


-----

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court commencing
main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary
proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in a Member State
that has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s COMI is located there) may exercise
the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets
of the debtor from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations, as long as no insolvency proceedings
have been commenced in that other Member State or no preservation measures have been taken to the contrary
further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has
assets.

Pursuant to Article 21 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner appointed by the court of
the main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of the Member State in which the
main proceedings are located in another Member State as long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened
in such other Member State or any preservation measure to the contrary has been taken there further to a request
to open insolvency proceedings in such other Member State. He may, in particular, subject to the preservation
of third parties’ right in rem pursuant to Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation and to the preservation of
the sellers’ rights based on a reservation of title pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, remove
assets of the company from that other Member State.

However, under Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency
proceedings may attempt to avoid the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State
by 243 giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which secondary
insolvency proceedings could be opened that the distribution of those assets or of the proceeds received as a
result of their realization, will comply with the distribution and priority rights that would apply under the
relevant national law if secondary insolvency proceedings were opened in such other Member State. Such
undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by known local creditors. The rules on qualified
majority and voting that apply to the adoption of restructuring plans under the laws of the Member State shall
also apply to the approval of the undertaking. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate
and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it shall, at the request of the insolvency
practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceedings if it is satisfied that the
undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors.

Additionally, under Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual
enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and its
creditors, the court, at the request of the company or of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency
proceedings, may stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding three
months, provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local creditors.

Under Article 46 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court that opened the secondary insolvency proceedings
will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part upon receipt of a request from the insolvency
practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a period of up to three months, unless such a request is
manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency proceedings. Such stay may be continued or
renewed for similar periods. Where the court stays the process of realization of the assets, the court may require
the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the
interests of the creditors in the secondary insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors.

The EU Insolvency Regulation provides:

a) for cooperation and communication between insolvency practitioners of the main insolvency
proceedings and of the secondary insolvency proceedings and, in order to facilitate the coordination

298


-----

of main, territorial and secondary insolvency proceedings concerning the same debtor for cooperation
and communication between (i) courts and (ii)insolvency practitioners and courts;

b) for specific cooperation, communication and coordination measures in order to ensure the efficient
administration of insolvency proceedings relating to different companies forming part of the same
group;

c) that the Member States shall establish and maintain a register of insolvency proceedings; and,

d) that the European Commission shall establish a decentralized system for the interconnection of the
insolvency registers referred to under (b).

The United Kingdom ceased to be a member of the EU on January 31, 2020, 11.00 p.m. (“exit day”) and has
now entered its transition period. The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended by the European
Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020) provides that direct EU legislation (which term includes any EU
regulation as it has effect in EU law immediately before exit day (subject to certain exceptions)) shall form a
part of domestic law on and after exit day until the end of the transition period. In addition, whilst direct EU
legislation may continue to form a part of domestic law, it may be subject to a number of amendments. The
Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/146) sets out a number of amendments to be
made to the Recast Regulation. However, there remains considerable uncertainty regarding the final terms of
the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU, and related regulatory changes.

**_EU Directive on preventive restructuring frameworks_**

The EU Directive 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and the Council of 20 June 2019 on preventive
restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency
of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU)
2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency) (the “EU Restructuring Directive”) was published on
June 26, 2019.

The objectives of the EU Restructuring Directive are to ensure that (i) viable enterprises and entrepreneurs that
are in financial difficulties have access to effective national preventive restructuring frameworks that enable
them 244 to continue operating, (ii) honest insolvent or over-indebted entrepreneurs (i.e. individuals) can
benefit from a full discharge of debt after a reasonable period of time, thereby affording them a second chance
and (iii) the effectiveness of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt is improved,
in particular with a view to shortening their length.

The Restructuring Directive aims to achieve a higher degree of harmonization in the field of restructuring,
insolvency, discharge of debt and disqualifications by establishing substantive minimum standards for
preventive restructuring procedures as well as for procedures leading to a discharge of debt for entrepreneurs
in order to promote a culture that encourages early preventive restructuring to address financial difficulties at
an early stage, when it appears likely that insolvency can be prevented and the viability of the business can be
ensured. Most notably, the Restructuring Directive provides for a framework pursuant to which (a) a stay of
individual enforcement actions by creditors against debtors must be introduced by Member States national
legislation, (b) all creditor claims shall be grouped into separate classes each of which shall reflect a
commonality of interests (at a minimum, creditors of secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in separate
classes), (c) creditor claims may be restructured in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not
more than 75% of (i) the amount of the claims in each class and, (ii) where the Member State so requires, the
number of affected parties in each class and (d) a cross-class cram-down is introduced whereby a restructuring
plan may, under certain conditions, be adopted and bind dissenting creditors even if the creditors of one or more
classes do not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority. The transposition of the Restructuring

299


-----

Directive into national legislation shall protect new financing and interim financing and may also provide
priority ranking to new or interim financing granted in the context of the restructuring.

The EU Restructuring Directive shall be transposed into national laws or regulations by Member States by July
17, 2021 (with the exception of the provisions relating to the use of electronic means of communication for
which the time period for the transposition expires in certain respects on July 17, 2024, or, in others, on July
17, 2026), subject to a maximum 1 year extension of the transposition period for Member States encountering
particular difficulties in implementing the EU Restructuring Directive.

###### Sweden

 Applicable Insolvency Law

Certain Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Sweden (each a “Swedish Obligor”). To the extent that
such companies have their center-of-main interests in Sweden, Swedish bankruptcy law is applicable, subject
to the provisions of the EU-Insolvency Regulation. As a starting point and by virtue of Article 4 of the EU
Insolvency Regulation, insolvency proceedings applicable to a Swedish Obligor may be governed by Swedish
insolvency law (lex fori concursus).

###### Insolvency Proceedings

Pursuant to chapter 1, section 2 of the Swedish Bankruptcy Act (Sw. konkurslagen (1987:672)), if a company
is unable to pay its debts when due and such inability is not merely temporary, it is deemed insolvent and can
be declared bankrupt following a bankruptcy petition filed with the court by (i) the debtor or (ii) by a creditor
of the debtor.

In the event of bankruptcy, the court will appoint a receiver (Sw. konkursförvaltare) in bankruptcy who will
work in the interest of all creditors with the objective of realizing the debtor’s assets and distribute the proceeds
among the creditors.

The purpose of bankruptcy proceedings is to wind up the company in such a way that the company’s creditors
receive as high a proportion of their claims as possible. The receiver in bankruptcy is required to safeguard the
assets and can decide to continue the business or to close it down, depending on what is best for all creditors.
In general, the receiver in bankruptcy is required to sell the assets of the debtor as soon as possible and to
distribute the proceeds. In the interim, the receiver will take over the management and control of the company
and the company’s directors and/or managing director will no longer be entitled to represent the company or
dispose of the company’s assets.

When distributing the proceeds, the receiver must follow the mandatory provisions of the Swedish Rights of
Priority Act (Sw. förmånsrättslagen (1970:979)), as amended from time to time, that states the order in which
creditors have a right to be paid. As a general principle, in bankruptcy proceedings competing claims have equal
right to payment in relation to the size of the amount claimed from the debtor’s assets.

In case of enforcement outside of bankruptcy proceedings in respect of certain types of assets, such as over
shares, receivables, bank accounts, trademarks and contractual rights, enforcement can be carried out by the
security holder itself. A provision granting the secured party or its agent such right of enforcement is typically
included in any pledge agreement between the pledgor and the secured party or its agent. The secured party is
typically entitled to enforce the security through a sale of the collateral. However, certain restrictions apply to
the procedure for such a sale. In general, when enforcing the security, the secured party is under a duty of care
in relation to the security provider and the security granted. The security provider should, if the circumstances
are not exceptional, be given prior notice of the contemplated enforcement and also of the time and location of
the sale. Furthermore, sufficient notice should be given to prospective purchasers in order to create reasonable
preconditions for a market price being obtained in the sale. Where the secured party has been granted the right

300


-----

to enforce the security through a private sale, such sale must be made to a party unaffiliated with the secured
party unless the market price of the security can be independently and objectively established and the security
is sold at such price. Pledges over receivables and other claims are, if the receivable or claim has fallen due,
normally enforced through the secured party collecting the payment as opposed to selling the receivable.

Enforcement of security in bankruptcy is also subject to certain restrictions. A secured party holding a
possessory pledge over movable property (such as shares) may arrange for the sale of the movable property at
a public auction. Such secured party must however give the receiver in bankruptcy an opportunity to arrange
payment of the debtor’s debt to the creditor in order to redeem the movable property to the bankruptcy estate,
and the movable property may not, without the consent of the receiver in bankruptcy, be sold earlier than four
weeks after the estate inventory meeting (Sw. bouppteckningssammanträde) held as a part of the bankruptcy
proceedings. However, financial instruments, currency and, under certain circumstances, gold, are exempt from
this requirement. The secured party may either sell such financial instruments, currency or gold immediately or
assume ownership (against reduction of the secured debt with the market value of such assets or, if the market
value of the assets exceeds the outstanding debt, against repayment to the debtor of the surplus), provided that
the realization is done in a commercially viable manner. Should the security granted consist of rights over
unlisted shares in a subsidiary of the debtor, the receiver in bankruptcy must still be given an opportunity to
redeem the shares prior to the sale or deduction.

###### Priority of Certain Creditors

In general, proceeds are distributed in the following order:

(a) fees to the receiver;

(b) debts of the estate (Sw. massaskuld);

(c) specific preferential rights;

(d) general preferential rights;

(e) non-prioritized debts; and

(f) subordinated debts.

Fixed charges (in specified assets) are generally prioritized in order of establishment and fixed charges are
generally prioritized to floating charges. Debts with the same priority will be paid in relation to relative size.

###### Limitations on the Value of a Guarantee

A Swedish limited liability company may not provide a guarantee for the obligations of a parent or sister
company, unless they belong to the same group of companies and the Parent of that group is domiciled within
the European Economic Area (EEA). Furthermore, if a Swedish limited liability company provides any
guarantee without receiving sufficient corporate benefit in return, such guarantee will, in whole or in part, be
considered a distribution of assets, which will be lawful only to the extent (i) there is sufficient coverage for the
unrestricted equity capital of the Swedish limited liability company after the distribution (in other words, at the
time the guarantee is provided) (where the aggregate amount available for distribution during the period from
the annual general meeting until the following year’s annual general meeting shall be calculated on the basis of
the balance sheet approved by the shareholders at the first annual general meeting, taking into account changes
in the restricted equity capital after such annual general meeting) and (ii) if it is considered prudent by a Swedish
Obligor to undertake the value transfer after having taken into consideration the equity requirements imposed
by the nature, scope and risks relating to its business or such Swedish Obligor’s need to strengthen its balance
sheet, liquidity or financial position. Where the Swedish limited liability company is a parent company, the
latter assessment is also made on a group level. It should also be noted that laws relating to financial assistance

301


-----

in Sweden prohibit limited liability companies incorporated in Sweden from providing guarantees or other
credit support for obligations of any person where such obligations are being incurred for the purpose of
acquiring shares in the company itself or any of its group companies (with the exception of its subsidiaries) or
refinancing shareholder loans in connection therewith. The guarantees of and security interests granted by a
Swedish Obligor are limited in accordance with the above restrictions relating to corporate benefit and are
subject to limitation language limiting the liability of such entities thereunder if required by the above
restrictions relating to financial assistance and in accordance with the above restrictions relating to corporate
benefit.

###### Limitations on the Validity of Certain Transactions

In bankruptcy and company reorganization proceedings, transactions can (in certain circumstances and subject
to a time limit) be reversed and the goods or money can then be returned to the bankruptcy estate or the company
subject to company reorganization. Broadly, these transactions include, among others, situations where the
debtor has conveyed property fraudulently or preferentially to one creditor to the detriment of its other creditors
before the initiation of the relevant insolvency proceedings, granting a Guarantee that was either not stipulated
at the time when the obligation arose or not perfected without delay after such time and the delay is not
considered to be ordinary, or paid a debt that is not due or that is considerable compared to the value of the
debtor’s assets or if the payment is made by using unusual means of payment. In the majority of situations, a
claim for recovery can be made concerning actions that were made during the three months preceding the
commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. In certain situations, longer time limits apply and in
others there are no time limits. These include, among others, situations where the other party to an agreement
or other arrangement is deemed to be a closely related party to the debtor such as a subsidiary or Parent.

###### Limitations on Enforceability due to the Swedish Reorganization Act

The Swedish Reorganization Act (Sw. lagen (2022:964) om företagsrekonstruktion) provides companies facing
difficulties in meeting their payment obligations with an opportunity to resolve these without being declared
bankrupt. A petition for company reorganization may be presented by (i) the debtor or (ii) a creditor of the
debtor. A petition for company reorganization submitted by a creditor may be granted only where the debtor
has consented to the petition. Corporate reorganization proceedings shall, as a main rule, terminate within three
months from commencement. The company may request an extension for three months at a time. A corporate
reorganization may not, however, proceed for an aggregate period exceeding twelve months, unless the court
has ordered plan negotiation prior thereto. In such case, the corporate reorganization shall terminate not later
than fifteen months after the order regarding corporate reorganization.

An administrator (Sw. rekonstruktör) is appointed by the court and supervises the day-to-day activities and
safeguards the interests of creditors as well as the debtor. However, the debtor remains in full possession of the
business except that, for important decisions such as paying a debt that has fallen due prior to the order of
reorganization, granting security for a debt that arose prior to the order, undertaking new obligations or
transferring, pledging or granting rights in respect of assets of a substantial value for the business, the consent
of the administrator is required. The absence of such consent can affect the validity of the transaction and the
administrator may request that the transaction be reversed.

Upon the opening of corporate reorganization proceedings, the administrator must notify the creditors of the
reorganization proceedings. A creditors’ meeting will be held at which the creditors will be given the opportunity
to express their opinions as to whether the reorganization should continue. Upon the request of any of the
creditors, the court shall appoint a creditors’ committee composed of a maximum of three persons. However,
where special cause exists, the court may appoint additional persons to serve on the creditors’ committee. The
administrator shall, if possible, consult with the creditors’ committee prior to taking any important decisions.

302


-----

The making of an order under the Swedish Reorganization Act does not have the effect of terminating contracts
with the debtor (other than long-term contracts which the debtor may terminate with the consent of the
administrator) and, during the reorganization procedure, the debtor’s business activities continue in the ordinary
course of business. However, the procedure includes a suspension of payments to creditors and the debtor cannot
pay a debt that fell due prior to the order without the consent of the administrator and such consent may only
be granted should there be exceptional reasons for doing so and any petition for bankruptcy in respect of the
debtor will be stayed. The debtor may decide that a contract entered into prior to the order shall be performed
with the consent of the administrator (however, the consent of the administrator is not required where the
contract is in the course of the day-to-day management of the business). Where the contract relates to ongoing
or divisible obligations, the debtor may under certain circumstances decide that the contract shall be performed
only for a certain period of time or only for a number of the obligations that remain to be performed. A
moratorium also applies to execution in respect of a claim or enforcement of security during corporate
reorganization proceedings. However, execution may take place in respect of a claim for which the creditor
holds a chattel mortgage or right or retention (which is the case with a Swedish law pledge over the shares in a
Swedish limited liability company where the share certificates of such company has been delivered to the agent)
with the consent of the administrator, where it is unlikely that the company restructuring will thereby be
jeopardized or where the impact on the creditor would otherwise be unreasonably burdensome. The absence of
such consent from the administrator affects the validity of the transaction.

The debtor may request that the court order negotiation regarding a restructuring plan (Sw. rekonstruktionsplan)
which contains the measures that are necessary to successfully address the debtor’s financial difficulties and to
ensure that the business can be continued, in whole or in part, by the debtor or by a third party. The administrator
may request that the court order plan negotiation where the debtor’s request for plan negotiations does not lead
to a restructuring plan being confirmed. The affected parties are divided into one or more classes based on their
position or interest (classes include, among others, creditors with specific preferential rights, non-prioritized
debts, subordinated debt and shareholders and other parties who have an ownership interest in the debtor or the
debtor’s business) whereby the restructuring plan is adopted by a vote and confirmed by the court, after which
the plan becomes binding on the debtor and the other parties concerned. The adoption of a restructuring plan
requires at least two-third majority within each class in respect of the number of voters and the amounts of
claims or rights. However, the court shall nevertheless confirm a restructuring plan under certain circumstances
even if it has not been approved by all classes (such as an inter-class cramdown whereby more than half of the
classes have approved the restructuring plan and at least one of these classes is comprised of creditors with
preferential rights and at least two of the classes who approved the restructuring plan is comprised of creditors
who can be expected to receive payment in the event of the debtor’s bankruptcy).

###### Effect of Bankruptcy on the Bankruptcy Debtor’s Contracts

The declaration of bankruptcy does not automatically terminate existing contracts and instead the receiver may
in its discretion choose to have the bankruptcy estate itself become party to any such existing contracts. If the
estate enters into the contract and performance by the creditor is due, the creditor may demand that the estate
performs its obligations as well or, if a grace period has been granted, request that the estate, without
unreasonable delay, provides acceptable security for its performance. If performance by the creditor is not due,
the creditor may request security where this is necessary in order to protect against loss. If the estate does not
enter into the contract within a reasonable time after the creditor’s demand or if it does not comply with the
creditor’s request to provide security, the creditor may terminate the contract.

###### Limitations due to capital deficiency

Pursuant to the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. aktiebolagslag (2005:551)), as amended (the “Swedish
Companies Act”), whenever a company’s board of directors has a reason to assume that, as a result of losses or
reductions in the value of the company’s assets or any other event, the company’s equity is less than half the

303


-----

registered share capital, the company’s board of directors shall prepare a special balance sheet (Sw.
_kontrollbalansräkning) and have the auditors examine it. The same obligation arises if the company in_
connection with enforcement pursuant to Chapter 4 of the Swedish Enforcement Code (Sw. utsökningsbalken
_(1981:774)) is found to lack sizeable assets._

If the special balance sheet presented at the initial shareholders’ meeting fails to show that, on the date of such
meeting, the equity of the company amounts to the registered share capital and the initial shareholders’ meeting
has not resolved that the company shall go into liquidation, the shareholders’ meeting shall, within eight months
of the initial shareholders’ meeting, reconsider the issue of whether the company shall go into liquidation
(second shareholders’ meeting). However, if the company undergoes company restructuring during the eightmonth time period, a second shareholders’ meeting need not be held earlier than two months after the
restructuring terminated. Prior to the second shareholders’ meeting, the board of directors shall prepare a new
special balance sheet and cause such to be reviewed by the company’s auditors. The new special balance sheet
and an auditor’s report thereon shall be presented at the second shareholders’ meeting.

If the special balance sheet presented at the initial shareholders’ meeting fails to show that, on the date of such
meeting, the equity of the company amounts to the registered share capital and the initial shareholders’ meeting
has not resolved that the company shall go into liquidation, the shareholders’ meeting shall, within eight months
of the initial shareholders’ meeting, reconsider the issue of whether the company shall go into liquidation
(second shareholders’ meeting). Prior to the second shareholders’ meeting, the board of directors shall prepare
a new special balance sheet and cause such to be reviewed by the company’s auditors. The new special balance
sheet and an auditor’s report thereon shall be presented at the second shareholders’ meeting.

A shareholders’ resolution on liquidation of the company shall be registered with the Swedish Companies
Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket), which shall appoint a liquidator. Should the shareholders not resolve on
such voluntary liquidation where required (which is where (i) a second shareholders’ meeting is not held within
the period of time stated above, or (ii) the new special balance sheet which was presented at the second
shareholders’ meeting was not reviewed by the company’s auditor or fails to show that, on the date of such
meeting, the equity of the company amounts to at least the registered share capital), the court may put the
company into compulsory liquidation and appoint a liquidator. The liquidator takes over management and
control of the company and shall sell the company’s assets and settle the company’s debts with the proceeds.
The liquidator shall give notice to the company’s unknown creditors and creditors that have not lodged their
claims with the liquidator within six months following such notice will have forfeited their rights to their claims.

###### Foreign Currency

Swedish courts may award judgments in currencies other than Swedish kronor, but the judgment debtor has the
right to pay the judgment debt, even though denominated in a foreign currency, in Swedish kronor at the rate
of exchange prevailing at the date of payment.

###### Norway

 Limitations on Guarantees and security interests

The obligations of a Guarantor incorporated in Norway (each a “Norwegian Obligor”) under a Guarantee or in
connection with any security interest provided under any security documents, will be limited by such mandatory
provisions of law applicable to that Norwegian Obligor limiting the legal capacity or ability of the Norwegian
Obligor to grant or honor its guarantee and/or security obligations as provided for in this offering memorandum,
including, but not limited to, the provisions of Sections 8-7 and 8-10 of the Norwegian Private Limited Liability
Companies Acts of 13 June 1997 no. 44 (No. aksjeloven) and the Norwegian Public Limited Liability
Companies Acts of 13 June 1997 no. 45 (No. allmennaksjeloven) (together, the “Norwegian Companies Acts”).

304


-----

Section 8-7 of the Norwegian Companies Acts restricts a Norwegian limited liability company from granting
credit to, guaranteeing or providing security for the obligations of, its (direct and indirect) shareholders (or any
affiliates of its shareholders) beyond its distributable reserves (free equity) and furthermore, it may only provide
such assistance if adequate security is provided in favor of the company’s repayment/recourse claim against
that shareholder or affiliate. Whether the granting of credit, guarantee or security is in compliance with the
Norwegian Companies Acts has to be determined at the time such credit, guarantee or security is provided.

The above restrictions in Section 8-7 of the Norwegian Companies Acts are, however, subject to certain
exceptions and the restrictions do not apply to any credit, guarantee or security provided for the obligations of
(i) its direct or indirect Norwegian parent company and its Norwegian and foreign subsidiaries, provided that
the parent company is a Norwegian limited liability company (No. morselskap) or (ii) its direct or indirect
foreign parent company and its subsidiaries, provided that the parent company has decisive influence over the
Norwegian company (typically meaning it owns more than 50 per cent. of the shares in the Norwegian
company) and provided that the credit, guarantee or security has been made in the “financial interest of the
group. It is somewhat uncertain how this term shall be interpreted, however, the general perception in Norway
seems to be that the term “the group’s financial interests” covers quite a wide range of transactions, but that for
instance transactions whose sole purpose is to benefit the shareholders of the company and not the group (such
as dividend recap-transactions and the like), will not be covered by this exception. Pursuant to the preparatory
works of the Norwegian Companies Acts, this condition will not be satisfied if funds from a Norwegian Obligor
are being utilized solely to the benefit of the group’s ultimate shareholders (for example, financing distributions
to the owners).

In addition to the restrictions with respect to upstream and cross-stream loans, guarantees and security outlined
above, Section 8-10 of the Norwegian Companies Acts restricts a Norwegian limited liability company from
granting any financial assistance (in other words, making assets available, granting credit or providing
guarantees or security) in connection with the acquisition of shares in itself or its direct or indirect parent
company, and these restrictions apply irrespective of whether the company whose shares are being acquired is
a Norwegian or a foreign company. In order for such financial assistance to be valid and binding, the financial
exposure of the Norwegian company providing financial assistance cannot exceed the distributable reserves
(free equity) of the company, and the financial assistance must also be granted according to “ordinary
commercial terms and principles.”

Following certain amendments to the Norwegian Companies Acts that came into force January 1, 2020, the
restriction limiting the financial assistance to the Norwegian company’s free equity does not apply if (i) the
acquirer of the shares is domiciled in the European Economic Area, (ii) the Norwegian company is, or will
following the acquisition, form part of the same group as the acquirer (in other words, be controlled by the
acquirer following the acquisition), (iii) the financial assistance is granted on customary commercial terms and
principles and (iv) certain "whitewash" procedures are complied with prior to the granting of such financial
assistance.

With respect to the aforementioned whitewash procedures, Section 8-10 provides that for a Norwegian company
to grant financial assistance in connection with an acquisition of shares in itself or its (direct or indirect) parent
company, its board of directors must issue a report (Nw. redegjørelse) where it makes an assessment of the
creditworthiness of the beneficiary of the financial assistance and also gives an account of the background and
the terms of the financial assistance in question. The board report must also include a declaration to the effect
that (1) it will be in the interest of the company to grant the financial assistance, and (2) that the company will
have sufficient equity and liquidity as required by the Norwegian Companies Acts when taking the financial
assistance into account. Further, the report must address the requirement of the financial assistance being
granted on ordinary commercial terms, typically by way of the target company receiving some kind of
consideration for providing the financial support (for example, guarantee commission or similar from the

30


-----

acquirer). The board's decision to provide the financial assistance must thereafter be approved by a majority
representing at least two-thirds of both the votes and share capital represented at the general meeting of
shareholders of the Norwegian company. Finally, the board report and statement by the board must be filed with
the Norwegian Business Register (Nw. Foretaksregisteret) before the financial assistance can be provided.

The Norwegian Companies Acts restricts financial assistance made “in connection with” the acquisition of
shares, which may also cover financial assistance after completion of the acquisition (such as the refinancing
of acquisition debt or the subsequent merger of the target company and the acquiring entity). There must,
however, be sufficient connection both in time and as regards other circumstances surrounding such assistance
for it to be in contravention of Section 8-10.

Section 8-10 explicitly states that the restrictions on financial assistance do not apply to distributions made in
accordance with the other provisions of the Norwegian Companies Acts, such as distributions by way of
dividends, group contributions or share capital reductions.

The issue of corporate benefit may in some situations impose a restriction on a Norwegian limited liability
company’s possibility to offer a guarantee and/or provide security to shareholders in addition to the restrictions
described above. Norwegian law does not have a “clear and well-defined” corporate benefit principle (stating
that transactions that do not sufficiently coincide with the interest or are to the benefit of the company may be
challenged), as you find in many other jurisdictions. Having said that, there are several provisions in the
Norwegian Companies Acts, whose main purpose are to ensure that shareholders and other related parties, board
members, creditors etc., do not get what may be considered an unreasonable benefit at the expense of the
Norwegian company (normally referred to as “abuse of lawful authority”) and/or secure maximum
profits/return for the company and its shareholders.

Financial assistance, guarantees or security infringing the limitations set out in Sections 8-7 and Section 8-10
of the Norwegian Companies Acts may be declared void if challenged and may give rise to directors’ liability
issues. If a credit, guarantee or security is provided in contravention of these rules, any funds paid out will have
to be repaid to the company. Typically, the financial assistance restrictions set out in Sections 8-7 and 8-10 are
dealt with by including so-called “limitation language” in the relevant finance documents (to the effect that the
Norwegian limited liability company only guarantees and secures the relevant obligations to the extent the same
would not be in breach of those restrictions).

###### Creation and enforcement of security

Norwegian law strictly requires written statutory basis for establishing a security interest. Although it is not
possible for a Norwegian company to provide a fixed or floating charge over all its present and future assets,
Norwegian law provides for effectively creating security over a range of closely defined asset types. For
example, floating charges may be established over certain asset types of a Norwegian company.

As a main rule, a secured creditor does not have a general step-in right to security assets in an enforcement
situation and agreements on enforcement cannot validly be entered into prior to the occurrence of an event of
default. Instead, enforcement must be sought through the Norwegian courts and/or the Norwegian enforcement
authorities. However, this is different for financial instruments, such as shares in a Norwegian limited liability
company. If the secured party is a financial institution or bond trustee, the shares are considered financial
collateral, and the parties are free (within reasonable limits) to agree on the enforcement process in the share
pledge agreement.

Also, for specific security assets, and under certain circumstances, a creditor may take possession or directly
enforce its rights upon enforcement. This is the case for security established over receivables (such as trade
receivables or bank account claims) whereby the secured party may instruct the relevant debtor to pay the
outstanding amounts directly to the secured party instead of to the chargor.

306


-----

The concept of a security trustee, as it is understood under common law, does not exist under Norwegian law.
In practice, in an arrangement with a security agent acting on behalf of the secured parties, as these exist from
time to time, it is generally recognized under Norwegian law that the security agent will be able to enforce the
security on behalf of the secured parties and apply any proceeds to the secured parties. In order to commence
any legal action regarding a claim (for enforcement purposes or otherwise) against the debtor the security agent
may, however, be required to disclose to the court the identity of the creditors and have the creditors join in or
participate as claimants in the proceedings. It has been established by the Norwegian Supreme Court that a bond
trustee for an undisclosed number of bondholders can, based on the provisions in the bond agreement, take legal
action against the issuer on behalf of and in lieu of the bondholders and without having to disclose the identity
of the bondholders.

###### Insolvency—Bankruptcy

Norwegian insolvency legislation is contained in the Norwegian Bankruptcy Act of June 8, 1984 no. 58 (the
“Norwegian Bankruptcy Act”), which sets out the various procedures to be followed, and the Creditors
Recovery Act of June 8, 1984 no. 59 (the “Norwegian Recovery Act”) containing _inter alia_ provisions
regulating priority of claims and revocation of certain pre-liquidation transactions.

Norwegian insolvency legislation (save for the provisional Norwegian Reconstruction Act described below)
prioritize the timely recovery and realization of underlying assets, rather than the rescue of the company/debtor
as such, and generally follow internationally recognized standards with: (i) a seizure and subsequent disposal
of debtor’s assets, (ii) assessment and ranking of claims, (iii) testing and revocation of transactions made prior
to bankruptcy, and (iv) continued operation of the company at the risk of, and (in practice) only if guaranteed
by, creditors.

Norwegian bankruptcy proceedings are opened following a petition from a creditor or the debtor itself to the
local court where the debtor has its headquarters. The court will request a cash deposit of NOK 62,150 (as of
2023) from the petitioning creditor (does not apply to the debtor or employee-initiated bankruptcy) to secure
court fees and basic costs related to the proceedings.

The court reviews whether the procedural and material requirements for opening the procedures are fulfilled. A
petition from a creditor will be served on the debtor, and a court hearing will take place usually within two or
three weeks after the petition has been filed with the court. The court will, pre-judicially, review any objections
the debtor might have to the petition (for example, whether the creditor holds a valid claim or the debtor’s
possible counterclaim, among others). Bankruptcy proceedings may only be opened if the debtor is deemed to
be insolvent.

There are two requirements for a debtor to be deemed to be insolvent. The debtor must (i) be unable to service
its debt as it becomes due, such payment difficulties not being of a temporary nature and (ii) the debtor must be
in deficit (the company’s debts must exceed the sum of its assets and revenue, based on real, not book, values).

The bankrupt company will be controlled by the court appointed liquidator (a lawyer). The liquidator is often
assisted and supervised by a creditors’ committee, also appointed by the court. A liquidator would be in control
of the company’s property following insolvency and the liquidator will generally adhere to the wishes of the
secured creditor as the liquidator’s main purpose is to dispose of the property.

The general task of the liquidator is to turn all assets into cash in the manner assumed to be most profitable for
the estate (i.e. the creditors) and then distribute the available cash to the creditors. All the company’s assets will
in practice be seized and the debtor may not dispose of the seized assets in any way while the bankruptcy
proceedings are ongoing.

The liquidator can decide that the business will continue to trade only if this is regarded as being in the best
interest of the estate as such. New debt incurred by the estate will be regarded as preferential debts. The

30


-----

liquidator will therefore normally seek to obtain guarantees from creditors in favor of the estate (to cover debts
to suppliers, etc.).

Secured creditors are, in principle, not deemed to be part of the bankruptcy proceedings to the extent the value
of the security is sufficient to cover the underlying obligations of the debtor. The secured creditors may, in
principle, realize the security, and cover their claims, however, keeping in mind that the realization of a number
of categories of security during the first six months after the opening of a bankruptcy will be subject to the
approval of the bankruptcy estate (the same principles apply to official debt negotiations). The bankruptcy estate
has the right, subject to certain conditions being fulfilled, to realize the security with a wiping out effect on
unmet liens and divide the proceeds between the secured creditors and others holding legal rights in the assets.

Furthermore, the bankruptcy estate has a statutory first lien of up to 5 per cent. of the estimated value or sales
value of all assets (except financial collateral) owned by the debtor for its own debt.

In Norwegian bankruptcies, the creditors will be paid according to the following priority:

(i) secured claims (are covered to the extent of the value of the secured asset; any remaining balance is
“transferred” to “ordinary claims”);

(ii) claims which arise during the bankruptcy proceedings, liquidators’ costs, obligations of the estate;

(iii) salary claims (within certain limitations);

(iv) tax claims (for example, withholding tax and VAT within certain limitations);

(v) ordinary claims (pari passu: unsecured debt, trade creditors, indemnity claims etc.); and

(vi) subordinated debt.

Pursuant to the Norwegian Recovery Act, the bankruptcy estate may be entitled to set aside or reverse
transactions carried out in the three to twelve-month period (and, in respect of transactions in favor of related
parties, up to two years) before the opening of the bankruptcy, such as extraordinary payments of certain
creditors, security established for existing debt and transactions at an under-value. The bankruptcy estate may
also, under certain circumstances, be entitled to set aside or reverse transactions made in bad faith or negligently
which in an improper manner increase the debtor’s debt, favor one or more creditors at the expense of others or
deprive the debtor of assets which may otherwise have served to cover the creditors’ claims, in which case the
time limit for challenges by the estate is increased to 10 years.

###### Insolvency—Reconstruction

The provisional Norwegian Provisional Reconstruction Act of May 7, 2020 No. 38 (the “Norwegian
Reconstruction Act”) relates to restructuring to alleviate financial difficulties resulting from the COVID-19
outbreak. Reconstruction is a law regulated “instrument” by which the debtor may seek bankruptcy protection
and protection from debt recovery proceedings, with the aim to reorganize the business and reach a composition
agreement with the creditors. The reconstruction proceedings are regulated by the Norwegian Reconstruction
Act, replacing, subject to certain exceptions, Part I of the Norwegian Bankruptcy Act for as long as the
Reconstruction Act remains in effect. The Norwegian Reconstruction Act will be in effect until 1 July 2025,
when it is contemplated that it will be replaced by a permanent reconstruction act.

Reconstruction proceedings may be initiated by the courts after petition from the debtor or, on certain
conditions, from creditors (but may not be instituted against the will of the debtor).

In order for the courts to open reconstruction proceedings, the debtor must be encountering, or will in the
foreseeable future encounter, severe financial difficulties.

308


-----

If the petition is granted, the Court shall appoint a reconstructor (who shall be an insolvency lawyer) and a
creditors committee (the “Reconstruction Committee”).

The key feature of the reconstruction proceedings is that all creditor collection steps are suspended, in particular:

- Payment of all pre-petition debt is suspended

- The debtor is protected from creditor initiated bankruptcy and debt recovery and enforcement
proceedings (except for financial collateral) while the debtor’s business is being reconstructed

- The debtor’s business is under the supervision of the Reconstruction Committee

The aim of the proceedings is in essence a reconstruction of the debtor’s business and to reduce the risk of
unnecessary bankruptcy of viable businesses.

The Reconstruction Act distinguishes between voluntary composition and compulsory composition. A
voluntary composition may in principle include any possible arrangement or composition. However, it requires
an approval from each and every one of the creditors, and is only binding on those creditors who have
participated in the composition (for example, not on “unknown” creditors). In a compulsory reconstruction,
there are limitations with respect to the contents of the proposal. It is however binding on the minority of
creditors, and also on unknown creditors.

Pursuant to the Reconstruction Act a voluntarily reconstruction may include (and a compulsory composition
can only include) a:

(i) Moratorium (i.e. extension of maturity/payment holiday);

(ii) percentage reduction of the debt (payment of a cash dividend as full/partial settlement);

(iii) full or partial conversion of debt to equity (generally only applicable to consenting creditors);

(iv) transfer of all or parts of the debtor’s business and assets, without liquidation;

(v) transfer and liquidation of all or parts of the debtor’s business and assets, discharging the debtor of the
obligations not covered by the liquidation; or

(vi) a combination of the above mentioned measures.

The proposed composition, together with the recommendation from the Reconstruction Committee, is
distributed to all creditors included in the composition, and the creditors are requested to confirm to the
Reconstruction Committee whether or not the proposed composition is accepted.

The creditors must accept or reject the composition within a time limit of minimum two, and maximum three
weeks.

The voluntary composition is considered approved when it has been accepted by all the creditors included in

the composition. A compulsory composition is considered approved when it has been accepted by [1]⁄2 of the
voting creditors (in value).

If the proposed composition is rejected by any of the creditors, the proposal may be subject to negotiations and
amended. The new proposal may be distributed to the creditors, always provided that the Reconstruction
Committee considers that the amended debt composition is likely to be obtained. If the amended proposal is
rejected, no further proposals may be distributed.

The only claims which may be excluded from the debt composition are preferential claims (salary and tax
deduction claims), secured claims, valid counterclaims, and claims below a defined threshold set out in the
proposed composition.

309

###### Solvent enforcement

Enforcement of security normally requires that the secured party files an application to the enforcement
authorities for the enforcement of the security. Certain types of security may, however, be enforced without the
involvement of the enforcement authority or a court, typically security established pursuant to the Financial
Collateral Act of March 26, 2004 no. 17 and charges over monetary claims. A provision granting the secured
party such right of enforcement is typically included in any security agreement between the pledgor/chargor
and the secured party.

Enforcement of a guarantee claim against a solvent guarantor will in principal require a final, legally binding
judgment by a court (unless the guarantee is made as an enforceable promissory note). Thereafter the creditor
may apply to the enforcement authorities for enforcement of his or her claim.

###### Finland

 Applicable Insolvency Law

In the event of threatening or actual insolvency of a Finnish company, insolvency proceedings may be initiated
in Finland. Our Finnish guarantors are incorporated and have their centre of main interests in Finland. According
to regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council on Insolvency Proceedings (recast)
(“Insolvency Regulation”), main insolvency proceedings including a Finnish company and their effects would,
as a main rule, be governed by Finnish law. In case insolvency proceedings are connected to another EU member
state within the meaning of the Insolvency Regulation (, and provided that said regulation is applied to such EU
member state, the provisions of the Insolvency Regulation shall apply.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the Finnish insolvency law.

The provisions of the Finnish Bankruptcy Act (FI: Konkurssilaki, 120/2004, as amended, “Bankruptcy Act”),
the Finnish Restructuring of Enterprises Act (FI: Laki yrityksen saneerauksesta, 47/1993, as amended,
“Restructuring Act”) and the Finnish Act on the Recovery of Assets to the Bankruptcy Estate (FI: Laki
takaisinsaannista konkurssipesään 758/1991, as amended, “Recovery Act”) are particularly relevant to this
discussion.

Under Finnish law, if there is an imminent risk of a company becoming insolvent or the company is already
insolvent but it is probable that a company restructuring would remedy the company’s insolvency, the company
may be placed in a company restructuring (FI: _yrityssaneeraus). There are two types of restructuring_
proceedings stipulated in the Restructuring Act: 1) early (preventive) restructuring (FI: varhaissaneeraus) and
2) regular restructuring (FI: perusmuotoinen saneeraus). Alternatively, if a company is insolvent, the company
may be subjected to bankruptcy proceedings (FI: konkurssi).

In addition to company restructuring and bankruptcy, a Finnish limited liability company may also be subject
to liquidation (FI: selvitystila) under the Finnish Companies Act (FI: Osakeyhtiölaki, 624/2006, as amended).
However, liquidation proceedings are voluntary and are used in practice to dissolve a solvent company. In cases
where a solvent company is subject to liquidation, there is an obligation for the liquidator to conclude liquidation
proceedings and file for bankruptcy if it later turns out that the company’s known debts cannot be fully settled
in liquidation. Thus, considerations regarding liquidation proceedings are not addressed in the following.

###### Company Restructuring

An application for early or regular company restructuring can be filed with a court by the debtor. An application
for regular restructuring can also be filed by one or more creditors.

310


-----

If the company is in a state of imminent insolvency (i.e. otherwise than only temporarily unable to pay debts
when due), it may file for early restructuring. Filing for early restructuring is not possible if state of insolvency
has already been reached.

A debtor (or creditor) may file for regular restructuring on the basis of insolvency if it is probable that company
restructuring would remedy the insolvency or prevent its recurrence otherwise than temporarily., The initiation
of regular restructuring proceedings is also possible without analysis of the debtor company’s solvency
situation, when at least two creditors not related to the debtor whose total claims represent at least one-fifth of
the debtor’s known debts file a joint application with the debtor or declare that they support the debtor’s
application for regular restructuring.

If there are no specific barriers to restructuring under the Restructuring Act and, consequently, the court
approves the application and commences restructuring proceedings, the court will simultaneously appoint a
restructuring administrator (FI: selvittäjä). The purpose of restructuring proceedings is to investigate whether
the debtor’s business has a reasonable chance to continue profitably and, if so, to rehabilitate the company’s
viable business, ensure its continued viability, make debt arrangements and execute other restructuring
measures. The Board of Directors and the Managing Director continue to act on behalf of the company during
the restructuring proceedings. The restructuring administrator’s right to receive information of the debtor
company’s business is extensive. The administrator is entitled to review the debtor company’s books and
business documents and obtain any information on the company’s business activities, as well as to participate
in meetings of the debtor’s corporate bodies such as board meetings. The restructuring administrator’s consent
is required for certain legal acts of a significant nature of the debtor company specified in the Restructuring
Act.

As a general rule, the commencement of restructuring proceedings has no effect on the debtor’s existing
contracts. However, there are some exceptions set forth in the Restructuring Act regarding premature
termination of certain contracts, such as lease agreements, unfulfilled contracts not deemed to be a regular part
of the activities of the debtor and employment relationships. As of June 1, 2023 the termination right will expand
even to indefinite and fixed-term contracts in which the debtor is committed to repeated and/or continuous nonmonetary performance.

###### Moratorium

In early restructuring, the court will decide upon a moratorium when deciding on the respective application for
early restructuring. A moratorium is imposed if the application is approved, and the court deems that it is not
likely that such an order is unnecessary e.g. based on creditors’ views on low expectations of a successful
restructuring.

In regular restructuring, all existing claims against the debtor company that have arisen before the filing of the
restructuring application (“restructuring debt”) are suspended as of the commencement of the company
restructuring.

As a main rule, moratorium results in several interdictions regarding restructuring debts including a prohibition
over:

1. repayment and placing of security,

2. debt collection measures including enforcement of security provided by the debtor,

3. enforcement measures through the enforcement authority, and

4. precautionary measures, such as seizure of assets.

311


-----

At the request of the applicant the court may order in both early and regular restructuring that a moratorium is
in effect on an interim basis already prior to the commencement of restructuring proceedings (in other words,
shortly after the filing of the application for the restructuring proceedings).

In early restructuring, the moratorium is in force three months at a time and in maximum 12 months from when
the first order over (interim or actual) moratorium became in force. In regular restructuring, the moratorium is
in force until the restructuring program has been affirmed by the court or the proceedings have been, for reasons
specified in the Restructuring Act, dismissed or interrupted.

By default, the moratorium does not prevent the collection of a restructuring debt from a guarantor, joint debtor
or from the value of a collateral provided by a third party, nor the giving of notice or otherwise terminating the
debt for the part of the guarantor or the provider of the collateral provided that the guarantee, joint debt or
collateral had been given in the context of business operations or other comparable activities.

Debts arising on the date when the restructuring application has been filed and thereafter are not, as a general
rule, considered restructuring debt, but new debt, and must be repaid as they become due. The same applies to
fees, charges and other running expenses (for example, lease payments) based on a continuous contractual
relationship or on a continuous contract regarding the use or possession of assets, to the extent as these relate
to the period subsequent to the filing of the application.

###### Debt Arrangements

Creditors with equal ranking receivables have an equal status in the arrangements of the restructuring debts
within the restructuring program.

Subject to certain restrictions set forth in the Restructuring Act, the following measures may be taken with
respect to unsecured restructuring debts: (i) changing the repayment schedule; (ii) ordering that debt payments
be considered as payments against principal first, and as payments of interest and other credit costs only after
the repayment of the principal; (iii) reducing the obligation to pay interest and other credit costs with respect to
the remaining term of a debt; and (iv) reducing the outstanding principal balance of unpaid debt. The
restructuring program may also include the full or partial refinancing of debt, either as a lump sum funded by
the issuance of new debt or with payments in lieu of performance that are considered reasonable having regard
to the creditor’s field of business and position.

Secured debt means restructuring debt where a creditor holds an effective (against third parties) security interest
over assets that belong to or are in the possession of the debtor, in so far as the value of the security at the
commencement of the proceedings would have been sufficient to cover the amount of the creditor’s claim after
the deduction of liquidation costs and claims with a higher priority. When the interdiction of restructuring debt
collection is in force, assets pledged by the debtor company as security cannot be liquidated by the pledge
holder during restructuring proceedings; instead, secured creditors’ receivables receive preferential treatment
based on the value of the security; most importantly their principal cannot be reduced (“cut”) in the restructuring
program up to the value of the security. The part of the creditor’s claim that is not covered by the value of the
security does not qualify as secured debt but, instead, is regarded as unsecured debt for the purposes of the
restructuring proceedings and may, thus be subject to the measures described above. Regarding business
mortgages, only 50 per cent of the value of the mortgaged assets will be considered as secured debt. The value
of the assets will be determined in the restructuring program.

The following debt arrangements may be applied to secured debt: (i) changing the repayment schedule; (ii)
ordering that debt payments be applied as payments against principal first and as payments of interest and other
credit costs second; or (iii) reducing the obligation to pay interest and other credit costs with respect to the
remaining term of the debt. The restructuring program may also include the full or partial refinancing of secured
debt as a lump sum payment funded by the issuance of new debt.

312


-----

Even if the debt arrangement does not affect the existence or content of a creditor’s security interest, the security
arrangements relating to the debt may be altered by replacing the security with another fully adequate security.

Payments on a secured debt shall be set so that at least the present value of the secured debt will be repaid
within a reasonable period, which shall not materially exceed the remainder of the credit period without the
consent of the creditor or, if the debt has become due in full, materially exceed half of the original credit period.
As for reducing interest and other credit costs, the length of the remaining credit period should be taken into
consideration in the restructuring program, so that the longer the remaining credit period, the smaller the
reduction in interest and credit costs.

###### Approval of the Restructuring Program

The restructuring program draft shall be drawn up by the restructuring administrator. Restructuring program
draft may also be prepared by the debtor and subject to certain prerequisites creditor(s). The court shall affirm
the program subject to the approval of all the known creditors or with the acceptance of a majority of the voting
creditors in creditor groups in accordance with the Restructuring Act. The creditors shall be divided into voting
groups as follows: (1) Secured creditors; (2) Creditors holding a floating charge as security for their claims; (3)
Unsecured creditors, (4) Unsecured creditors whose claims may be enforced without a judgment or court order
(such as tax receivables); and (4) Creditors with the lowest-priority claims. However, there are some specific
limitations under the Restructuring Act relating to the affirmation of the restructuring program which apply
even if the restructuring program is approved by all creditors or the majority in all groups of creditors.
Furthermore, even if the majority does not exist in one or several groups of creditors, the restructuring program
may nonetheless be approved at the request of the person who has prepared the draft program, the administrator
or the debtor, subject to the terms specified in the Restructuring Act (cross class cram down). In such a case the
restructuring claims of the creditors in favour of the program must represent at minimum one-fifth of all
restructuring claims of the debtor company taken into consideration in the voting procedure in accordance with
the Restructuring Act and at least one group of creditors must have voted for the approval of the program by
majority. There is also a possibility of affirmation on the restructuring program in expedited proceedings
(“Expedited Affirmation”) provided that the program is supported, in writing, by creditors whose claims total
at least 80 per cent of the overall total claims of the creditors, and from each creditor whose claim is at least 5
per cent of the overall total claims of the creditors.

As of June 1, 2023, the prerequisites for Expedited Affirmation are amended so that Expedited Affirmation is
available when the program is supported by creditors whose claims total at least 70 per cent. of the overall total
claims of the creditors, and by each creditor whose claim is at least 10 per cent. of the overall total claims of
the creditors. Alternatively, Expedited Affirmation is available if the program is supported by creditors whose
claims total at least 60 per cent. of the overall total claims of the creditors, and by each creditor whose claim is
at least 10 per cent. of the overall total claims of the creditors if the debtor is obliged to settle at least 25 per
cent. of each creditor’s claim within one year from the affirmation of the program.

###### Bankruptcy

A debtor or a creditor as qualified in the Bankruptcy Act may apply for bankruptcy from a court of competent
jurisdiction when the debtor is unable to pay its debts when due and the inability to pay is not temporary (i.e.
the company is considered insolvent). If the application is approved, an estate administrator (or, exceptionally,
several estate administrators) (FI: pesänhoitaja) will be appointed by the court.

A bankruptcy covers all the liabilities of the debtor, and its objective is to liquidate the assets of the debtor and
use the proceeds received deducted with expenses of the bankruptcy estate in payment of the bankruptcy
creditors’ claims. The bankruptcy estate may also (subject to the bankruptcy creditors’ decision) continue the
company’s business operations even if this is in practice rare. The debtor’s assets are, from the beginning of the
bankruptcy, subject to the authority of the estate administrator. The bankruptcy creditors are represented through

313


-----

the creditors’ meeting. The estate administrator must act for the common benefit of all bankruptcy creditors and
shall comply with the decisions and guidelines of the bankruptcy creditors in matters falling within the decisionmaking powers of the creditors.

###### Notices to the Bankruptcy Estate with regard to Claims

As a main rule, in order to be entitled to a disbursement (FI: jako-osuus), a creditor must lodge a claim in writing
with the estate administrator by the lodgement date set by the estate administrator (FI: _konkurssivalvonta)._
However, there are some specific exceptions in the Bankruptcy Act according to which a claim is to be taken
into account without it being filed.

Information concerning the lodgement date shall be sent to the Legal Register Centre (FI:
_Oikeusrekisterikeskus), the debtor and all known creditors. If there are a lot of unknown creditors or other_
reasons, the information can also be published in the Official Journal of Finland (FI: Virallinen lehti).

The obligation to notify the bankruptcy estate of a claim is binding even on a creditor with a secured claim. A
creditor who holds assets belonging to the debtor as security for the debt of a third party must, at the request of,
and within a time limit set by the estate administrator, provide the same information on the receivables and
security as should be provided in a lodgement of claim. A creditor who holds a business mortgage over the
assets of the debtor, as referred to in the Finnish Business Mortgages Act (FI: Yrityskiinnityslaki 634/1984, as
amended), as security for a claim against the debtor in bankruptcy or a debt owed by some other debtor shall
file the claim as provided in the Bankruptcy Act. If a claim is denominated in a currency other than euro, the
value in euro for the purposes of the bankruptcy proceedings is determined using the exchange rate of the date
of commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings.

A creditor who wishes to use his or her claim for set-off against a debt owed to the debtor must, when giving
notice of the set-off, provide the estate administrator with the same information that would be provided in a
lodgement of claim. The notice of set-off must be made at the latest on the lodgement date.

###### Disbursements

The estate administrator draws up a list of how the proceeds of the estate are to be divided among the creditors
(“draft disbursement list”, FI: _jakoluetteloehdotus). The court affirms that the estate administrator’s draft_
disbursement list meets the statutory requirements and that the procedural provisions relating to the draft
disbursement list have been observed. A creditor may make statements on the draft disbursement list in so far
as it concerns another creditor’s claim or its own lodgement of claim. A creditor may dispute the claim of
another creditor or its precedence of rank, as entered into the draft disbursement list. After having heard the
creditors and the debtor, the estate administrator will draw up a (final) disbursement list by revising the draft
disbursement list as he or she sees fit on the basis of the disputes and statements. The estate administrator’s
disbursement list shall be submitted to the court for affirmation.

According to the Finnish Act on the Order of Payment of Creditors (1578/1992, as amended, FI: Laki velkojien
_maksunsaantijärjestyksestä), the claims are satisfied in the following order of priority:_

(i) creditors of secured claims (excluding claims secured by business mortgage) and holders of retention rights,
with priority over the proceeds from the respective security asset;

(ii) creditors of the administrative expenses of the bankruptcy estate and claims on the basis of contracts that
the bankruptcy estate has assumed or entered into;

(iii) if the company has undergone early or regular restructuring proceedings before the bankruptcy, (A) fees
and expenses of the restructuring administrator with interest on delayed payments until the satisfaction of the
debt and (B) debts that have arisen between the commencement and discontinuation of restructuring
proceedings with interest on delayed payments until the satisfaction of the debt;

314


-----

(iv) creditors with claims that are secured by a business mortgage will receive 50 per cent of the value of the
mortgaged assets; and

(v) unsecured creditors have an equal right to payment out of the proceeds of the bankruptcy estate in the
proportion of the amount of their claims. In case of secured claims and claims secured by business mortgage,
any debt exceeding the value of the assets pledged as collateral is considered unsecured debt, unless these fall
under another category of precedence.

Certain claims are settled after all other claims. In practice, the most significant of such claims is interest
accruing on bankruptcy debt after the commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings, a bond that pursuant to
its terms ranks after all the other obligations of the issuer and a subordinated loan that in insolvency and
liquidation may be settled only after all the other claims. The Finnish state has no preferential rights regarding
taxes and other fiscal charges.

###### Enforcement of pledged property

The assets of the bankruptcy estate are to be liquidated (sold or otherwise disposed of) in the most advantageous
manner so as to maximize the aggregate net realisation proceeds, for example by way of auctions, through
advertising and direct solicitation of potential buyers. However, creditors that are secured pursuant to a security
interest over movable or immovable property for their bankruptcy receivables may enforce such security
regardless of the bankruptcy proceedings. Such right is not available for creditors secured by business mortgage.

The estate administrator may at their own discretion prohibit the sale of pledged property for a maximum of
two months, but only once. The bankruptcy estate may sell secured assets belonging to the estate only if the
creditor to whom the assets have been pledged as security consents to the same or if the court grants a specific
permission. At the request of the bankruptcy estate, assets of the bankruptcy estate may also be sold in
accordance with the provisions of the Finnish Enforcement Code (705/2007, as amended, FI: Ulosottokaari,
“Enforcement Code”) if the bailiff consents to the same.

###### Recovery of Assets

Pursuant to the Finnish Recovery Act (758/1991, as amended, FI: _Laki takaisinsaannista konkurssipesään)_
certain acts carried out by a debtor can be revoked in bankruptcy if the rights of the creditors have been
prejudiced by or as a result of those acts. According to the Restructuring Act and the Enforcement Code, the
grounds for recovery set forth in the Recovery Act shall also be applied in company restructuring and
enforcement proceedings.

The estate administrator, the restructuring administrator, enforcement authority and certain creditors may seek
for the recovery of assets of the debtor to the bankruptcy estate or the company under restructuring or
enforcement proceedings. The administrator or the creditors may, within a specified time, either file an action
for recovery in court against the debtor’s counterparty involved in the act or dispute a lodgement of claim filed
in bankruptcy. As of June 1, 2023, the period to file an action in both bankruptcy and restructuring proceedings
is one year from the commencement of the respective proceedings or three months from the moment that the
bankruptcy estate or restructuring administrator took note or should have taken note of the grounds for recovery.
Before June 1, 2023, the deadline for filing in early or regular restructuring proceedings is six months.

Certain general rules for recovery apply to all transactions between an insolvent debtor (including a debtor who
becomes insolvent partially due to the transaction) and the counterparty of the debtor. A transaction concluded
within five years prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, company restructuring or enforcement was
filed may be recovered if:

31


-----

(i) the transaction, either by itself or together with other transactions, improperly (a) favors a creditor at the
expense of other creditors, (b) places assets of the debtor beyond the reach of creditors, or (c) increases debts
to the detriment of creditors;

(ii) the debtor, at the time of the transaction, was, or partly due to the transaction became, insolvent, or overindebted in case of a transaction that can be considered a gift or a contract with the characteristics of a gift;

(iii) the counterparty knew or should have known of the insolvency or over-indebtedness, or the relevance of
the transaction to the debtor’s economic situation; and

(iv) the counterparty knew or should have known of the facts mentioned above in item (i), on the basis of which
the transaction is considered improper.

The grounds for recovery under Section 5 of the Recovery Act, which covers all transactions concluded between
the debtor and a counterparty, are thus applicable only if the counterparty had qualified or should have had
qualified knowledge of all the issues described above in items (i) and (ii). Transactions between the debtor and
certain (natural or legal) persons within the debtor’s sphere of interest (closely related parties, FI: läheiset, as
defined in the Recovery Act) may be recovered regardless of the date of the transaction and such persons are
assumed to have had knowledge of the issues described above in items (i) and (ii). Also, the burden of proof
with regard to above mentioned issues, is reversed if the transaction was concluded between such closely related
parties.

Pursuant to the Recovery Act, certain transactions can, in certain circumstances, be recovered regardless of the
good faith of the counterparty and regardless of the solvency of the debtor at the time of the transaction. Such
transactions include, among other things: (i) payments received through enforcement; (ii) the payment of debts;
and (iii) the granting of security or other collateral (and (iv) gifts or contracts with characteristics of a gift,
which shall not be discussed further herein).

Any debt paid later than three months prior to the date when the application for bankruptcy, company
restructuring or enforcement was filed with the court or relevant authority may be recovered if: (i) unusual
means of payment have been used; (ii) the payment was premature; or (iii) the amount of payment was
considerable in comparison to the assets of the debtor. However, a payment may not be recovered if it, when
all circumstances are taken into consideration, may be considered ordinary. A debt paid to a natural or legal
closely related person may be recovered in respect of the longer two-year period unless it is shown that the
debtor, at the time of the payment, was not insolvent or did not become insolvent due to the payment.

A security or other collateral given later than three months prior to the date when the application for bankruptcy,
company restructuring or enforcement was filed with the court or the relevant authority may be recovered if:
(i) the parties had not agreed upon the security in connection with the creation of the debt; or (ii) the possession
of the security had not been transferred or another act perfecting the security had not been completed without
unjustified delay after the creation of the debt. A security given to a natural or legal person considered as a
closely related party may be recovered in respect of the longer two-year period unless it is shown that the debtor
was not insolvent or did not become insolvent due to the arrangements for security.

When a transaction is recovered, the assets that have been received from the debtor are returned to the debtor
or the bankruptcy estate if the debtor is in bankruptcy. The bankruptcy estate also returns the compensation that
potentially had been paid for the assets. If the compensation has been placed beyond the reach of the creditors
and the party that paid the compensation knew or should have known that this was the intention of the debtor,
there is no obligation to return the compensation. If the assets or compensation to be returned no longer exist,
or are otherwise not returnable, compensation for the value of the assets must be made. In addition, should the
return of certain assets cause inconvenience to the party under such obligation, a court may entitle such party

316


-----

to pay compensation equal to the value of the assets instead of returning the assets. The Recovery Act also sets
forth an obligation to compensate for any decrease in value of the returnable assets.

###### Limitations on the validity and enforceability of guarantees and security

Pursuant to the provisions of the Finnish Companies Act (624/2006, as amended, FI: _Osakeyhtiölaki) (the_
“Finnish Companies Act”) a Finnish limited liability company may not provide financing for, or grant
guarantees or security to secure the financing of, the acquisition of its or its parent company’s shares (financial
assistance).

Further, a Finnish limited liability company can only distribute its assets in the ways specified in the Finnish
Companies Act. Other transactions that reduce the assets of a company or increase its liabilities without a
corporate benefit i.e., unless doing so is in the company’s own commercial interest, constitute an unlawful
distribution of assets. Granting of guarantees and security requires that the granting of guarantee/security is
based on sound business reasons (corporate benefit). The business justification for granting the guarantee or
security is assessed on a company-level and on a stand-alone basis. Group benefit can only be taken into regard
in case the issuer of the guarantee or security can be reasonably argued to derive as a member of the group a
benefit itself as a result of the overall group benefit. In addition to the corporate benefit requirement, the granting
of the guarantee/security has to be within the limits of the company’s business purpose (as set out in its articles
of association) and the company may not be insolvent and the granting of security may not result in the company
becoming insolvent.

For the abovementioned reasons, it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees
and security documents to include, where such security is granted for third party liabilities (including other
members of the group), language pursuant to which the scope of guarantees and security granted by limited
liability companies incorporated in Finland is contractually limited so as to not be in conflict with the relevant
statutory limitations. The actual scope of a guarantee issued or security granted by a Finnish obligor may
therefore be substantially less than the aggregate amount of liabilities expressed to be guaranteed or secured
and, in fact, it is possible that owing to the application of mandatory Finnish law relating to unlawful profit
distribution, as applied to the guarantee or security granted, no liabilities or obligations will under Finnish law,
be held to be effectively guaranteed or secured.

###### Creation of a valid security interest

The creation of a valid and enforceable security interest under Finnish law is achieved by pledging the security
assets and perfecting such pledge, typically by transferring such security assets into the exclusive physical
possession of the pledgee. In the event that the physical transfer of the security asset is not possible, the security
interest may, as a general rule, be perfected by way of notice to the relevant third-party debtor (such as the
issuer company in case of share pledge without share certificates, the account bank in case of the pledge of bank
accounts and the pledgor’s debtor in case of receivables). In respect of certain specific asset classes (such as
real estate, qualifying vehicles, ships, aircraft, intellectual property rights and shares in book-entry form), the
perfection of a security interest is achieved by way of registration. Furthermore, the relevant method of
perfection may comprise elements of all three different categorise; in the case of a business mortgage, the
perfection requires both transfer of possession of a physical mortgage note and the registration thereof.

Such Finnish perfection requirements set forth that, in order for the security interest to be effective against third
parties, the security interest must be made publicly observable, and accordingly the pledgor must be effectively
deprived of its right to control, deal with or dispose of the security assets through transfer of possession of the
security asset, notifying the relevant third party of the security interest (and, _inter alia, the redirection of_
payments to the pledgee) and/or, as applicable, registration. If the pledgor remains in possession of, retains
exclusive or shared control over, or remains entitled to operate or collect, invest and dispose of any income
from such assets, the relevant security interest will not be deemed to have been effectively created until it is

31


-----

duly perfected, typically after the occurrence of the agreed trigger event. Perfection cannot be achieved once
insolvency proceedings have been commenced and can be deemed susceptible and be set aside in insolvency
proceedings if perfected within a certain critical time as explained above before the commencement of
insolvency proceedings. Notwithstanding the aforesaid, a business mortgage does not, at the cost of validity of
the security interest, prevent disposals and other use of the mortgaged property required in the ordinary course
of business for the exchange of goods or necessary replacement of property.

###### Enforcement of security

A secured creditor may primarily enforce its security interest and collect its claims by the means available under
applicable Finnish enforcement legislation. As an alternative to the statutory procedures, the parties are, in
general, free to agree on other methods of enforcement, such as the disposal of the property by means of a
voluntary sale. It is, however, mandatory in the light of general principles of Finnish law that the relevant debt
has fallen due and that the pledgor has been given notice to the effect that the pledge object will be sold.
Regardless of the chosen method, the interests of the pledgor must, however, be reasonably considered. Finnish
law imposes a duty of loyalty on the pledgee to take into account the interests of the pledgor in the enforcement
to the extent this will not adversely affect the pledgee’s own rights.

The pledge of most movable assets (such as shares) may be enforced without a court judgment or the
involvement of an enforcement official or, should the pledgee deem it necessary, through official enforcement.
A pledge of shares is typically enforced by private sale and a pledge of receivables either by selling the
receivable or by the secured creditor collecting payment of the receivable. Typically, the collection of
receivables directly from the debtors of the pledgor results in a more expedient and profitable outcome than a
sale of the receivables, both of which are forms of self-enforcement. In case the debtor does not pay the debts
in the due time, the pledgee has the possibility to file a claim to the district court in order to obtain judgement
by default, which can be used as grounds for official enforcement.

The Finnish Commercial Code (3/1734, as amended, Kauppakaari) stipulates a default process in respect of an
enforcement of pledge of movable assets. The parties may, as a rule, contract out most parts of the default
process. The parties’ discretion with regard to the enforcement methods is, however, limited (a) by the statutory
invalidity of a contractual provision providing that title to the pledged asset shall, upon default, automatically
transfer to the pledgee (however, the debtor and creditor may, after the pledgee has become entitled to enforce
the security, effectively agree that an obligation is discharged partly or in full by the pledgee assuming
ownership of the pledged asset), and (b) by the pledgee always having a duty to ascertain that the interests of
the pledgor and other creditors of the pledgor are not unduly jeopardized due to the actions taken by the pledgee.

To enforce a business mortgage, the pledgee needs to have obtained a legally valid judgment outside formal
insolvency procedures; a business mortgage is not immediately enforceable if the pledgor refuses to pay or is
unable to pay in accordance with the agreed terms. In case of insolvency, a creditor holding a business mortgage
enjoys of a right to receive payments once claims secured by other pledges or mortgages have been first satisfied
out of the relevant security assets, which claims also include claims that are by law directly recoverable from
the assets of the bankruptcy estate. Debts secured by a business mortgage are subject to such security interest
up to a maximum of 50 per cent of the value of the assets; any remaining amount not covered by the business
mortgage is treated as an unsecured debt to be satisfied with the same priority as regular unsecured debts. Under
the Finnish Bankruptcy Act, the creditors secured by a business mortgage must secure their claim in a
bankruptcy as ordinary unprivileged creditors and the enforcement of a business mortgage is not distinct from
the bankruptcy itself. If the pledgor is under restructuring pursuant to the Finnish Restructuring of Enterprises
Act, the creditor is in the position of an ordinary creditor of a restructuring debt.

###### SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES

 Sweden

Pursuant to the provisions of Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of
December 12, 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial
matters (hereinafter the “Recast Brussels Regulation,” which apply to proceedings instituted, and judgments
issued, from January 10, 2015), a judgment issued against a company in the courts of a member state of the
European Union (hereinafter a “Member State”) which is enforceable in that Member State, will be directly
enforceable in Sweden provided that the formal requirements in the Recast Brussels Regulation are satisfied.
An application for refusal of enforcement may be lodged with the competent Swedish district court. Where such
application is lodged the Swedish court may stay the proceedings if an ordinary appeal against the judgment
has been lodged in the Member State of origin or the time for such appeal has not yet expired.

Under the 2007 Lugano Convention on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil
and commercial matters (hereinafter the “Lugano Convention”), a judgment issued against a company in the
courts of a member state of the European Union or the European Free Trade Association (hereinafter a
“Contracting State”) which is enforceable in that Contracting State, will be enforceable in Sweden upon the
fulfilment of the following requirements: (a) that a motion for enforcement has been granted by the competent
Swedish district court, and (b) that the formal requirements in the Lugano Convention have been fulfilled.

Judgments issued against a Swedish party in the courts of a state which is not a Member State or a Contracting
State (hereinafter a “Third Country”) are, as a general rule, not legally recognized or enforceable in Sweden.
Instead, a Third Country judgment will be regarded by a Swedish court, administrative tribunal or executive or
other public authority merely as factual evidence of, for example, the outcome or circumstances of the dispute
to which the judgment relates. The United States is a Third Country. Thus, New York law, which is the governing
law of the Notes and the Indenture, falls into the foregoing category. Thus, separate legal proceedings on the
same subject matter must generally be commenced in Sweden. During those proceedings the Swedish court
will, as a general rule, not be bound by the outcome of the Third Country judgment and may choose to try the
dispute without regard to the Third Country judgment. Under certain conditions, including where a contract
under review contains an exclusive jurisdiction clause in favor of the Third Country courts, the Swedish court
will not re-examine the merits of the claim. Instead, the Swedish court in that case may render a judgment based
on the foreign judgment. However, it is nevertheless the Swedish, and not the Third Country, judgment that will
ultimately be enforced. Following the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union and the end of the
United Kingdom’s transition period, the United Kingdom is deemed a Third Country for the purposes of the
Recast Brussels Regulation and the Lugano Convention. However, judgments obtained from a court in the
United Kingdom in respect of an exclusive jurisdiction clause under a contract dated on, or after, January 1,
2021, may thereafter be enforced in accordance with, and subject to the fulfilment of the relevant conditions of,
the 2005 Hague Convention on choice of court agreements, to which the European Union is a contracting state
and the United Kingdom acceded effective from January 1, 2021. Consequently, judgments obtained from a
court in the United Kingdom and which either do not fulfil the foregoing requirements or which relate to a
contract dated prior to January 1, 2021, may not be enforced in accordance with the Hague Convention.

Foreign arbitral awards are enforceable in Sweden pursuant to the Swedish Arbitration Act which reflects the
rules of the New York Convention (to which Sweden has acceded).

###### Norway

Pursuant to the Norwegian Enforcement Act of June 26, 1992 No 86, a civil judgment/ruling or in-court
settlement (a “judgment”) against a Norwegian party passed by the courts of a foreign state may be recognized
and enforced in Norway if (i) this follows from Norwegian law or agreement with the foreign state in question,
or (ii) the jurisdiction of the foreign court has been specifically agreed between the parties in a particular civil

326


-----

matter in accordance with the Norwegian Civil Procedure Act of June 17, 2005 No. 90 section 4-6. Pursuant to
the Norwegian Dispute Act of June 17, 2005 No. 90 section 4-8, the Lugano Convention on Jurisdiction and
the Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters applies as Norwegian law.
However, the Lugano Convention does not apply to (i) the status or legal capacity of natural persons, rights in
property arising out of a matrimonial relationship, wills and succession; (ii) bankruptcy, proceedings relating
to the winding up of insolvent companies or other legal persons, judicial arrangements, compositions and
analogous proceedings; (iii) social security; (iv) arbitration.

Furthermore, a judgment will only be recognized or enforced as a matter of right if it is (i) enforceable in and
pursuant to the laws of the country in which it has been passed, and (ii) the recognition and enforcement of the
judgment is not considered to be in conflict with public policy (“ordre public”).

The foregoing could imply, inter alia, that judgments by U.S. courts may not be recognized or enforced in
Norway as a matter of right, unless the parties have agreed to the jurisdiction of the U.S. court in question.
However, judgments that are not recognized or enforced may be admissible as evidence in the courts of law,
executive or other public authorities of Norway and may, assuming the same applicable law applies (lex causae),
in such capacity carry persuasive authority depending on the merits of the judgment limiting the need for a full
retrial on its merits.

Civil judgements rendered by the courts of the United Kingdom will be recognized and enforced in Norway
pursuant to the bilateral agreement with the United Kingdom dated October 13, 2020, declaring the continued
application of the bilateral convention between the United Kingdom and Norway providing reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil matters dated June 12, 1961.

Foreign arbitral awards are enforceable in Norway pursuant to the Norwegian Arbitration Act of 14 May, 2004
No 25 section 45 and 46 which reflects the rules of the New York Convention (to which Norway has acceded).

###### Finland

Pursuant to the provisions of the Recast Brussels Regulation, which apply to proceedings instituted, and
judgments issued, from January 10, 2015, a judgment issued in the courts of a Member State which is
enforceable in that Member State, will be directly enforceable in Finland in accordance with the provisions of
the Regulation provided that the formal requirements in the Regulation are satisfied.

Under the 2007 Lugano Convention on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil
and commercial matters, a judgment issued in the courts of Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, or a member state of
the European Union which is enforceable in that contracting state, will be enforceable in Finland upon the
fulfilment of the following requirements: (a) a motion for enforcement has been granted by the competent
Finnish district court, and (b) the formal requirements set out in the Lugano Convention have been fulfilled.

Pursuant to the provisions of the Hague Convention on choice of court agreements, judgements issued by courts
in Mexico, Montenegro, Singapore, and the United Kingdom, that are based on exclusive choice of court
agreement concluded in civil or commercial matters will, provided that such judgement has effect and is
enforceable in the country of origin, be recognized or enforceable in Finland in accordance with, and subject to
the exceptions and limitations of, the Hague Convention. The Hague Convention is applicable to exclusive
choice of court agreements concluded after its entry into force for the state of the chosen court. The United
Kingdom acceded to the Hague Convention individually on January 1, 2021 and prior to this, was a party by
virtue of its membership of the EU; it is an unresolved question whether the Hague Convention would apply to
choice of court agreements choosing UK courts concluded before January 1, 2021.

Foreign arbitral awards are enforceable in Finland pursuant to the New York Convention.

32


-----

Judgments issued in the courts of a state with which there is no legal instrument for the recognition and
enforcement of judgments are not recognized or enforceable in Finland. As there is no treaty on the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters
between the United States and Finland, courts in Finland will not automatically recognize and enforce a final
judgment rendered by a U.S. court. Under Finnish law, a Finnish title for execution (i.e., a Finnish court
judgment) is required for such recognition and enforcement; in seeking a Finnish court judgment or order to
such effect, a judgment of a U.S. court will constitute circumstantial evidence of the questions of fact in the
case concerned and evidence of the governing law as applied to the matter in dispute.

As to types of damages awarded, punitive or exemplary damages are unenforceable under Finnish law and a
Finnish court may only award damages to the extent that they form compensation of actual losses and damages
as proven by the claimant. A feature of the Finnish civil procedure is that the burden of proof with respect to
any claims presented lies, with certain rare exceptions, with the claimant.

A party to legal proceedings in Finland is also ordinarily expected to plead its case primarily on the basis of the
evidence in its own possession. U.S. notions of discovery, including the expectation that broadly defined
categories of documents and information in the possession of third parties will be readily accessible for use as
evidence, are not recognized under Finnish law. The availability of documentation in the possession of
counterparties or third parties is limited, and a party seeking to obtain such documents is required to be able to
specify such documents with relative precision. Depositions are also a form of taking evidence unknown to
Finnish law. In Finland, witness testimony is usually only taken at a separate oral main hearing (comparable to
a U.S. trial) after the preparatory phase of the proceedings.

Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, restructuring, insolvency, reorganization
or moratorium as well as other similar mandatory laws affecting creditor’s rights generally.

  KPMG!
      Independent Auditor’s report
         To the Board of Directors of Assemblin Group AB (publ), corporate identity number 559077-5952
       Report on the consolidated financial statements
        Opinion
        We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Assemblin Group AB (publ) and its subsidiaries (“the
        Group”) for the period of three years ended 31 December 2022. The consolidated financial statements of the Group
         are included on pages F-1 to F-55 in this document.
           In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements have been prepared and present fairly, in all material respects,
         the financial position of the Group as of the 31 December 2022, 31 December 2021, and 31 December 2020 and
         their financial performance and cash flow for each of the three financial years ending the 31 December 2022 in
        accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU.
        Basis for Opinion
        We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA) and generally accepted
         auditing standards in Sweden. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's
        Responsibilities section. We are independent of the Group in accordance with professional ethics for accountants
           in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
        We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
        Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer
        The Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated
         financial statements and that they give a fair presentation in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU. The
        Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer are also responsible for such internal control as they determine
            is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material
        misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
           In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer are
        responsible for the assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. They disclose, as applicable,
        matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis of
        accounting is however not applied if the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer intends to liquidate the
         Group, to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
        Auditor’s responsibility
        Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole
          are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes
         our opinions. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted
           in accordance with ISAs and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect a material
        misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually
          or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the
         basis of these consolidated financial statements.
         As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional
        skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

  KPMG
         — Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
             due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit
            evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. The risk of not detecting a
             material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve
              collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentation, or the override of internal control.
         — Obtain an understanding of the Group’s internal control relevant to our audit in order to design audit
            procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on
              the effectiveness of the internal control.
         — Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
             and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer.
         — Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ and the Chief Executive Officer's use of the
             going concern basis of accounting in preparing the consolidated financial statements. We also draw a
             conclusion, based on the audit evidence obtained, as to whether any material uncertainty exists related to
             events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
                    If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report
                 to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate,
                to modify our opinion about the consolidated financial statements. Our conclusions are based on the audit
            evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause
                 a Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
         — Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including
              the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions
             and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
         — Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or
            business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We
              are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely
            responsible for our opinions.
        We must inform the Board of Directors of, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit. We
        must also inform of significant audit findings during our audit, including any significant deficiencies in internal control
         that we identified.

###### Note 1 – Significant accounting policies

**Basis of preparation**

These consolidated financial statements for the financial years 2022, 2021 and 2020 have been prepared for a purpose of inclusion
in an offering memorandum, since the parent company Apollo Swedish Bidco AB intend to issue a bond that is planned to be listed
on a regulated market (the International Stock Exchange). The financial statements of Assemblin Group (“the Group”) include
Assemblin Group AB (publ) (559077-5952) and its subsidiaries. A complete register of the entities that constitute the Group is
presented in the consolidated financial statements, see Note 30.

**Statement of compliance**

The consolidated financial statements for the years 2022, 2021 and 2020 have been prepared in accordance with the International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU.

The consolidated financial statements for the years 2022, 2021 and 2020 were approved for issue by the Board of Directors on
31 May 2023.

Unless otherwise indicated, the amounts in the report are in SEK million rounded to the nearest million, which may result in
rounding difference.

**Measurement policies used when preparing the financial statements**

Assets and liabilities are recognized at historical cost, except for certain financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair
value. Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value consist of unlisted shares and participations, contingent consideration
as well as derivatives.

**Functional currency and reporting currency**

The parent company’s functional currency is the Swedish krona, which also constitutes the reporting currency for the Group. This
means that the financial statements are presented in Swedish kronor. All amounts are rounded to the nearest million, unless
otherwise indicated.

**Judgements and estimates in the financial statements**

Preparing the financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires company management to make estimates, assessments and
assumptions affecting the application of the accounting policies and the carrying amounts for assets, liabilities, revenues and costs.
Actual outcomes may deviate from the estimates and assumptions that have been made.

The estimates and assumptions are reviewed on a regular basis. Changes to estimates are recognized in the period the change is
made, if the change only affected that period, or in the period the change is made and future periods if the change affects both
the period in question and future periods.

Judgements made by company management when applying IFRS that have significant impact on the financial statements, and
estimates made that could entail significant adjustments in the financial statements for the following year, are described in more
detail in Note 31.

**Amended accounting policies attributable to new or amended IFRS**

Amendments with regard to IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets are applied as of 1 January 2022. With
regard to provisions, the costs to be included when reporting onerous contracts are clarified, and it did not have any significant
impact on Assemblin’s financial statements, as Assemblin already includes certain indirect costs attributable to individual projects
in its provisions for onerous contracts.

Standards or interpretations applied as of 1 January 2022 are not deemed to have had a significant impact on the Group’s financial
statements.

**New or amended accounting policies yet to be applied by the Group**

A number of new standards and interpretations will enter into force for financial years commencing after 1 January 2023 and have
yet to be applied in the preparation of this financial report. Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IFRS
Practice Statement 2: Disclosures of accounting policies, Amendment of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements regarding
“Non-current liabilities with Covenants” and the separation between current and non-current may have an impact on the Group’s

accounting principles, presentation and disclosures. Other new standards and interpretations issued by the IASB are not expected
to have any significant effect on the Group’s financial statements.

F-7


-----

**Classification**

All non-current assets comprise amounts expected to be recovered more than 12 months after the balance sheet date. Noncurrent liabilities essentially comprise amounts expected to be paid more than 12 months after the balance sheet date, as well as
payments that the Company has an unconditional right to defer until a point in time 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Current assets and current liabilities essentially consist of amounts that are expected to be recovered or settled within 12 months
of the balance sheet date.

**Operating segments**

Operating segments are reported in accordance with the internal reporting to Group Management (the highest executive decisionmaker). Group management is responsible for allocating resources to the operating segments and evaluating their financial
performance and is also the body that makes strategic decisions. The Group’s operating segments are Assemblin Electrical,
Assemblin H&S (Heating & Sanitation), Assemblin Ventilation, Assemblin Norway and Assemblin Finland. Refer to Note 3 for
additional descriptions of the divisions, and the presentation of the operating segments.

**Consolidation principles and business combinations**

Subsidiaries are companies over which the Group exerts a controlling interest. A controlling influence exists when the Group is
exposed to or is entitled to variable returns from its holdings in the company and can affect the return through its controlling
influence over the Company.

Acquisitions are recognized applying the acquisition method. The Assemblin Group recognizes acquired identifiable assets and
liabilities at fair value. The acquisition analysis establishes the fair value, on the acquisition date, of identifiable assets acquired
and liabilities assumed, as well as any holdings with a non-controlling interest. All acquisition-related expenses are expensed.

The amount by which purchase considerations and any holdings without a controlling interest (plus the fair value of previously
held participations, in conjunction with staggered acquisitions) exceed the fair value of the acquired net assets is recognized as
goodwill. When the difference is negative (bargain purchase), this is recognized directly in profit or loss for the year.

Purchase considerations do not include payments pertaining to the settlement of former business relationships. These types of
settlement are usually recognized in earnings.

Contingent considerations are measured at fair value at the acquisition date. In cases where the contingent consideration is
classified as an equity instrument, no restatement is performed, and settlement is made within equity. Other contingent
considerations recognized as liabilities are restated as per each reporting date, with the change being recognized in profit for the
year.

**Transactions eliminated in consolidation**

Intra-Group receivables and liabilities, revenue or costs and unrealized profit or loss that arise from intra-Group transactions are
eliminated entirely in preparing the financial statements. Unrealized profits arising from transactions with joint ventures are
eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group’s ownership share in the company. Unrealized losses are eliminated
in the same manner as unrealized profits, but only to the extent there is no impairment requirement.

**Joint ventures**

In the accounts, joint ventures are those companies for which the Group, through partnership agreements with one or more
parties, has a joint controlling interest in which the Group has the right to net assets instead of a direct right to assets and
commitments in liabilities. Holdings in joint ventures are consolidated in the financial statements in accordance with the equity
method.

**Equity method**

The equity method means that in the Group, the carrying amount of the shares in joint ventures corresponds to the Group’s share
of equity in joint ventures. The Group’s participation in the earnings of joint ventures is recognized in profit for the year. These
shares of profits constitute the primary change in the carrying amount of shares in joint ventures.

Acquisition-related expenses that arise are included in the cost. The equity method is applied from the date on which the joint
controlling influence is obtained until the time when the joint controlling influence ceases.

**Translation of foreign currency**

**_Transactions in foreign currency_**

F-8


-----

Transactions in foreign currency are restated in the functional currency at the exchange rate in effect on the transaction date.
Functional currency is the currency in which the primary financial environments where the companies conduct their operations.
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency are restated in the functional currency at the exchange rate in effect on the
balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising in the translations are recognized in profit or loss. Non-monetary assets and
liabilities recognized at historical cost are restated at the exchange rate on the transaction date. Non-monetary assets and
liabilities measured at fair value are restated in the functional currency at the exchange rate in effect on the date of measurement
at fair value.

**Financial reports from foreign operations**

Assets and liabilities in the Group’s foreign operations, including goodwill and other Group-related surpluses and deficits, are
translated from the functional currency of the foreign operations into the Group’s reporting currency at the exchange rate at the
balance-sheet date. Non-current loans to subsidiaries designated, by the parent, as part of its net investment in the foreign
operation are treated as equity for translational purposes with the differences being recognized in comprehensive income.
Revenue and expenses in operations abroad are restated in Swedish kronor at an average rate that constituted an approximation
of the exchange rates that were in effect on the respective transaction dates. Translation differences arising in connection with
currency translations are recognized in Other comprehensive income, and are accumulated in a separate component in equity,
designated as translation reserves. When a controlling influence or joint controlling influence in foreign operations ceases, the
accumulated translation differences are realized through a transfer from the translation reserve in equity to profit for the year. In
the event a sale occurs but controlling interest remains, a proportional share of accumulated translation differences from the
translation reserve is transferred to holdings with a non-controlling interest. In the event of a sale of portions of joint ventures
where a joint controlling interest remains, a proportional share of the translation differences are reclassified to profit or loss.

**Revenue**

The Group’s revenue consists primarily of revenue from construction and service assignments. Revenue recognition for
construction and service assignments take place as control is transferred to the customer. The construction assignments mean
that the Group designs and installs technical systems for electrical, heating, sanitation and ventilation in customers’ offices, arenas,
shopping centers, homes and industrial premises. The Group creates an asset over which the customer gains control in pace with
the asset being completed. This means that revenue from construction assignments is reported over time. For service assignments
such as maintenance and operational work, the customer benefits in pace with the services being performed, meaning that these
revenues are also reported over time.

_Installation assignments_

For fixed-price agreements, revenue is recognized based on the assignment expenditures incurred in relation to the total
estimated assignment expenditures. Since there is a direct relationship between the expenses incurred by the Group for its
assignments and the transfer to customers of the benefits, this method is considered to accurately measure the degree to which
the performance obligation is fulfilled. Costs attributable to construction assignments are recognized in profit or loss when
incurred. Most of the Group’s construction contracts are subject to fixed-price agreements, with variable compensation in only a
few exceptional cases. Changes to agreements related to remodeling or supplementary work are recognized to the extent they
have been agreed with the customer. Claims and incentive compensation are included in the project revenue only to the extent
that it is highly unlikely that a significant reversal of accumulated reported revenue will occur.

Payment is usually received in stages during the completion of a contracting agreement and payment is usually received before
the relevant stage commences. In some contracting assignments, however, payment is received following the relevant stage. If
the services provided by the Group exceed invoiced amounts (after deductions for any reported losses), a contractual asset is
reported. Partially invoiced amounts that have not yet been settled by the customer, and amounts held by the client are included
in Trade receivables. If invoicing exceeds the services delivered (after deduction of any reported losses), a contractual liability is
reported.

A fundamental condition for recognizing revenue over time is that the outcome can reasonably be measured against completion
of the performance obligation. If it is not reasonably possible to measure the outcome of a project reliably, the income is reported
at the corresponding amount as the accrued expense, that is, no earnings are recognized while awaiting the determination of the
earnings. Reporting revenue in pace with completion contains a component of uncertainty. Unforeseen events sometimes occur
resulting in earnings that are higher or lower than originally expected. If circumstances change, estimates regarding revenue,
expenses or the degree of completion are revised. Increases or decreases in estimated revenue or expenses attributable to revised
estimates are reported in profit or loss in the period in which the circumstances that gave rise to the audit became known to
management.

If likely that the estimated project expenses in a contracting agreement will exceed the estimated project revenues, the expected
loss is immediately reported in its entirety as a cost. The Group’s commitment to rectify errors and deficiencies in completed

F-9


-----

projects in accordance with normal guarantee rules is reported as a provision in the statement of financial position and as an
expense in profit or loss.

_Service assignments_

As regards service assignments, revenue and the appurtenant costs are recognized over time (that is, in pace with Assemblin
performing the service). For agreements at a fixed price, revenue is reported based on the proportion of the total agreed service
delivered during the period. This is determined based on the assignment expenditures incurred in relation to the total estimated
assignment expenditures. Since there is a direct relationship between the expenses incurred by the Group for its assignments and
the transfer to customers of the benefits, this method is considered to accurately measure the degree to which the performance
commitment is fulfilled. For contracts on a current account where the Group is entitled to compensation in relation to the value
of fulfilled commitments, revenue is reported to the extent that the Group is entitled to invoice. In cases where invoicing takes
place in arrears, a contractual asset is reported. In cases where payment is made in advance regarding service contracts, a
contractual liability is reported.

_Significant financing components_

The Group has no agreements according to which the time between the handover of services or contracts to the customer and
the payment from the customer exceeds one year. As a result, the Group does not adjust the transaction price for the effects of a
significant financing component.

**Financial income and expenses**

Financial income consists of interest income on invested funds, dividend income, gains on changes in value of financial assets
measured at fair value through profit or loss, and exchange rate gains.

Dividend income is recognized when the right to receive dividends has been established.

Financial expenses consist of interest charged on loans, and the effect of unwinding the present value of provisions, and exchange
rate losses.

Interest income on receivables and interest expenses on liabilities are calculated using the effective interest method. The effective
interest rate is the interest rate that makes the present value of all estimated future inflows and outflows during the expected
term equal to the carrying amount of the receivable or liability. Foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized net. Exchange
rate changes regarding operating receivables and liabilities are reported in operating profit, while exchange rate changes regarding
financial receivables and liabilities are reported in net financial items.

**Tax**

Income tax consists of current tax and deferred tax. Income tax is recognized in profit or loss, except when underlying transactions
were recognized in other comprehensive income or in equity, whereupon the appurtenant tax effect is recognized in other
comprehensive income or in equity respectively.

Current tax is tax that is to be paid or received as regards the current year, with application of the tax rates determined in fact or
in practice on the balance sheet date. Adjustment of current tax attributable to earlier periods also belongs to current tax.

Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the recognized and taxable values of assets and liabilities, as well
as on tax deficits. Deferred tax liabilities attributable to temporary differences regarding participations in subsidiaries are not
reported in cases where the Assemblin Group can control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is unlikely
that they will be reversed within the foreseeable future. Measurement of deferred tax is based on how the underlying assets or
liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. Deferred tax is calculated applying tax rates and tax regulations determined, or
essentially determined, as of the balance sheet date and that are expected to apply when the relevant deferred tax asset is realized
or the deferred tax liability is settled.

Deferred tax assets are reported if it is likely that these will be utilized against future taxable surpluses. The value of deferred tax
assets is reduced when it is no longer deemed likely that they can be utilized.

Any future income tax that arises in connection with a dividend is reported on the same date as when the dividend is recognized
as a liability.

**Financial assets and financial liabilities: Financial instruments**

**_Accounting and initial measurement_**

F-10


-----

Accounts receivable are reported when issued. Other financial assets and liabilities are reported when the Group becomes a party
to the contractual terms of the instrument.

Financial instruments are initially measured at fair value with additions and deductions for transaction expenses except those
regarding instruments continuously measured at fair value through profit or loss. For these instruments, transaction expenses are
instead expensed as they are incurred. Accounts receivable are initially valued at the transaction price determined in accordance
with the revenue recognition principles (see above).

**_Classification of financial assets_**

The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories:

– financial assets reported at amortized cost, and

– financial assets reported at fair value either via the income statement or via other comprehensive income.

The classification is attributable to the Group’s business model for managing financial assets and the contractual terms of the
assets’ cash flows. Financial assets are only reclassified in cases where the Group’s business model for the instruments changes.
A summary of the classifications of the Group’s financial instruments is presented in Note 20.

**_Subsequent measurement of financial assets_**

Subsequent measurement depends on the Group’s business model for managing of the asset and the type of cash flows to which
the asset gives.

_Amortized cost_

Assets held with the purpose of collecting contractual cash flows where such cash flows solely comprise principal and interest, are
reported at amortized cost, applying the effective interest method. Impairment losses are reported on the Cost of production line
in income statement. All of the Group’s financial assets, except for holdings of unlisted shares and participations and derivatives,
are measured at amortized cost.

_Fair value through other comprehensive income_

The Group measures holdings of unlisted shares and participations at fair value through other comprehensive income. No
subsequent reclassification of fair value changes is made in profit or loss when the instrument is removed from the statement of
financial position. Impairment losses (and reversals of impairment losses) are not reported separately from other changes in fair
value. Dividends are reported in profit or loss as financial income when the Group’s right to receive payment has been determined.

Derivatives with a positive fair value are recognized as derivative assets; refer further to “Hedge accounting”.

**_Derivatives and Hedge accounting_**

The Group holds financial derivatives to hedge transactions foreign currency. Derivatives are recognized in the statement of
financial position as per the transaction date and measured at fair value, both initially and on subsequent remeasurement at the
end of each reporting period. The method of recognizing the gain or loss arising on remeasurement depends on whether the
derivative is recognized as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.

The Group identifies derivatives as hedges of certain risks attributable to the cash flow from a recognized asset, liability or highly
likely projected transaction (cash flow hedging).

On entering into the transaction, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item,
as well as the Group’s risk management objectives and risk management strategy regarding the hedging. The Group also
documents its assessment, both on entering into the hedge and thereafter, of whether the derivative instruments used in hedging
transactions have been, and will continue to be, effective in counteracting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the
hedged items.

Information on the fair value of derivative instruments used for hedging purposes can be found in Note 18. The fair value of a
derivative that is a hedging instrument is classified as a non-current asset or non-current liability when the remaining term of the
hedged item exceeds 12 months, and as a current asset or current liability when the outstanding term of the hedged item is less
than 12 months.

**_Derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting_**

All of the Group’s derivatives meet the requirements for hedge accounting.

**_Cash flow hedges_**

F-11


-----

When a derivative is identified as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the derivative
is recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedge reserve in equity. The effective portion of the changes
in fair value in the derivative recognized in other comprehensive income is limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the
hedged item, determined on a present value basis, from the start of the hedge. Ineffective portions of changes in fair value in the
derivative are recognized immediately in earnings.

For the hedged forecast transactions, the accumulated amount in the hedge reserve is reclassified to earnings in the same
period(s) that the hedged anticipated cash flow impacts earnings.

If the hedged cash flow is no longer expected to arise, the amount that has accumulated in the hedge reserve is immediately
reclassified to earnings.

**_Classification and subsequent measurement of financial liabilities_**

All financial liabilities except derivatives and contingent purchase considerations, are recognized at amortized cost. Any difference
between the amount received (net after transaction costs) and the repayment amount allocated over the period of the loan using
the effective interest-rate method. Financial liabilities are classified as current liabilities if the Group has an unconditional right to
defer payment of the liability for at least 12 months following the end of the reporting period.

Derivatives with a positive fair value are recognized as derivative liabilities, see further under the section “Derivatives and hedge
accounting”.

**_Derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities_**

A financial asset is derecognized from the statement of financial position when the contractual rights to the cash flow from the
financial asset expire, or if Assemblin Group transfers the right to receive the contractual cash flows through a transaction in which
essentially all risks and benefits are transferred to the counterparty.

The Group derecognizes a financial liability from the statement of financial position when the commitments indicated in the
agreement have been extinguished or annulled, or expire. The Group also derecognizes a financial liability when the terms of the
contract are modified and the cash flows from the modified liability are materially different. In this case, a new financial liability
is measured at fair value based on the modified conditions.

**_Offsetting_**

A financial asset and a financial liability are offset and recognized with a net amount in the statement of financial position only
when the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts, and intends to settle the items with a net amount or to simultaneously
realize the asset and settle the liability.

**_Impairment of financial assets_**

Financial assets reported at amortized cost and subject to impairment relate mainly to accounts receivable and contractual assets.
The Group applies the simplified method when calculating expected credit losses.

The simplification means that reserves are set aside for an amount corresponding to expected credit losses during the entire term
of the receivable. The reserve is taken into account on initial recognition and is then revalued during the term of the receivable.

Contractual assets are attributable to work that has not yet been invoiced and bear essentially the same risk characteristics as
work invoiced for the same type of contract. The Group therefore considers that the loss levels for accounts receivable are a
reasonable estimate of the loss levels for contractual assets.

Calculation of expected credit losses is primarily based on information about historical losses for similar receivables and
counterparties. Historical losses are then adjusted to take into account current and forward-looking information that may affect
customers’ ability to pay the claim.

**Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are recognized in the Group at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment. The cost
includes the purchase price and expenditures directly attributable to the asset for bringing it on site and in usable condition in
accordance with the purpose for which it was procured.

**_Additional expenses_**

Subsequent expenditures are added to the cost only if it is likely that the future economic benefits associated with the asset will
flow to the company and if the cost can be reliably calculated. All other subsequent expenditures are recognized as costs in the
period they arise. A subsequent expenditure is added to the cost if the expenditure relates to the replacement of identified

F-12


-----

components or parts thereof. Even in cases where new components are created, the expenditure is added to the cost. Any
unimpaired carrying amounts on replaced components or parts of components are disposed of and expensed conjunction with
replacement. Repairs are expensed on a running basis.

**_Depreciation policies_**

Depreciation occurs on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset; land is not impaired.

_Estimated useful life:_

— machinery and other technical assets, 5–12 years
— furniture, tools, fixtures and fittings 5–10 years
— expenses for improvements to the property of others are depreciated across the term of the contract

The depreciation methods applied, residual values and useful lives are reassessed at the end of every year.

**Leased assets**

When an agreement is signed, the Group judges whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if
it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Group mainly
leases premises and vehicles. Leases are recognized as rights of use and a corresponding liability as of the date the leased asset is
available for use by the Group. The lease liability is initially reported at the present value of the remaining lease fees during the
term of the lease, amounts expected to be paid out in accordance with any residual value guarantees, the price of call options if
the Group expects these to be exercised and any penalties for terminating an agreement if the Group deems it reasonable that
the agreement will be terminated. Lease expenses include fixed expenses and variable lease payments that depend on an index
or a rate. Agreements can contain both lease and non-lease components. Payments for non-lease components have been excluded
from the calculation of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which consists of the initial value of
the lease liability plus lease expenses paid on or before the commencement date and any initial direct expenses. The right-of-use
asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the asset
and the end of the lease term, which, for the Group, is normally the end of the leasing period. In the rarer cases, in which the cost
of the right-of-use asset reflects the Group exercising an option to purchase the underlying asset, the asset is depreciated until
the end of its useful life.

The term of the lease comprises the agreement’s non-cancellable period, with the addition of further periods in the contract if,
on the commencement date, it is deemed reasonably certain that these will be exercised. When the lease’s length is determined,
all available information is taken into account that provides a financial incentive to use an extension option, or to not use an option
to terminate an agreement. Opportunities to extend an agreement are only included in the length of the leasing agreement if it is
reasonably certain that the agreement will be extended (or not terminated). Most of the extension options relating to the leasing
of premises and vehicles have not been included in the lease liability as the Group can replace the assets without significant
expenses or interruptions in operations and does not consider that it is reasonably certain that the options will be exercised.

The values of the liability and the asset are adjusted in conjunction with a reassessment of the lease term. This occurs in
conjunction with the passing of the final cancellation date in a previously assessed lease term, or alternately when significant
events take place or when circumstances have changed significantly within the control of the Group and impact the existing
assessment of the lease term.

Lease payments have been discounted by the incremental borrowing rate as regards leased premises, and by the implicit interest
rate as regards vehicles. To determine the marginal lending rate, if possible, financing recently received by a third party is used as
a starting point. If no loans from third parties exist in the near future, a method is used that is based on a risk-free interest rate
that is adjusted for credit risk. Adjustments are made for the specific terms of the agreement, e.g. term of the lease, country and
currency.

The Group is exposed to any future increases of variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate that are not included
in the lease liability before they enter force. When adjustments of lease payments that depend on an index or a rate enter force,
the lease liability is restated against the right-of-use asset.

Lease payments are divided between repayment of the liability and interest. Interest is recognized in the statement of earnings
and the statement of comprehensive income over the term of the lease. Right of use assets are normally depreciated on a straightline basis over the shorter of the useful life and the lease term. Payments for agreements of less than one year and low-value
leases are expensed on a straight-line basis in the statement of earnings and the statement of comprehensive income.

**Intangible assets**

**_Goodwill_**

F-13


-----

Goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment. Goodwill arising from business combinations is allocated to cashgenerating units or groups of units that are expected to benefit from the business combination. Goodwill is tested for impairment
annually or more frequently if events or altered circumstances indicate a possible impairment. Each unit or group of units to which
goodwill has been allocated corresponds to the lowest level in the Group at which the goodwill in question is monitored in the
internal control, which, for the Group, is the operating segment level.

**_Other intangible assets_**

Other intangible assets include the order backlog, brands and capitalized development expenses. Other intangible assets, with the
exception of brands, are recognized at cost less accumulated amortization (see below) and any impairment. Brands are judged to
have an indefinite useful life.

Brands are tested for impairment annually and as soon as there are any indication that the asset in question having decreased in
value.

**_Amortization policies_**

Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets, provided that such
useful lives are not indefinite. The useful lives are reviewed at least yearly. Goodwill and other intangible assets that are not yet
ready for use, are reviewed for impairment requirements on a yearly basis and additionally as soon as indications arise showing
that the asset in question has decreased in value. Intangible assets with determinate useful lives are amortized from the date they
are available for use.

_The estimated useful lives are:_

— order backlog 1–2 years
— capitalized development expenditure 3–5 years

**Impairment of non-financial assets**

The Group’s recognized assets are assessed on every balance sheet date to determine if there are indicators of impairment
requirements.

If there is an indicator of impairment, the recoverable amount of the asset is calculated (see below). For goodwill and brands with
indeterminate useful lives and intangible assets not yet ready for use, the recoverable amount is calculated annually. If materially
independent cash flows cannot be determined for an individual asset, and its fair value less the cost to sell cannot be used, the
assets are grouped for impairment requirements at the lowest level where it is possible to identify materially independent cash
flows; this is known as a cash-generating unit.

An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (group of units) exceeds the
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognized as a cost in profit or loss for the year. When an impairment requirement is
identified for a cash-generating unit (group of units), the impairment amount is allocated first to goodwill. Subsequently, a
proportional impairment is made of other assets included in the unit (group of units).

The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less the cost to sell and value-in-use. In calculating value-in-use, future cash
flows are discounted by a discount factor that takes into account the risk-free interest rate and the risk associated with the specific
asset.

**_Reversal of impairment losses_**

An impairment of assets is reversed if there is both an indication that impairment no longer exists, and a change has occurred in
the assumptions that formed the basis for calculating the recoverable amount. Goodwill impairment, however, is never reversed.
A reversal only occurs to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset after reversal does not exceed the carrying amount that
would have been recognized, less amortization where appropriate, if no impairment had occurred.

**Payment of capital to owners**

**_Dividends_**

Dividends are recognized as a liability after the Annual General Meeting has approved the dividend.

**Earnings per share**

The calculation of earnings per share is based on the Group’s profit for the period attributable to the Parent Company’s
shareholders and on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period.

F-14


-----

**Employee benefits**

**_Short-term benefits_**

Short-term employee benefits are calculated without discount and recognized as an expense when the related services are
received.

A provision is recognized for the anticipated bonus payments when the Group has a valid legal or informal obligation to make such
payments as a result of services being received from employees and the obligation can be reliably calculated.

**_Post-employment benefits_**

In defined contribution plans, the company pays fixed fees to a separate legal entity, and has no obligation to pay additional fees.
The Group’s earnings are expensed for costs in pace with the benefits being vested.

Defined-benefit plans are other plans for post-employment benefits than defined-contribution plans. The Group’s net obligation
regarding defined-benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan through an estimate of the future benefits the employee
has earned through their employment in both current and previous periods. The Group bears the risk for the plan providing the
benefits offered.

In the statement of financial position, the estimated present value of the liabilities is reported as a provision as the Group only
has unfunded pension plans.

The pension cost and pension obligation for defined benefit pension plans are calculated annually by independent actuaries. The
discount rate corresponds to the interest rate as per the balance-sheet date on mortgage bonds, with a tenor that corresponds to
the Group’s pension obligations. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. Net
interest expenses on the defined-benefit obligation are recognized in the profit or loss under net financial items. The interest rate
is the interest rate that arises when discounting the obligation. Other components are recognized in operating profit. Revaluation
effects consist of actuarial gains and losses. The effects of remeasurement are recognized in other comprehensive income.

Changes to or reductions in a defined benefit plan are recognized at the earliest of the following:

a) when the change or reduction in the plan occurs; or
b) when the company recognizes related restructuring costs and termination benefits.

The changes and reductions are recognized directly in profit or loss for the year.

The special employer’s contributions constitute a part of the actuarial assumptions and are therefore recognized as part of the
obligation. For reasons of simplification, the part of the special employer’s contribution in a legal entity that is calculated based
on the Pension Obligations Vesting Act is recognized as an accrued cost instead of as a part of the net obligation.

Tax on returns is recognized on an ongoing basis in the income statement for the period the tax relates to, and is therefore not
included in the liability calculation.

**_Termination benefits_**

A cost for benefits in connection with termination of personnel is recognized when the company can no longer withdraw the offer
to the employee or when the company recognizes costs for restructuring, whichever is earlier. The benefits that are expected to
be settled after 12 months are recognized at their present value. Benefits that are not expected to be fully settled within 12
months are recognized under non-current benefits.

**Inventories**

Inventories are stated at cost or net realizable value, whichever is lower. Cost is calculated according to the first-in-first-out
principle.

**Provisions**

A provision is distinguished from other liabilities in that there is uncertainty around the payment date or the amount to settle the
provision. A provision is recognized in the statement of financial position when there is a legal or informal obligation, as a result
of an event that has occurred, it is probable that an outflow of financial resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the
amount can be reliably estimated.

Provisions are made with the amount that is the best estimation of what will be required to settle the existing obligation the
balance-sheet date. Where the effect of the timing of the payment is substantial, provisions are calculated through discounting

F-15


-----

the anticipated future cash flow at an interest rate before tax that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of
the money and, if appropriate, the risks associated with the liability.

**_Warranties_**

Warranty provisions are reported for warranty commitments under which Assemblin Group is obliged to remedy any deficiencies
in work performed or materials used within a certain time frame following the completion of the work. The provision is based on
historical warranty data and a comparison of potential outcomes in relation to the likelihoods associated with each outcome.

**_Restructuring_**

A provision for restructuring is recognized when there is an established, detailed and formal restructuring plan and the
restructuring has either begun or been publicly announced. No provision is made for future operating costs.

**_Onerous leases_**

A provision for onerous leases is recognized when the anticipated benefits that the Group expects to receive from a contract are
lower than the inevitable costs for fulfilling the obligations under the contract.

When assessing whether a feared loss exists, estimated project revenues are compared with the estimated project expenditures.

Estimated project expenses include:

– Expenditure directly related to the individual assignment,

– Indirect expenditure that can be allocated to the individual assignment, and

– Other expenses that, in accordance with the agreement, can be charged to the customer.

Expenses that cannot be attributed to individual assignments are not included in project expenses. Such expenses include:

– General administrative expenses, except in cases where compensation for these is to be paid in accordance with the
agreement

– Sales expenses

– Research and development expenses, except in cases where compensation for these is to be paid in accordance with the
agreement

– Depreciation of machinery and equipment not used on the project.

**Contingent liabilities**

Disclosure of a contingent liability is submitted when there is a possible obligation, attributable to past events, whose existence is
confirmed only by one or more uncertain future events outside the Group’s control or when there is an obligation that is not
recognized as a liability or provision owing to the fact that it is not likely an outflow of resources will be required or cannot be
calculated with sufficient reliability.

Fulfilment warranties in the form of Parent Company warranties normally comprise 10 percent of the contract sum until the
contract has been handed over to the customer. The handover normally takes place in connection with a final inspection, on
approval. If the warranty covers all or most of the contract sum, the amount of the contingency is calculated as the contract sum
less the value of the portion performed. In cases where the warranty covers only a smaller part of the contract sum, the amount
of the guarantee is carried as an unchanged amount up until the contract is surrendered to the client. These contingent liabilities
are disclosed for the Parent Company.

In cases where a bank or insurance institution issues a completion guarantee to a customer in connection with a contract, these
normally receive, in turn, a counter-commitment from the contracting company or another Group company. Such counter
obligations relating to own contracts are not recognized as contingencies, since they contain no increased responsibility compared
with the contract commitment.

###### Note 3 – Operating segments

The Group’s operating segments are based primarily on the main operational orientation the segments have. The following five
operating segments have been identified:

— Assemblin Electrical — offers comprehensive solutions for planning, installation, service and maintenance in electricity and
automation. The operations also cover services in security and industrial servicing. A portion of production takes place in the
company’s proprietary electrical power stations.

— Assemblin H&S (Heating & sanitation) — designs, installs and maintains technical systems for heating, sanitation, sprinklers,
industry, energy and cooling in all types of buildings.

— Assemblin Ventilation — specialists in construction, installation, service and maintenance of energy-smart ventilation
facilities.

— Assemblin Norway — possesses a high degree of competency in primarily electrical, heating and sanitation, and automation.
— Assemblin Finland — operations offer services in electricity, ventilation, heating and sanitation, and in automation and energy
efficiency as well.

These segments are the primary divisions that the company’s chief operating decision maker (CEO) reviews in regards to earnings,
capital requirements and cash flows. The company´s CEO evaluates the segments’ results on adjusted EBITA.

Each operating segment has a director who is responsible for the operating activities and reports the outcome from the segment
to CEO.

The earnings, assets and liabilities of the operating segments have included directly attributable items, as well as items that can
reasonably and reliably be allocated to the segments. The internal price among the Group’s various segments is set under the
“arm’s length” principle (i.e. between parties that are independent of each other, well-informed and with a shared interest in
performing the transactions).

**Overview of defined benefit plans**

The Group has a defined benefit plan that provides remuneration to employees when they retire. The plan relates only to
Sweden. The defined benefit plan is exposed to actuarial risks such as life expectancy, currency, interest rate and investment
risks. The plan is preliminary attributable to men. Payments to the plan are expected to total SEK 18.7 million (2021: 16, 2020:
14.5) over the next few years.

**_Assumptions for defined benefit obligations_** 2022 2021 2020

Discount rate as of 31 December 4.00% 1.80% 1.10%

Future salary growth 2.60% 2.70% 2.00%

Inflation 2.10% 2.20% 1.50%

The life expectancy assumption is based on published statistics and mortality rates. The current life expectancy on which the
obligation is calculated is based on DUS21 (2021: DUS14, 2020: DUS14). The remaining life expectancy for a 65-year-old woman
with this life expectancy assumption is 23.9 years (2021: 24, 2020: 24) and 21.8 years (2021: 22, 2020: 22) for a man. The total
current life expectancy on which the obligation is calculated is 16 years (2021: 19, 2020:19) to establish a discount rate of 4.00
percent (2021: 1.80, 2020: 1.10).

**Sensitivity analysis**

The table below presents possible changes to actuarial assumptions as at the period end, other assumptions unchanged, and how
these would affect the defined benefit obligation.

**Alecta**

For salaried employees in Sweden, the defined benefit pension obligations in the ITP-2 plan for retirement and family pensions
are secured through insurance with Alecta. According to a statement from the Swedish Financial Reporting Board, this is a defined
benefit plan that covers several employees. For the financial year, the company did not have access to such information as would
make it possible to recognize this plan as a defined benefit plan. The pension plan under ITP secured through insurance with Alecta
is thus recognized as a defined contribution plan.

The premium for the defined benefit retirement and family pension is calculated individually and is based on such factors as the
salary, previously earned pension and expected remaining length of service. Expected contributions in the next reporting period
for ITP 2 insurance with Alecta amount to SEK 20.1 million (2021: 19.7, 2020: 25.4). The Group's share of the total contributions
to the pension scheme is 0.07% (2021: 0.05%, 2020: 0.07%), while its share of the total number of active members in the scheme
is 0.05% (2021: 0.05%, 2020: 0.06%).

Annual fees for pension insurance contracted with Alecta totals SEK 74.2 million (2021: 68.8, 2020: 59.3). Alecta’s surplus can be
allocated to policy holders and/or the insured. The collective consolidation level is normally allowed to vary between 125 and 175
percent. If Alecta's consolidation level falls below 125 percent or rises above 175 percent, measures must be taken to enable the
consolidation level to return to the normal range. In the event of low consolidation levels, one measure could be raising the
contracted price for new policies and expanding existing benefits. In the event of high consolidation levels, one measure could be
introducing premium reductions. The premiums to Alecta are calculated using assumptions regarding interest rates, life
expectancy, operating costs and tax on returns from pension funds, so that the payment of a consistent amount of premium up
to the date the date of retirement is sufficient to ensure the entire, targeted benefit, based on the insured’s current pensionable
salary, is, in fact earned. The collective consolidation level consists of the market value of Alecta’s actuarial calculations, which do
not correspond with IAS 19. At year end, Alecta’s surplus in the form of the collective consolidation level totaled 172 percent
(2021: 172, 2020: 148). There is no agreed framework to guide the process of managing any deficit that may arise. In the first
instance, losses will be covered by Alecta’s collective consolidation capital and will thus not lead to increased costs through higher
contractual premiums. Nor are there guidelines on how surplus of deficits should be allocated in the event of dissolution of the
scheme or a company´s withdrawal from the scheme.

assets of SEK 1 million (2021: 0, 2020: 12). Capitalized tax losses are attributable to Swedish and Finnish wholly owned subsidiaries.
Based on prepared forecasts and a very strong order book, it is the opinion of the Board of Directors that the remaining tax loss
will likely be settled against future taxable gains.

The amortization of Order backlog and Capitalized development costs is allocated to Sales and administrative expenses.

Capitalized development costs are internally generated intangibles.

**Impairment testing of cash generating units containing goodwill**

Assessing the value of the Group’s goodwill items and other intangible assets occurs annually based on the value-in-use of the
cash generating units. The value-in-use for the respective units is based on a forecast of future cash flows. These are based on the
2023 budget and subsequently on the business area-specific assumptions of yearly sales growth, Adjusted EBITDA margin and
working capital requirements for the period from 2024 to 2026. These assumptions are set based on the history of the operations,
the objectives in the business plan, the competitiveness of the operations and an assessment of future trends in the business
cycle.

The most important assumptions in the analysis are future growth rate in revenue, Adjusted EBITDA margin and discount rate.
These assumptions are based on the budget and on forecasts built on previous experiences as well as internal and external sources
of information. The assumptions used to extrapolate beyond the latest forecast period are established through the company’s
ability to retain its margins and grow in line with long-term market growth/inflation, based on forecasts from central banks and
similar institutions. Discount rates are established using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM, starting from external assessments
of risk-free rate, volatility, yield requirements on equity and our finance costs for external credit facilities). Annual growth for the
period after 2026 is assumed to be 2.0 per cent (2021: 2.0, 2020: 2.0). The present value of the forecast cash flows has been
calculated with a discount rate of 10.6 per cent (2021: 9.5, 2020: 9.5) before tax, based on a weighted average of the company’s
cost for externally borrowed capital and a theoretical yield requirement on equity considering the specific risk in the business.
As of 31 December 2022, the value-in-use exceeds the carrying amount for all units tested. Thus, there is no impairment, and no
reasonable possible changes in the material assumptions would give rise to impairment.

**Refinancing risk**

Refinancing risk related to the risk that the Group does not have sufficient funds available when these are needed to refinance
loans that fall due, or that the Group encounters difficulties in obtaining new facilities at a given point in time. Ensuring these
needs requires both a strong financial position and active measures to ensure access to credits. The refinancing risk is managed
through such measures as long-term borrowing.

**Currency risk**

Currency risk means the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates will have a negative impact on profit or loss, the statement of
financial position and cash flows. Currency risk can be divided into transaction exposure and translation exposure. Transaction
exposure consists of the net of operating and finance in and outflows in currencies. The Group’s EUR financing is hedged with a
derivative that eliminates the currency risk as regards interest payments and capital liability for which hedge accounting is applied.
Translation exposure consists of the net assets of the Norwegian and Finnish subsidiaries, and their earnings in foreign currencies.

_Sensitivity analysis — currency risk (translation exposure)_

An increase in the EUR/SEK exchange rate of five per cent would negatively or positively impact the Group’s equity by SEK (4.0)
million (2021: (4.0), 2020: 5.0), whereas a similar increase in the NOK/SEK exchange rate would positively impact equity by SEK 18
million (2021: 13, 2020: 9.4).

**Interest rate risk**

Interest rate risk means the risk that interest income is negatively affected or that the value of financial instruments varies due to
changes in market interest rates, which can lead to changes in fair values and changes in cash flows. Exposures arise primarily as
a consequence of the Group’s external interest-bearing borrowings.

_Sensitivity analysis — interest rate risk_

F-38


-----

The impact of an interest rate hike of 1 percentage point at the balance sheet date on interest revenue and interest expenses
during the coming twelve-month period would total SEK 28 million (2021:27, 2020: 20.3), given the interest-bearing assets and
liabilities existing on the balance-sheet date (excluding effects from derivatives).

Financial costs


Financial credit risk arises when cash and cash equivalents are invested, and in conjunction with trading in financial instruments.
These are primarily counterparty risks in connection with receivables in banks and other counterparties that arise when purchasing
derivative financial instruments. As of 31 December 2022, receivables from counterparties regarding derivatives amount to SEK
139 million. There are no receivables in counterparties regarding derivatives as of 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020
respectively. For other financial assets, the credit risk is assumed to correspond to the carrying amounts.

_Credit risks in trade receivables_

The risk that the Group’s or company’s customers cannot fulfil their commitments (i.e. payment is not received from customers)
constitutes a customer credit risk. The Group’s customers are subject to credit checks, in which information about the customers’
financial position is obtained from various credit bureaus. The Group has prepared a credit policy for how customer credits are to
be managed. It indicates, for example, where decisions are made on credit limits of various sizes, and how credits and doubtful
receivables are to be managed. No individual customer represents 10 per cent of net revenue. The Groups companies have
historically had low credit losses, and there are no indications that this will change. For the purpose of assessing the risk in trade
receivables, they are divided into various risks depending on how many days have passed since the due date. Invoices are routinely
sent over the course of the project and in advance. Trade receivables are additionally divided among a great many customers in
various industries and have a broad geographical spread.

###### Note 20 – Measuring financial assets and liabilities at fair value

Measurement at fair value contains a measurement hierarchy regarding input data for the valuations. This measurement hierarchy
is divided into three levels corresponding with the levels introduced in IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.

**_The three levels consist of:_**

Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has access to on the
measurement date.

Level 2: Inputs other than the quoted prices included in Level 1, which are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability.
This can also relate to inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, such as interest rate levels,
yield curves, volatility and multiples.

Level 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. At this level, the assumptions that market participants would make use of
in pricing the asset or liability, including risk assumptions, must be taken into consideration.

**_Classification of fair value_**

Derivatives are valued in accordance with level 2. Fair value adjustments are reported in the hedge reserve. The Group’s
derivatives consist of cross currency interest rate swaps whose fair value is determined by discounting the future cash flows
attributable to the instruments.

Financial assets measured at fair value via other comprehensive income relate primarily to Elajo. Shares in Elajo are recognized at
fair value 30 MSEK (2021: 30, 2020: 30). The valuation is executed according to level 3 since the valuation is based on nonobservable inputs. The fair value has been calculated on the basis of a profit multiple based on operating profit. The profit multiple
is derived based on Assemblin's experience in acquiring unlisted installation companies. In case the profit multiple and/or
operating profit increases, the fair value will also increase. The holdings are recognized through other comprehensive income.
Contingent considerations are reported in accordance with level 3. For all other items, excluding borrowings, the carrying amount
is an approximation of the fair value, which is why these items are not divided into levels under the measurement hierarchy.

Since borrowings via bond loans run with variable interest rates, their carrying amount is also deemed to essentially correspond
to the fair values.

**Warranty commitments**

Provisions for warranties relate to assumed expenditures in the future for rectifying errors and shortcomings regarding concluded
projects that arise during the warranty period for the projects. Provisions for warranties are primarily attributable to projects
concluded in 2021 and 2022 whose warranty period is up to five years. The provision is based on calculations of historical warranty
costs and known complaints. The present values of the provisions are not calculated. Further information concerning important
assessments and estimates is provided in Note 31.

**Restructuring, Onerous leases and disputes**

Among other things, restructuring provisions consist of expenses for future settlements related to the closure of unprofitable
branches in announced restructuring programs. In addition, the Group has several rental agreements for premises with long notice
periods that stand unused as a result of reorganizations. Provisions have been made for commitments to pay peripheral expenses
over and above rental expenses during the remainder of the contract period.

For construction contracts where it is likely that the total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is
immediately recognized as a cost in its entirety. An onerous contract is a contract in which the unavoidable costs for meeting the
obligations under the contract exceed the anticipated financial benefits.

Provisions for disputes and other provisions are based on individual risk evaluation as per the balance sheet date and are primarily
related to acquisitions and adjustments of acquisition balances.

###### Note 31 – Critical estimates and judgements

Company management has discussed the development and choice of the Group’s critical accounting policies and estimates, the
information concerning them, and the application of these policies and estimates with the Audit Committee.

**Critical estimates**

Certain critical estimates are described below.

**_Recognition of revenue over time_**

The reported earnings in ongoing contract projects are recognized over time on the basis of assignment expenditures incurred in
relation to the total estimated assignment fees of the assignment. Costs associated with this are recognized in profit or loss as
they arise. This requires reliable calculation of project revenue and project costs. The precondition is a properly functioning system
for cost accounting, forecasting processes and project monitoring. The forecast regarding the project’s final outcome is a critical
judgement that is material to the operating report over the course of the project. There may be a risk that the final result as
regards the project could deviate from what is recognized over time.

**_Pensions_**

Assemblin has defined benefit pension plans. The pension obligations are calculated using actuarial assumptions, as of the balance
sheet date, the present value of the obligations is reported. A change in any of these assumptions and measurements could have
a significant impact on calculated pension commitments and pension costs.

**_Intangible assets_**

_Impairment testing of goodwill_

The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units are based on the assumption of future conditions and estimates of various
parameters. Changes in these assumptions and estimates could have an effect on the carrying amount of goodwill. A recession in
the rate of growth and operating margin would yield a lower recoverable amount. The reverse applies if the recoverable amount
were calculated based on a higher rate of growth or margin. If future cash flows are discounted at a higher interest rate, the
recoverable amount would be lower. The reverse would apply if the recoverable amount were to rise in conjunction with
discounting at a lower discount rate.

F-51


-----

**_Warranty provisions_**

In the Assemblin Group, warranty provisions are made for the warranty obligations found in the installation assignments being
performed. A warranty expenditure arises in a project when a Group company performs additional work as a result of
shortcomings that emerged in the original contract, in work performed or in materials. A warranty reserve is calculated based on
the probable costs of correcting the faults that arose in the contract. The scope of the warranty provision is established based on:

(a) previous experiences in similar projects;
(b) the anticipated scope of the extra work; and
(c) the estimated cost.

**_Onerous contract_**

When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is immediately recognized as an
expense in its entirety. An onerous contract is a contract in which the unavoidable costs for meeting the obligations under the
contract exceed the anticipated financial benefits. The expected loss is immediately recognized as a cost in its entirety.

###### Note 32 – Related parties

**Relationship with related parties**

The parent company has a related party relationship with its subsidiaries and the holdings in the subsidiaries are presented in
Note 30. For other non-current liabilities and interest rates, refer to Notes 9 and 18, respectively.

###### Note 35 – Alternative performance measures

This document contains alternative performance measures. These measures describe historical financial performance, but exclude
or include amounts that would not be adjusted for in the most comparable IFRS financial measure. The alternative performance
measures are used internally by management, in conjunction with IFRS financial measures, to measure performance and make
decisions regarding the future direction of the business. Management believes these alternative performance measures, when
provided in combination with reported IFRS financial measures, provide helpful supplementary information for investors. These
measures are not substitute for or superior to, and should be used in conjunction with, reported IFRS financial measures. In
addition, the alternative performance measures, as defined by Assemblin, may not be comparable to other similarly titled
measures used by other companies. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these alternative performance
measures.

       Independent Auditor’s Report on Review of Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial
       Statements
          To the Board of Directors of Assemblin Group AB (publ), corporate identity number 559077-5952
        Introduction
        We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements of Assemblin Group AB
          (publ) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) as of 31 March 2023, included on pages F-56 to F-66 in this document, which
         comprises:
                  - The condensed consolidated statements of financial position as at 31 March 2023:
                  - the condensed consolidated statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the three-month
              period ended 31 March 2023;
                   - the condensed consolidated statements of changes in equity for the three-month period ended 31 March
             2023;
                   - the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the three-month period ended 31 March 2023; and
                  - notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements.
         The Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these
        condensed consolidated interim financial statements in accordance with IAS 34 “Inteirm Financial Reporting”. Our
         responsibility is to express a conclusion on these condensed consolidated interim financial statements based on our
         review.
       Scope of review
        We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements ISRE 2410 Review of
         Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity. A review of interim financial
         information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and
         applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
        accordance with International Standards on Auditing and other generally accepted auditing practices and consequently
         does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in
          an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
        Conclusion
        Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed consolidated
         interim financial statements as at 31 March, 2023 is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34
         “Interim Financial Reporting”.

###### Notes

 1. Accounting policies

These condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 “Interim financial
reporting”. The same accounting policies and bases for calculation have been applied in these interim financial statements as in
the consolidated financial statements for the year 2022, 2021 and 2020. These condensed consolidated interim financial
statements for the interim period have been prepared for Assemblin Group (“the Group”) and include Assemblin Group AB (publ)
(559077-5952) and its subsidiaries.

**Seasonality**

The operating results generally vary from quarter to quarter as a result of seasonal fluctuations. During the first quarter of the
year, sales and margins are usually lower due to reduction in production attributed to inclement weather and the large number
of public holidays (New Year, and sometimes Easter) as well as a calendar effect of more projects being completed during the
fourth quarter. However, cash flow in the first quarter is normally positively affected by the stronger earnings from the fourth
quarter.

###### 4. Financial assets

Shareholdings in Elajo are reported at fair value. The shares are attributed to level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because they are
not listed on a regulated market and no observable transactions have been made in the Company recently. As of 31 March 2023,
fair value amounted to SEK 30 million and, at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, fair value amounted to SEK 30 million (30).

Amounts entered as liabilities that may come to be paid out to previous owners (contingent purchase considerations) amounted
to SEK 526 million (386) as of 31 March 2023 and are classified in accordance with level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The Group’s
derivatives consist of currency interest rate swaps whose fair value is determined by discounting the future cash flows attributable
to the instruments. The amount entered as an asset amount to SEK 172 million and is classified in accordance with level 2 in the
fair value hierarchy. The issue of EUR 100 million in January 2021 has not been hedged. The fair values of the Group’s long-term
assets and liabilities do not differ significantly from the reported values.

###### 5. Non-current liabilities

As of 31 March 2023, non-current liabilities included pension provisions of SEK 596 million (SEK 548 million as of 31 December
2022). The present value of the pension obligations is determined by an independent actuary applying several financial
assumptions. Assumptions regarding inflation and future wage increases have decreased since the comparison quarter, reducing
the liability whilst the discount rate has increased, resulting in a further reduction. The key assumptions for defined benefit
obligations are:

31-Mar-2023 31-Dec-2022

Discount rate 4,00% 4,00%

Wage increase 2,60% 2,60%

Inflation 2,10% 2,10%

###### 6. Related party transactions

No transactions have occurred between Assemblin and related parties that substantially impacted the Company’s financial
position and earnings.

###### 7. Events after the balance-sheet date

At the Annual General Meeting on March 31 2023, Mats Jönsson was elected Assemblin’s new Chairman of the Board. Mats
Jönsson replaced Fredrik Wirdenius, who had declined re-election. In early April, Assemblin Norway acquired electrical engineering
company Fjorden Elektro AS, with annual sales of NOK 50 million and 26 employees and announced the establishment of an
independent electrical engineering organization. At the end of April, Assemblin Ventilation divested the Totalplåt production units
in Malmö and Linköping, with some 26 employees and annual sales equivalent to SEK 45 million. In May Assemblin Electrical
acquired Elia AB with operations in the Kalmar region, about 60 employees and annual sales of approximately SEK 140 million. On
May 4, Assemblin´s principle owner Triton announced that Assemblin has been sold from Triton Fund IV to Triton IV Continuation
Fund, and hence Apollo Swedish Bidco AB is the new parent company of Assemblin Group AB. In the end of May 2023, Assemblin
has acquired all of the shares in Ingeniørfirmaet R. Torgersen AS in Bergen, thereby further strengthening its ventilation initiative.
The acquisition also entails Assemblin establishing operations in the Vestland region for the first time. No other significant events
of a company-specific nature have occurred following the balance sheet date

###### 8. Alternative performance measures

This document contains alternative performance measures. These measures describe historical financial performance, but exclude
or include amounts that would not be adjusted for in the most comparable IFRS financial measure. The alternative performance
measures are used internally by management, in conjunction with IFRS financial measures, to measure performance and make
decisions regarding the future direction of the business. Management believes these alternative performance measures, when
