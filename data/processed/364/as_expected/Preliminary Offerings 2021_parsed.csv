Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such securities (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturer’s target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. The securities described in the attached preliminary offering memorandum are not intended to be offered, or sold to and should not be offered, or sold to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and, therefore, offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and, therefore, offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, all statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this offering memorandum, including, without limitation, those regarding the Group’s and the Target Business’ future financial position and results of operations, its strategy, plans, objectives, goals and targets, future developments in the markets in which the Group or the Target Business participate or are seeking to participate or anticipated regulatory changes in the markets in which the Group or the Target Business operate or intend to operate. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “aim,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “guidance,” “intend,” “may,” “ongoing,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “projected,” “propose,” “seek,” “should,” “targets” or “will” or the negative of such terms or other variation or comparable terminology. Forward-looking statements and estimated future financial information are not audited by an auditor._ By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future, many of which are beyond the Group’s control and all of which are based on management’s current beliefs and expectations about future events. The Issuer cautions you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are based on numerous assumptions and that the Group’s and/or the Target Business’, as the context requires, actual results of operations, including its financial condition and liquidity and the development of the industry in which the Group and/or the Target Business operate, may differ materially from (and be more negative than) those made in, or suggested by, the forward-looking statements contained in this offering memorandum. In addition, even if the Group’s and/or the Target Business’ results of operations, including its financial condition and liquidity and the development of the industry in which the Group and/or the Target Business operate, are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this offering memorandum, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. Important risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause these differences include, but are not limited to: - general economic development, but particularly in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates; - the current COVID-19 pandemic or similar incidents; - structural development as well as cyclicality of relevant underlying end-markets; - changes in the competitive environment, including the potential impact on price levels for certain applications; - market trends and technological developments; - continued ability to sustain the Group’s competitive differentiation and provide high quality products on time; - managing customer and supplier concentration in specific business areas and for certain products as well as components; - potential disruptions in the Group’s supply or delivery chain and overall performance of the Group’s global operations; - obtaining the required funding from customers for joint and project-specific R&D activities; - risks related to the realization of our estimated order intake and order backlog; - the Group’s ability (and that of relevant stakeholders within the value chain) to obtain or maintain sufficient financing; - changes in currency exchange rates; - changes in regulatory environment, e.g., export controls, tariffs and other trade barriers; - reductions in government spending with an impact on customer behavior; - audits by the Group’s customers on government contracts; - government contracting risks; - the Combined Group’s dependency on a limited number of customers and programs; - attracting and retaining qualified executives and talent; ----- - successful integration of recent or future acquisitions or investments; - the performance of the Group’s global operations; - managing reliance on complex IT systems and networks; - maintaining an effective system of internal controls; - property loss and unforeseen business interruption; - the forward-looking industry and market information presented in this offering memorandum; and - other factors discussed in “Risk Factors.” The risks described in the “Risk Factors” section of this offering memorandum are not exhaustive. Other sections of this offering memorandum describe additional factors that could adversely affect the Group’s and the Target Business’ business, financial condition and results of operations. New risks may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for the Group to predict all such risks, nor can the Issuer assess the impact of all such risks on the Group’s or the Target Business’ business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. The Issuer urges you to read carefully the sections of this offering memorandum entitled “Risk Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Former RENK _AG Group and RENK Holding GmbH Group,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Target Business,” “Industry and Competition” and “Business” for a more_ complete discussion of the factors that could affect the Group’s future performance and the markets in which the Group operates. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking statements described in this offering memorandum may not be accurate or occur at all. Accordingly, prospective investors should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which the statements were made (and in any case no later than the date of this offering memorandum). The Issuer undertakes no obligation, and does not intend, to update or revise any forward-looking statements or risk factors, whether as a result of new information, future events or developments or otherwise.

On October 5, 2020, the Issuer changed its legal form to a German stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft) under the name Rebecca BidCo AG. On February 15, 2021, the Issuer as surviving entity merged with the former Renk Aktiengesellschaft (“former RENK AG”) with retrospective effect as of January 1, 2020 and, as a result of such merger, acquired all assets and assumed all liabilities of the former RENK AG. On April 14, 2021, the Issuer changed its legal form to a German limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) under the name RENK GmbH. Prior to its merger with the former RENK AG, the Issuer was a holding company with no sales revenuegenerating activities of its own, and did not have any business operations or material assets (other than its shareholding in the former RENK AG). The audited consolidated financial statements, including the related notes thereto, of the former RENK AG as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 (with comparative financial information as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018), included in this offering memorandum have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”) and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB). The audited consolidated financial statements of the former RENK AG as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, along with the independent auditor’s report (Bestätigungsvermerk des unabhängigen Abschlussprüfers) of PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (“PwC”) with respect thereto, and the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the former RENK AG as of and for the three month period ended March 31, 2020, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as applicable for interim financial reporting (IAS 34), are included in this offering memorandum. On February 15, 2021, the former RENK AG was merged into the Issuer (as the surviving entity) with retrospective effect as of January 1, 2020. Therefore, no historical consolidated financial information for the former RENK AG as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 is available. The Issuer did not prepare audited consolidated financial statements. In this offering memorandum, we therefore include audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the short fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 and unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements as of and for the three month period ended March 31, 2021 of RENK Holding GmbH. The short fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 of RENK Holding GmbH comprises the period from January 2, 2020 to December 31, 2020, and includes the operations of the former RENK AG Group only from the date of the consummation of the Renk Acquisition in October 2020.

Prior to that date, RENK Holding GmbH was a holding company without sales revenuegenerating activities. The consolidated financial information of RENK Holding GmbH as of and for the short fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 included elsewhere in this offering memorandum is therefore not ----- comparable to the consolidated financial information of the former RENK AG as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.

In implementing IFRS 16, the former RENK AG selected the modified retrospective approach as the transition method, which means that the comparison figures for 2018 are not restated in its consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, and thus not comparable. In order to facilitate a comparison between periods, the details of the income statement and statement of financial position items affected by the implementation of IFRS 16 are summarized in “Management’s Discussion and _Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Former RENK AG Group and RENK Holding GmbH Group—Accounting Standards Adopted from the Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2019.”_",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

The purpose of the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information is to illustrate the material effects (i) the consummated Renk Acquisition and (ii) the contemplated Acquisition would have had on the historical consolidated financial statements of RENK Holding GmbH if the RENK Holding GmbH Group had already existed in the structure created by the Renk Acquisition and the Acquisition as of January 1, 2020 with respect to the unaudited pro forma consolidated income statements and as of March 31, 2021 with respect to the unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of financial position. The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information was prepared on the basis of the IDW Accounting Practice Statement: Preparation of Pro Forma Financial Information (IDW AcPS AAB 1.004) promulgated by the German Institute of Public Auditors (Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer in Deutschland e.V., _IDW)._ The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information is based on certain assumptions and is presented for illustrative purposes only. Due to its nature, the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information describes only a hypothetical situation and, therefore, does not purport to represent what the actual results of operations or financial position of the RENK Holding GmbH Group would have been if the Renk Acquisition and the Acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2020 with respect to the unaudited pro forma consolidated income statements or the Acquisition as of March 31, 2021 with respect to the unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of financial position, nor is it necessarily indicative of RENK Holding Group’s results of operations or financial position after the completion of the Acquisition. In addition, the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information is necessarily not indicative of RENK Holding GmbH’s future operating results or financial position. Therefore, RENK Holding GmbH Group’s actual results of operations and financial position after the completion of the Acquisition may differ significantly from those reflected in the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information. Furthermore, the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information is only meaningful in conjunction with RENK Holding GmbH’s historical consolidated financial statements as of and for the short fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 and unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of RENK Holding GmbH as of and for the three month period ended March 31, 2021.

In 1879, the company moved to Augsburg-Göggingen, Germany, which remains the Group’s headquarters. RENK was transformed into a stock corporation in ----- 1897, and in 1923 RENK became part of the MAN Group. Following the majority takeover of MAN SE by Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft in 2011, RENK also became a member of the Volkswagen Group. In April 2019, RENK acquired the armored vehicle suspension systems provider Horstman Group, which added to its manufacturing capacity in the United Kingdom and the United States, while also improving the Group’s access to new defense end-markets. RENK also acquired a minority stake in Modest Tree, a technology leader in developing virtual- and augmented reality applications and software without coding (e.g., to create immersive training solutions). In January 2020, the Issuer entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a 76% shareholding in the former RENK AG from the Volkswagen Group. In connection with the acquisition, the Issuer also acquired shares in the former RENK AG representing approximately 15% of the entire outstanding share capital by way of a voluntary public takeover offer. Following consummation of the acquisition and voluntary public takeover offer in October 2020, the Issuer initiated a merger squeeze-out process, which was completed in February 2021. As a result, the former RENK AG was merged into the Issuer as the surviving entity and the Sponsor indirectly acquired 100% of the former RENK Group.

On October 5, 2020, the Issuer changed its legal form to a German stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft) under the name Rebecca BidCo AG. On February 15, 2021, the Issuer as surviving entity merged with the former Renk Aktiengesellschaft (“former RENK AG”) with retrospective effect as of January 1, 2020 and, as a result of such merger, acquired all assets and assumed all liabilities of the former RENK AG. On April 14, 2021, the Issuer changed its legal form to a German limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) under the name RENK GmbH. Prior to its merger with the former RENK AG, the Issuer was a holding company with no sales revenuegenerating activities of its own, and did not have any business operations or material assets (other than its shareholding in the former RENK AG). The audited consolidated financial statements, including the related notes thereto, of the former RENK AG as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 (with comparative financial information as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018), included in this offering memorandum have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”) and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB). The audited consolidated financial statements of the former RENK AG as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, along with the independent auditor’s report (Bestätigungsvermerk des unabhängigen Abschlussprüfers) of PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (“PwC”) with respect thereto, and the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the former RENK AG as of and for the three month period ended March 31, 2020, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as applicable for interim financial reporting (IAS 34), are included in this offering memorandum. On February 15, 2021, the former RENK AG was merged into the Issuer (as the surviving entity) with retrospective effect as of January 1, 2020. Therefore, no historical consolidated financial information for the former RENK AG as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 is available. The Issuer did not prepare audited consolidated financial statements. In this offering memorandum, we therefore include audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the short fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 and unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements as of and for the three month period ended March 31, 2021 of RENK Holding GmbH. The short fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 of RENK Holding GmbH comprises the period from January 2, 2020 to December 31, 2020, and includes the operations of the former RENK AG Group only from the date of the consummation of the Renk Acquisition in October 2020.

The audited consolidated financial statements of RENK Holding GmbH as of and for the short fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, along with the independent auditor’s report of Ernst & Young GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (“EY”) with respect thereto, and the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of RENK ----- Holding GmbH as of and for the three month period ended March 31, 2021, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as applicable for interim financial reporting (IAS 34), are included in this offering memorandum.

Prior to that date, RENK Holding GmbH was a holding company without sales revenuegenerating activities. The consolidated financial information of RENK Holding GmbH as of and for the short fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 included elsewhere in this offering memorandum is therefore not comparable to the consolidated financial information of the former RENK AG as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.

This unaudited financial information is presented for illustrative purposes only and not necessarily representative of the Group’s results of operations for such a period or any future period. In particular, the unaudited financial information of RENK Holding GmbH Group for the twelve month period ended March 31, 2021 only takes into account the effects of the Original Transactions (including the related financing) on the Group for the three month period ended March 31, 2021 and not for any other period included therein. (2) EBITDA is defined as operating profit before depreciation, amortization and impairment losses on intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA, as adjusted for certain items which management considers to be exceptional or non-recurring in nature. These measures are not defined financial measures under IFRS. It should be noted in this context that not all companies calculate these items that are not defined under IFRS in the same manner, and that consequently the measures reported are not necessarily comparable with similarly described measures employed by other companies. EBITDA Margin and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are defined as EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA, as applicable, divided by sales revenue. The calculations for Adjusted EBITDA are based on various assumptions, management estimates and unaudited management accounts. These amounts have not been audited, reviewed or verified by any auditor. This information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. It may not give an accurate or complete picture of the financial condition or results of operations for the periods presented and may not be comparable to the Group’s consolidated financial statements or other financial information included in this offering memorandum and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision. The Group presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes Adjusted EBITDA is helpful to investors as measures of its operating performance and ability to service its debt.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA, as adjusted for certain items which management considers to be exceptional or non-recurring in nature. These measures are not defined financial measures under US GAAP. It should be noted in this context that not all companies calculate these items that are not defined under US GAAP in the same manner, and that consequently the measures reported are not necessarily comparable with similarly described measures employed by other companies.

A slowdown in the global economy and elevated levels of private and public debt in various countries may cause demand to decline in many of its key markets. The situation may be exacerbated by protectionist tendencies, uncertainties regarding future monetary policy, armed conflicts that remain unresolved and related migration trends as well as the spread of infectious diseases (currently COVID-19). Also see “—The Combined Group’s business and results of operations have been and may continue _to be adversely affected by the recent COVID-19 outbreak or other similar outbreaks.” As part of the capital_ goods industry, the Combined Group is also exposed to fluctuations in the overall investment climate. Fluctuations in growth rates or forecasts, or alterations in government investment subsidies, can result in significant changes in demand for capital goods in the Combined Group’s markets, cancellations of orders already booked or the reorganization of longer-term business relationships. Therefore, the Combined Group’s sales revenue and results of operations have been influenced, and will continue to be influenced, by macroeconomic trends and the general state and performance of the global economy. Although the global economy has recovered from the downturn in 2008 and 2009, there can be no assurance that such recovery is sustainable or that there will be no recurrence of the financial and economic crisis or similar adverse market conditions. The outlook for the world economy remains subject to uncertainty, particularly in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has already lead to, and may continue to lead to prolonged, periods of economic uncertainty in many of the Combined Group’s geographies. According to the International Monetary Fund, global GDP is estimated to have decreased by 3.3% in 2020. While there are early signs of a global recovery, the economic outlook remains highly uncertain and depends to a large degree on the future development of the COVID-19 pandemic and fiscal policies. Moreover, the uncertainty following the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU (“Brexit”), the trade conflict between the United States and China and further changes to the trade policy of the United States may have a material adverse effect on the economy in the EU, including the German economy. Limitations impacting international trade, may have a negative impact on the export economy in general, and on the Group’s sales and results of operations in particular. The Group particularly sees the risk that individual countries might take increasingly protectionist measures to improve their competitiveness in the global market, and other countries may institute corresponding countermeasures. This might result in market access barriers, such as higher import duties or more complicated certification processes in order to reduce imports, up to an international trade war. The markets for products in the military and government environment are also subject to additional event risks on account of their dependence on political decision-making—as regards opinions on export control law, the stipulations made by supplier countries such as Germany, France, the United Kingdom and the United States and the respective political environment in the target countries. There are also uncertainties due to cash-strapped public sectors in many countries, and demands for local content and technology transfer. ----- The materialization of any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on the Combined Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511
364,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to the Market and the Combined Group’s Business,13.1.2,The Combined Group’s business and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the current COVID-19 pandemic or other similar outbreaks.,"Since early 2020, the global spread of COVID-19, commonly known as “coronavirus,” has created significant macroeconomic uncertainty, volatility and disruption. In response, many governments have implemented policies intended to stop or slow the further spread of the disease, such as lockdowns, or restricted movement guidelines. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or other similar outbreaks or adverse public health developments or measures imposed to contain such outbreak, particularly in Europe and the United States, the Combined Group’s business operations may experience delays or disruptions, such as the temporary suspension of operations at one or more of the Combined Group’s manufacturing facilities and supply chains being interrupted, slowed, or rendered inoperable. In particular, the Combined Group’s field service engineers might not be able to conduct their business as usual due to lockdown measures. This has already contributed to sales revenue decreasing by 1.5% from €558,609 thousand in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 for the former RENK AG Group to as if €550,207 thousand for the former RENK AG Group in the twelve month period ended December 31, 2020 . Should the current situation continue for a significant and unforeseeable amount of time, this could result in further sales revenue declines. In addition, the Combined Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected to the extent that the COVID-19 or any other pandemic or outbreak harms the international economy in general. The outbreak of COVID-19 might also have a long-term, impact in policy priorities in government spending to contain COVID-19 and its effect on macroeconomic conditions and may lead to reduced defense budgets and a delay in defense projects in general. The spread of COVID-19 has caused the Group to modify its business practices (including employee travel, employee work locations and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events, fairs and conferences), and the Group may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that it determines are in the best interests of its employees, customers and business partners. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus or otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Group temporarily closed its facilities in France, India and the United Arab Emirates in 2020 and in 2021. The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak continues to impact the Combined Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at present, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 disease, the emergence of new variants of COVID-19, the effectiveness of vaccines and other actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. Even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided, the Combined Group may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to its business as a result of its global economic impact, including any recession and economic downturn that has occurred or may occur in the future. There are no comparable recent events which may provide guidance as to the effect of the spread of COVID-19 and a global pandemic, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 outbreak or a similar health pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. The Combined Group does not yet know the full extent of the impacts on its business, its operations or the global economy as a whole. However, the effects could have a material adverse effect on the Combined Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects its business, financial condition and results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511
364,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to the Market and the Combined Group’s Business,13.1.3,The Combined Group operates in markets that are competitive.,"The markets in which the Combined Group operates are competitive and have been characterized by changes in market penetration, price competition, and the development and introduction of new products, product designs and technologies. The Combined Group competes primarily on the basis of quality, innovation, timeliness of delivery and design as well as the ability to provide engineering support, repair know-how and service on a global basis. Should the Combined Group fail to secure the quality and reliability of its products as well as the reliability of its supply in the future, its customers may decide to procure products from its competitors. In particular in the civil marine market and several industrial end-markets that are currently under strain, the Group has observed that competitors are seeking to increase their market share by offering ----- customers competitive prices. Accordingly, this increases pressure on the Group’s business units to make production more cost efficient so that they can continue to secure customer orders in the future. The Combined Group faces substantial competitive pressure, including with respect to localization requirements and export controls in many markets, also comprising the Combined Group’s core sales markets. For example, in the defense business, the market accessible for the Combined Group with respect to mediumweight and heavy tracked vehicles has comparatively few comprehensive procurement projects that require long implementation periods and frequently feature only limited numbers. In particular, the use of German export controls increasingly affects the decision-making of potential customers. Lengthy processes at the competent German authorities may result in permits not being granted for deliveries of spare parts in a timely manner, which may result in customers seeking alternative suppliers. With respect to the Combined Group’s industrial markets, new competitors enter the markets the Combined Group serves, as well as new customers who bring new customer needs and demands to which the Combined Group may be unable to adapt. Entry of new players in any of its markets may make it difficult for the Combined Group to increase its market share, retain existing competitive positions or access new markets at all. In addition, some of the industries and markets in which the Combined Group is active are characterized by the establishment of new (local) competitors reducing dependence on foreign suppliers, particularly for the more time-sensitive aftermarket business. Increasing pricing-pressure in a more competitive market environment, combined with increased requirements concerning product performance and enhanced functionalities, may create a challenge to offset effects from a price and cost perspective. If the Combined Group is unable to offset price reductions through improved operating efficiencies and the realization of synergies, price reductions could negatively impact the Combined Group’s profit margins. In its industrial markets, the Combined Group is also increasingly faced with competitors from emerging countries who are exerting pressure on market prices. In addition, the Combined Group’s customers are faced with competitive pressures, which are passed on to their suppliers including the Combined Group. The Combined Group is also faced with a shift of production of its customers to leading-cost countries, which typically requires the Combined Group to follow the customer with respect to its production capabilities. In addition, additional competitive pressure is added by the continuing trend of replacing slide bearings with rolling bearings for the lower power ranges. In addition, some of the industries and markets in which the Group is active are characterized by consolidation among competitors and OEMs. Any future consolidation among the Combined Group’s competitors and OEMs could allow them to benefit from economies of scale, offer more comprehensive combined product portfolios, and allow them to better penetrate the combined installed base with service offerings. This could require the Combined Group to accept reductions in its profit margins and the loss of market share due to price pressure. The materialization of any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on the Combined Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511
364,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to the Market and the Combined Group’s Business,13.1.4,"Export controls, tariffs and other trade barriers could affect the Combined Group’s ability to produce, market and sell its products across global markets and affect the Combined Group’s supply chains.","As a global manufacturer of vehicle transmissions and engines, gear units, slide bearings, suspension systems, hybrid drive systems, couplings and test systems, the Combined Group sources its production inputs from across the world, occasionally relies on global supply chains, and maintains production and sales operations in a large number of markets globally. This requires an established and efficiently connected infrastructure allowing for the cross-border transport of supplies, parts and products. This is even more important as the Combined Group seeks to globalize its operations. The markets for products in the military and government environment are also subject to further highly likely event risks on account of their dependence on political decision-making—as regards opinions on export control law, the stipulations made by supplier countries such as Germany, France, the United Kingdom and the United States and the respective political environment in the target countries. In recent years, political distress, warfare, terrorist attacks, changing attitudes regarding globalization and other economic and geopolitical developments have led to the introduction of new export controls or stricter application of existing export controls in a number of jurisdictions around the world. The Combined Group’s business, in particular its defense business, is subject to various risks that could have a material adverse effect on its business as whole, including: sanctions, import and export restrictions and tariffs, including restrictions promulgated by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the US Department of the Treasury, and other trade protection regulations and measures, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations. ----- As regards the United States, the Combined Group’s supply chain is also subject to the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) which are export control regulations enforced by the Bureau of Industry and Security of the Department of Commerce (“BIS”). The EAR regulates commercial commodities, software and technology, as “dual-use” items (having both commercial and military application) and certain defense items that are listed in the EAR Commerce Control List. In certain cases, prior licensing from the Department of Commerce is needed before the export of the controlled product or technology can occur. The refusal of licenses or the tightening of the EAR export regulations can have a material adverse effect on the Combined Group’s business. Furthermore, the nature of the Target Business’s activities and operations subjects it to significant government regulation including the requirements and obligations imposed under the EAR as well as requirements and obligations under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”). The ITAR are export control regulations administered and enforced by the Department of State’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (“DDTC”). The importance of export compliance for US companies like the Target Business that are engaged in significant overseas business involving controlled items and technologies imposes substantial compliance burdens and costs. It is essential that the Target Business maintain the resources and means necessary to assume these compliance obligations as a standalone business following the closing of the Acquisition. Failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations may expose the Combined Group to reputational harm as well as significant penalties, including criminal fines, imprisonment, civil fines, disgorgement of profits, injunctions and debarment from government contracts, as well as other remedial measures. Investigations of alleged violations can be expensive and disruptive. Despite the Combined Group’s compliance efforts and activities, the Combined Group cannot assure compliance by its employees or representatives for which it may be held responsible, and any such violation could materially adversely affect the Combined Group’s reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. Following Brexit on January 31, 2020, the EU and the United Kingdom ratified a trade and cooperation agreement governing their future relationship. The agreement addresses trade, economic arrangements, law enforcement, judicial cooperation and a governance framework including procedures for dispute resolution, among other things. Because the agreement merely sets forth a framework in many respects and will require complex additional bilateral negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU as both parties continue to work on the rules for implementation, significant political and economic uncertainty remains about how the precise terms of the relationship between the parties will differ from the terms before withdrawal. In particular, Brexit poses additional challenges both to the supply of goods from the EU to the United Kingdom. For example, trade between the EU and the United Kingdom fell sharply at the beginning of 2021 as a result of new rules for trade including new border control procedures and customs forms. If the EU or the United Kingdom were to impose additional tariffs or other trade barriers, this could disrupt cross-border supply chains further. In the United States, a recent reorientation of the country’s overall economic policy occurred and, as a consequence, any introduction of regional or international trade barriers, including anti-dumping customs duties such as those imposed by the previous US administration for imported steel and aluminum, changes in taxation which have similar effects, or withdrawal from or renegotiation of multilateral trade agreements by the current administration could adversely impact the Combined Group’s business operations and results of operations through less favorable conditions for the import of its products. Moreover, any countermeasures by regional or global trading partners, including the EU and China, could slow down global economic growth and also have an adverse impact on the export of the Combined Group’s products manufactured in the United States and elsewhere. Laws and regulations regarding export controls may originate nationally, bilaterally or even multilaterally between or among participating jurisdictions with a differing reach as to national or even extraterritorial application and relevance. Typically, export controls will apply to the transfer of pre-identified, listed products or categories of sensitive goods through the requirements of permits, limitations or prohibitions of sale. This causes an increasing need for compliance measures, including the identification of critical goods, geographical sensitivities and contractual protections, as well as the adaptation of existing agreements and local sales practices and the ability to take short-term measures should events, trends or restrictions arise or increase in a way that affected the Combined Group’s business practices. Consequently, the Combined Group faces potential further increases in costs to be prepared for adverse developments of this type and for ongoing compliance with export controls relating to its commercial activities. Moreover, as export controls may change, be newly introduced on short notice, be difficult to interpret or be applied in an unexpected manner, there can be no assurances that the Group’s internal controls and compliance systems are adequate to address all applicable risks. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

The Combined Group’s business requires a high level of technical expertise for the design, development and manufacture of its products. The Combined Group invests in technology, new materials and innovation which it believes will be critical to its long term growth and the Combined Group needs to continually adapt its expertise in response to emerging technological innovations, industry standards and customer requirements or preferences. The industrial markets in which the Combined Group is active are characterized by megatrends, such as electrification, power efficiency and automation, renewable energies and hybridization. In addition, digitalization is progressing rapidly and has already transformed certain sectors. The pace of implementation and adaptation represents an important success factor in this regard and, therefore, also a risk. There can be no assurance that (i) the Combined Group will be successful in developing new products or systems or in bringing them to market in a timely manner, including due to an inability to effectively implement its business strategy or at all, (ii) products or technologies developed by others will not render the Combined Group’s offerings obsolete or non-competitive, (iii) the Combined Group’s customers will not substitute its products with competing products or alternate technologies, (iv) the market will accept the Combined Group’s innovations, (v) the Combined Group’s competitors will not be able to produce its non-patented products more inexpensively from other sources, (vi) the Combined Group will be able to anticipate its customers’ needs and provide products to meet those needs and (vii) the Combined Group will be able to adjust its cost structure in the event of contraction of demand. Should the Combined Group fail to develop appropriate strategies as a response to these or similar market trends and should the Combined Group fail to enhance existing products, develop new products or keep pace with developing technology, growth opportunities could be lost or the Combined Group could lose existing customers. Furthermore, if the Combined Group devotes resources to the pursuit of new technologies and products that fail to be accepted in the marketplace or that fail to be commercially viable, all or part of these engineering and development expenses may be lost and the Combined Group’s business may suffer.

Reductions in government spending could adversely affect the Combined Group’s business, results of operations and financial condition.","Approximately two thirds of the Combined Group’s sales revenue was generated in defense end-markets, in particular by sales of vehicle transmissions and engines as well as suspension systems and naval gear units, in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. The Combined Group’s customers include governments, public authorities and companies that rely on government spending to purchase its products and services. The Combined Group expects that defense spending, in particular, by these customers, will continue to make up a significant part of the Combined Group’s sales revenue in the future. However, government programs may be cancelled, delayed or amended based on many factors over which the Combined Group has no control, including socio-political considerations, general macroeconomic conditions or changes in government or administrative policy. Accordingly, the Combined Group may face uncertainties in planning and managing its resources. In addition, government spending programs, even if previously approved, are typically subject to anti-deficiency rules and annual reviews and adjustments and may, therefore, be cancelled at any time. Changes in political or public support for security and defense programs may also affect related government programs and defense spending. Geopolitical developments, including economic sanctions, could also affect demand for the Combined Group’s products and services. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic might also have an impact on policy priorities in government spending to contain COVID-19 and its effect on macroeconomic conditions and may lead to reduced defense budgets. See “—The Combined Group’s business _and results of operations have been and may and continue to be adversely affected by the current COVID-19 pandemic or similar outbreaks.”_ The realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on the Combined Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

The laws and regulations to which the Combined Group is subject differ materially depending on the contracting government and conflicting rules or blocking statutes in such laws and regulations may prevent the Combined Group from taking on contracts with other governments. For example in Germany, applicable laws and regulation include, but are not limited to the Security Clearance Act (Sicherheitsüberprüfungsgesetz/SÜG) and the Secret Protection Manual (Geheimschutzhandbuch) of the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie). In the United States, the Combined Group’s federal government contracts subject it to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”) and agency supplemental regulations like the DFARS, the Competition in Contracting Act, the National Industrial Security Program (“NISP”), the False Claims Act and myriad other procurement-related laws, rules and regulations. The Combined Group is also strictly bound by contractual obligations to comply with such laws and regulations. If the Combined Group is found to have violated such laws or regulations, the Combined Group may be subject to civil or criminal proceedings and penalties as well as administrative sanctions or fines, including reductions in the value of contracts, contract modifications or terminations, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, contractual penalties, fines, suspension, debarment or other prohibition from doing business with the respective government (e.g., prohibited from participating in future public procurement procedures). In addition, the Combined Group could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against the Combined Group. As a result of the need to comply with these laws and regulations, the Combined Group is subject to increased risks of governmental investigations, civil fraud actions, criminal prosecutions, whistleblower lawsuits and other enforcement actions. The Combined Group also derives significant revenue from cost reimbursable defense contracts, where the consideration for the goods to be delivered or services to be rendered are based upon the cost incurred by the Combined Group in manufacturing and delivering them. The Combined Group is therefore exposed to enhanced risk of audit by government auditors to ensure that representations of cost are accurate in all material respects. Misrepresentations of cost could subject the Combined Group to the risks noted above. The Combined Group also derives revenue from fixed price contracts where the consideration for the goods or services delivered or provided are fixed at the time of contract award. The Combined Group is therefore exposed to risk that the actual costs incurred in connection with performing its obligations under such firm fixed price contracts are higher than assumed at the time of the contract. The Target Business may miscalculate these or costs or these costs may rise after the date of the relevant contract, including for reasons that are beyond the Target Business’s control, such as increases in material costs, unexpected technical difficulties or delays. Any failure by the Target Business to correctly estimate or control the costs incurred by it in connection with firm fixed price contracts may have a material adverse effect on its profitability.

These disruptions may result from many reasons, including closures of supplier facilities or critical manufacturing facilities due to strikes, mechanical breakdowns, electrical outages, fire, explosions, public health crises such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as well as logistical ----- complications resulting from weather or other natural disasters, mechanical failures and delayed customs processing. The lack of a subcomponent or raw material necessary to manufacture one of the Combined Group’s products could require the Combined Group to prolong its production period. Risks may also arise in the course of significant projects. These may include problems in contract design, the miscalculation of orders, changes in economic and technical conditions, flaws in project management or inadequate performance by subcontractors. Even when products are ready to be shipped, or have been shipped, delays may arise before they reach the Combined Group’s customer. When the Combined Group ceases timely deliveries, it has to absorb its own costs for identifying and solving the cause of the problem, as well as expeditiously producing and shipping replacement products.

The Combined Group is exposed to currency risk if a Combined Group company performs transactions and incurs future cash flows in a currency other than its functional currency. The Combined Group’s primary foreign currency exchange exposure is to the US dollar, the Swiss franc, the Japanese yen, the Chinese renminbi and the British pound. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could increase or reduce fluctuations in the prices of materials, since the Combined Group purchases a part of the raw materials which it sources with foreign currencies. As a result of these factors, fluctuations in exchange rates and, in particular a significant appreciation of the euro against other major currencies such as the US dollar, could affect the Combined Group’s results of operations. Material risks are hedged using currency forwards and options. Significant customer contracts in foreign currency are hedged. Currencies with high correlation to the euro, and equity investments or equity-type loans in foreign currencies, are only hedged in individual cases. In addition, there is hedging for planned sales revenue in foreign currency from series production business within defined hedging ranges and, occasionally, for customer projects whose materialization is highly probable. However, there can be no assurance that hedging will be available or continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms.

The Combined Group may make fewer sales to these customers for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to: - reduced demand for the Combined Group’s customers’ products, including, in particular, as a result of cyclical downturns that disproportionately affect the Combined Group’s customers’ industries; - loss of awarded business; - strikes or other work stoppages affecting production by the Combined Group’s customers; - reduced or delayed customer requirements; - bankruptcy or insolvency of a customer. Furthermore, the Combined Group’s customers may consolidate or merge from time to time. Consolidation among the Combined Group’s customers, or mergers of the Combined Group’s customers with entities that are not its customers, could result in an increasingly concentrated client base of large customers which could, among others, increase the bargaining power of the Combined Group’s current and future customers.

Therefore, any significant disruption or deterioration of our relationship with the US government would significantly reduce the Combined Group’s sales revenue and have an adverse impact on its business, financial condition and results of operations. The Target Business operates in highly competitive markets, and the US government may choose to use contractors other than the Target Business, for example as part of competitive bidding processes, or otherwise due to its competitors’ ongoing efforts to expand their business relationships with the US government. Some of the Target Business’s competitors have greater financial resources than it does and may have more extensive or more specialized engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than it does in some areas. The Target Business may not be able to continue to win competitively awarded contracts or to obtain task orders under multi-award contracts. The US government programs relevant to the Target Business must compete with programs managed by other government contractors and with other policy imperatives for consideration for limited resources and for uncertain levels of funding during the budget and appropriations process. Budget and appropriations decisions made by the US government are outside of the Target Business’s control and have long-term consequences for its business. US Government spending priorities and levels remain uncertain and difficult to predict and are affected by numerous factors, including sequestration (automatic, across-the-board US Government budgetary spending cuts) and potential alternative funding arrangements. A change in US Government spending priorities or an increase in non-procurement spending at the expense of programs relevant to the Target Business, or a reduction in total US Government spending, could have material adverse consequences on its current or future business.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

The Combined Group’s liquidity could also be adversely impacted if its suppliers were to suspend normal trade credit terms and require payment in advance or on delivery. If the Combined Group’s available cash flows from operating activities are not sufficient to fund its ongoing cash needs, the Combined Group would be required to look to its cash balances and availability for borrowings to satisfy those needs, as well as potential additional sources of capital, which may not be available on satisfactory terms, in sufficient amount or at all. There can be no assurance that the Combined Group, its suppliers or its customers will continue to have such ability. This may increase the risk that the Combined Group cannot produce its products or will have to pay higher prices for its inputs. These higher prices may not be recovered in our selling prices.

The Combined Group produces technologically complex products which must meet high quality standards and low tolerance ranges on account of their applications and the end-markets in which they are used. Products that have already been introduced in the market are subject to risks related to the product quality expected by customers. A decline in the actual or perceived quality of the Combined Group’s products and processes could damage the Combined Group’s image and reputation, including due to an inability to effectively implement the Combined Group’s business strategy. This can occur due to a variety of factors including problems in contract design, the miscalculation of orders, changes in economic and technical conditions, flaws in project management or inadequate performance by subcontractors. In addition, defective products could result in loss of sales, loss of customers and loss of market acceptance or could damage the Combined Group’s reputation and market perception, which, in turn, could have an adverse effect on the Combined Group’s sales and results of operations. Moreover, product or design defects or quality issues could result in costs to remedy or repair such defects or issues, which may not be covered by the Combined Group’s insurance policies and may require the Combined Group to establish provisions. Furthermore, the Combined Group’s customers could potentially bring claims for damages, even if the cause of the defect is remedied at a later point in time. As a manufacturer, the Combined Group is currently and may, in the future, also be subject to regulatory inquiries and consequent proceedings if necessary specifications and quality assurances in respect of its products are not met. In some countries, certain product certifications with regard to specifications and quality standards are necessary or preferred in order for these products to be accepted by customers and markets. As such, the Combined Group needs to be able to obtain and maintain the relevant certifications so that the Combined Group’s customers are able to sell products which include components that are manufactured by it in such countries. In addition, some customers also require the Combined Group to maintain certain standards and conduct inspections at regular intervals to ensure the Combined Group maintains these standards. Any failure to meet or maintain the requirements needed to secure or renew such certifications could result in a material adverse effect on the Combined Group’s business, financial conditions and results of operations. In addition, delivery capabilities and delivery performance represent a key competitive factor. The Combined Group’s products usually have a long implementation period. A failure by the Combined Group to meet contractual delivery dates could result in contractual penalties, expose the Combined Group to damage claims from its clients, lead to a loss of customers or negatively impact the Combined Group’s reputation.

The Combined Group’s Order Intake and Order Backlog only include expected sales under binding contracts with customers and binding purchase orders. However, there can be no assurance that these contractual terms would not change, or that the Order Intake or Order Backlog will result in an actual recognition of sales revenue within the period initially anticipated, if at all. The Combined Group may experience variances in the realization of its estimated Order Intake and Order Backlog because of delays or cancellations, scope adjustments, external market factors and economic factors beyond its control. If the estimated Order Intake or Order Backlog fails to materialize as anticipated, the Combined Group’s business, financial condition or results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. The Combined Group’s Order Intake and Order Backlog does not provide a precise indication of the time period over which the Combined Group is contractually entitled to generate such sales revenue and there is no assurance that such sales revenue will be actually generated in the time frames anticipated, or at all. Our Order Intake and Order Backlog are computed based on facts known and assumptions deemed appropriate at the computation date. ----- The Combined Group’s definition of Order Intake and Order Backlog may not necessarily be the same as that used by other companies engaged in activities similar to the Combined Group.

Due to the complexities and uncertainties associated with R&D, products that the Combined Group is currently developing may not complete the development process or obtain the regulatory approvals required for the Combined Group to market such products successfully. If the Combined Group devotes resources to the pursuit of new technologies and products that fail to be accepted in the marketplace or that fail to become commercially viable, all or part of these R&D costs may be lost. Furthermore, should the Combined Group be unable to secure sufficient funding to finance its R&D activities, the Combined Group could lose its competitive position in a number of important and rapidly growing sub-markets. The former RENK AG Group incurred as if €14,964 thousand in research and development costs (“R&D Costs”) in the twelve month period ended December 31, 2020 for the development of new and existing products and technology. In addition, the Group conducts similar research and development activities on an order-specific basis depending on its customers’ demands and needs. These costs are recognized within the Group’s cost of sales and are assigned to the respective customer order. These costs amounted to approximately 1.5 times the former RENK AG Group’s as if R&D Costs in the twelve month period ended December 31, 2020.

Decisions to purchase the Combined Group’s products are largely a result of the performance of these and other industries the Combined Group serves. If demand for output in these industries decreases, investments in new machinery decreases and subsequently the demand for the Combined Group’s products is also likely to decrease. Demand in these industries is impacted by numerous factors, including prices of commodities, interest rates, fuel costs, energy demands as well as economic growth. Increases or decreases in these variables globally may significantly impact the demand for the Combined Group’s products. The Combined Group’s business is characterized by high fixed costs. On the one hand, the Combined Group risks underutilization of it facilities if the markets in which it operates decline. An underutilization of the Combined Group’s facilities could result in idle capacity costs, write-offs of inventories and losses on products due to falling average sale prices. Furthermore, falling production volumes cause declines in sales revenue and earnings.

More generally, the loss of directors, executives, key employees and other skilled personnel could have a material adverse effect on the Combined Group’s market position. Due to intense competition within the industry, there is a risk of losing qualified employees to competitors or being unable to find a sufficient number of appropriate new employees. Considerable expertise could be lost or access thereto gained by competitors. There is no assurance that the Combined Group will be successful in retaining its executives and the employees in key positions or in attracting new employees with corresponding qualifications. Although the Combined Group tries to retain the commitment of its qualified executives and key employees through performancebased remuneration systems, there is a risk that any such individuals will leave the Combined Group, including as a result of negotiations of collective bargaining agreement on terms that may be regarded as below market standard by employees. ----- The success of the Combined Group’s operations and growth strategy will also depend on attracting and retaining skilled and unskilled personnel (including the need to identify, recruit, train and integrate additional employees) maintaining the Combined Group’s high quality standards and implementing its standardized process and quality management globally. The labor markets for production staff in some of the regions in which the Group is active, such as Germany, France, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States, were, at least prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, characterized by very low unemployment rates and strong employment growth, resulting in intense competition for qualified personnel and an increased turnover rate. In addition, the Target Business is a federal contractor for the purposes of affirmative action plan requirements, which could impose elevated staffing burdens on the Combined Group, including restrictions on the Target Business’ recruiting, hiring, promoting, terminating, and compensating employees as well as annual audit by the Office of Contract Compliance Programs and attendant exposure to potential damages for discrimination or other non-compliance with plan requirements.

Any failure in the operation of these IT systems could result in material adverse consequences, including disruption of operations, loss of information or an unanticipated increase in costs. In addition, from time to time, the Combined Group may be required to make investments to maintain and/or upgrade the Combined Group’s IT systems and networks and such investments may be significant. In addition, the Combined Group’s ability to keep its business operating depends on the proper and efficient operating and functioning of various IT systems which are susceptible to malfunctions and interruptions. Parts of the Combined Group’s IT infrastructure could malfunction as a result of accidents, disasters, technical disruption, internet attacks and a range of other hardware, software or network problems, thereby impairing or completely shutting down business processes. Moreover, there are the risks of unauthorized access, theft and the destruction or misuse of business data and information. A significant or large-scale malfunction or interruption of one or more of the Combined Group’s IT systems could adversely affect its ability to keep the Combined Group’s operations running efficiently or at all and affect product availability. In addition, it is possible that a malfunction of the Combined Group’s data security measures or a cyber-attack could enable unauthorized persons access to sensitive business or personal data, including information to its intellectual property or business strategy or those of its customers. As a business that is predominantly active in the defense industry, the Combined Group is a target of interest for governmental and non-governmental individuals and organizations. The Combined Group has in the past, and expects to continue to experience, attempts to compromise its IT systems with a view to accessing its data or otherwise interfering with its operations. While the Combined Group has not suffered any material loss of data or significant interruptions to its business operations to this date, such failure could cause economic loss for which the Combined Group could be liable and may expose the Combined Group to governmental investigations, disciplinary actions and fines.

Such risks arising from business interruption and loss of production are insured at levels considered economically reasonable by the Combined Group, but the Combined Group’s insurance coverage could prove insufficient in individual cases. Furthermore, such events could injure or result in the death of individuals or damage or destroy third party property or the environment, which could, among other things, lead to considerable financial costs for the Combined Group.

In addition, under federal and state environmental laws and regulations (including state property transfer laws), the Combined Group could be held responsible for the remediation of offsite areas impacted by the Combined Group’s sites and operations, natural resource damages, and/or third party claims (e.g., for bodily injury or property damage). Regulatory authorities could assert claims against the Combined Group, as the current or former owner or tenant (operator) of the affected sites or as the party that caused or contributed to the contamination, for the investigation or remediation or containment of such soil or groundwater contamination or other environmental media (e.g., surface waters), including related to the Combined Group’s use of non-owned treatment, storage and disposal sites or order the Combined Group to dispose of or treat contaminated soil excavated or water encountered in the course of construction. The Combined Group could also be liable to the owners or occupants of sites leased by the Combined Group, sites the Combined Group sells, or other impacted properties. Costs typically incurred in connection with such claims are generally difficult to predict. Also, if any contamination were to become a subject of public discussion, there is a risk that the Combined Group’s reputation or relations with its customers could be harmed.

This applies also to air, water and soil pollution regulations and to waste legislation and regulation, all of which have recently become more stringent through new laws, in particular, but not limited to, in the EU and the United States. Such laws and regulations also require permits, licenses and/or authorizations to be obtained and reports and forms to be completed and delivered, inter alia, to the competent authorities in connection with the operations of the Combined Group’s business. For example, for the Combined Group’s manufacturing facilities and operations, the Combined Group requires various permits and have to comply with the ----- requirements specified therein. This regulatory framework imposes on the Combined Group significant day-to-day compliance burdens, costs and risks. In the past, adjusting to new requirements has required significant investments and the Combined Group assumes that further significant investments in this regard will be required in the future. For instance, the Combined Group is subject to Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006 (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH)) and similar regulations under other applicable law which govern the production and use of chemicals. Several of the chemicals the Combined Group uses are or may be classified as substances of very high concern and are or could become subject to restrictions on use or become prohibited. If chemicals the Combined Group uses become subject to further restrictions on use or prohibited, the Combined Group must replace these substances, which may have a financial impact on the Combined Group’s business operations. Furthermore, the Combined Group’s operations are subject to laws and regulations designed to limit emissions. This is particularly relevant for the Combined Group’s sites that are located, mostly for historic reasons, in mixed-use areas with nearby residential properties, such as its site in Augsburg. In Germany, the construction and operation of coating facilities may depending on the production capacities, require a permit under the Federal Immission Control Act (Bundes-Immisionsschutzgesetz, “BImSchG”), which encompasses various approvals necessary for the construction and operation of facilities pursuant to other laws, including public-law approvals, registrations and consents. The operation of the relevant facility cannot generally be challenged or contested by third parties as long as the respective facility operates in compliance with its permit. In such cases, third parties can only require certain measures to mitigate any negative impact of a facility on the environment. To the extent such measures are impossible or uneconomical to implement based on state-of-the-art technology, the relevant third parties may only claim damages. Permits and additional administrative orders under the BImSchG may impose certain limitations (e.g., stricter requirements with regard to permissible emissions or the use of the relevant facilities), with which the Combined Group has to comply. The Combined Group’s German sites are subject to inspection requirements under the BImSchG and require certain permits under the BImSchG. Many of the Combined Group’s products are subject to comprehensive and constantly changing regulatory requirements that are not always homogeneous worldwide. These national and international regulations can impact the design, manufacture, marketing and sale of the Combined Group’s products and services and are subject to increasing governmental scrutiny and enforcement. In particular, violation of such laws and regulations (including, but not limited to, failure to timely renew the Combined Group’s licenses or comply with the conditions imposed by environmental authorities for the licenses to be valid and effective) may give rise to significant liability, including, but not limited to, fines and penalties, monetary and reputational damages, third party liabilities, limitations on the Combined Group’s business operations and site closures, and there can be no assurance that the Combined Group has been and will be in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment and human health, including but not limited to laws and regulations concerning occupational and employee health and safety. For example, in June 2019, the City of Augsburg requested remediation measures regarding a contamination of soil in the area of former oil and waste liquids tank. As of the date of this offering memorandum, the Group still has areas of contamination of soil and/or groundwater on the Group’s Augsburg plant, whereby the City of Augsburg is involved in the remediation and/or monitoring process. The Group expects the finalization of the key remediation and monitoring measures in 2022 (with the exception of a minor groundwater monitoring measure, which will continue beyond 2022). Moreover, certain areas of the Target Business’s real property in Muskegon, United States are subject to restrictive covenants under the Consent Decree. These covenants, among other things, require certain precautions to be taken in case of construction activity on the affected areas (e.g. with respect to the disposal of excavated soil) and limit the permitted use of the affected areas. The realization of any of these risks could have a material and adverse effect on the Combined Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

The GDPR imposed stricter conditions and limitations in relation to the processing, use and transmission of personal data. The GDPR introduced extensive documentation obligations and considerably higher transparency requirements, which affect not only initial data collection but also the monitoring and investigation once personal data has been collected. The Combined Group may not have prepared for these changes to the extent necessary and the Combined Group’s preparations may not yield the expected results. Additionally, although the Combined Group strives to comply with all applicable laws, regulations and legal obligations relating to data usage and data protection, it is possible that these laws, regulations and other obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with the Combined Group’s practices. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the Combined Group’s practices have complied, comply or will comply fully with all such laws, regulations and other legal obligations. For example, the Combined Group may have saved data from its customers that it should not have saved pursuant to applicable data protection laws. The Combined Group’s process of developing and advancing its data protection standards and procedures may take longer and require more resources than originally planned. Any non-compliance by the Combined Group with the applicable regulations could lead to fines and other sanctions. For example, the GDPR provides that violations can be fined, depending on the circumstances, by up to the higher of €20 million and 4% of the annual global turnover of the non-compliant company. The materialization of any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on the Combined Group’s business, financial condition or operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

Greenhouse gas emission laws and regulations have been promulgated in certain of the jurisdictions in which the Combined Group operates, and additional greenhouse gas requirements are in various stages of development. For example, the United States Congress has considered legislation that would establish a nationwide limit on greenhouse gases. In addition, the US Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has issued regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions from mobile and stationary sources pursuant to the US Clean Air Act. The final Carbon Pollution Standards for New, Modified and Reconstructed Power Plants reflect the degree of emission limitation achievable through the application of the best system of emission reduction that the EPA has determined has been adequately demonstrated for each type of unit. When effective, such measures could require the Combined Group to modify existing or obtain new permits, implement additional pollution control technology, curtail operations or increase the Combined Group’s operating costs. In addition, the Combined Group’s customers may seek price reductions from the Combined Group to account for their increased costs resulting from greenhouse gas requirements. Thus, any additional regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, including through a cap-and-trade system, technology mandate, emissions tax, reporting requirement or other program, could adversely affect the Combined Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, this could also have an impact on the Combined Group’s end-markets (particularly oil & gas). In the European Union, regulations attempt to both reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to establish a mechanism for trading in carbon dioxide emission allowances. Under the EU Emission Trading System (“ETS”), the overall availability of emission allowances allocated free of charge has been significantly reduced for the second trading and third trading periods (2008 through 2012 and 2013 through 2020). The quantity of such emission allowances are generally reduced from 80% of total allowances in 2013 to 30% in 2020. Starting with the third trading period, there are no longer any national allocation plans, but an EU-wide cap set by the European Commission and uniform allocation rules for all member states. Under the currently applicable ETS, the EU-wide cap is lowered annually by a linear factor of 1.74% of the average annual total quantity of emission allowances issued in the EU in the second trading period. Beginning in the fourth trading period (2021-3030), the cap has been lowered by 2.2% per year to achieve the target of cutting EU emissions by 40% of 1990 levels by 2030, as agreed upon by the European Council in October 2014 as part of the 2030 climate and energy framework. In addition, from 2013 onwards, the auctioning of emission allowances has been introduced for the manufacturing sector. Although the Combined Group has not been required to date to acquire emission allowances for the Group’s covered operations, as the amount of its emissions does not exceed the thresholds that cause the applicability ----- of the ETS, the Combined Group cannot predict with certainty whether those thresholds may not be decreased and/or what applicable thresholds in the future may be. If the Combined Group was required in the future to purchase emission allowances in the amount required for the Combined Group’s production purposes, it could have material adverse effect on the Combined Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

The process of seeking patent protection can be lengthy and expensive. Furthermore, patents may not be granted on currently pending or future applications or may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide the Combined Group with meaningful protection or a commercial advantage. In addition, while there is a presumption that patents are valid, the granting of a patent does not necessarily imply that it is effective or that possible patent claims can be enforced to the degree necessary or desired. Certain of the Combined Group’s existing patents convey a narrow scope of protection, including in terms of geographic reach and goods and services covered. Additionally, the Combined Group’s patents might have lapsed or expired. Further, the Combined Group’s competitors, suppliers, customers and other third parties also submit a large number of intellectual property protection applications. Such other parties could hold effective and enforceable intellectual property rights to certain processes, methods or applications and consequently could assert infringement claims (including illegitimate ones) against the Combined Group.

The objective of the due diligence process is to identify attractive investment opportunities based on the facts and circumstances of an investment, to identify possible risks associated with that investment. When conducting due diligence, the Group typically evaluates ----- a number of important business, financial, tax, accounting, environmental and legal issues in determining whether or not to proceed with an investment. Outside consultants, legal advisors, accountants and investment banks are involved in the due diligence process in varying degrees depending on the type of investment. Nevertheless, when conducting due diligence and making an assessment regarding an investment, the Group relies on resources available to it, including information provided by the target of the investment and, in some circumstances, third party investigations. Instances of bribery, fraud, accounting irregularities, contingent liabilities and other improper, illegal or corrupt practices can be difficult to detect, and fraud and other deceptive practices can be widespread in certain jurisdictions. There may be liabilities that the Group failed or was unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations into the Target Business in connection with the Acquisition. Following the Acquisition, the Group may learn of additional information about the Target Business that adversely affect the Target Business, such as unknown or contingent liabilities and issues relating to compliance with applicable laws.

Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 (the “Benchmarks Regulation”) applies, subject to certain transitional provisions, to the provision of benchmarks, the contribution of input data to a benchmark and the use of a benchmark within the EU (which, for these purposes, includes the United Kingdom). Among other things, it (i) requires benchmark administrators to be authorized or registered (or, if non-EU-based, to be subject to an equivalent regime or otherwise recognized or endorsed) and (ii) prevents certain uses by EU supervised entities of benchmarks of administrators that are not authorized or registered (or, if non-EU based, not deemed equivalent or recognized or endorsed). The Benchmarks Regulation could have a material impact on the Super Senior Facilities, if the methodology or other terms of the benchmark are changed in order to comply with the requirements of the Benchmarks Regulation. Such changes could, among other things, have the effect of reducing, increasing or otherwise affecting the volatility of the published rate or level of the relevant benchmark. More broadly, any of the international or national reforms, or the general increased regulatory scrutiny of benchmarks, could increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of a benchmark and complying with any such regulations or requirements.

These powers will permit the FCA to direct the LIBOR administrator to, amongst other things, change the LIBOR methodology to create what is being referred to as synthetic LIBOR. The FCA is not compelled to exercise these powers and the FCA is currently consulting on the circumstances in which it would consider doing so. Further, it is unlikely that the FCA would exercise these powers in relation to all LIBOR currencies.

The existence of such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements (including registration requirements), statutory liens or re-characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. The Collateral may be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. For example, it may be difficult for the Security Agent to sell the Combined Group’s assets in an enforcement scenario. The Security Agent may also need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. For example, pursuant to Sections 55 et seq. of the German Foreign Trade Regulation (Außenwirtschaftsverordnung) a purchase by a person not resident in the European Union of shares in a German company may under certain circumstances require an approval by the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Energy (Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie). Not obtaining such an approval may—depending on the character of the purchased company’s business—render the purchase provisionally invalid (schwebend unwirksam). The denial of the approval would either render the purchase permanently invalid or lead to additional obligations with respect to the relevant shares or the rescission (Rückabwicklung) of the purchase. The Security Agent may not be able to obtain any such consent. In addition, the consents of any third parties may not be given, when required, to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets.

The liens on the Collateral securing the Additional Notes and the Original Notes may not be perfected in terms of validity, enforceability, ranking or otherwise with respect to the claims of the Additional Notes or the Original Notes if the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Security Agent or any other third party fail or are unable to take the actions (e.g., as for filing, registration, modification or other requirements) required to perfect any of these liens. Absent perfection, the holder of the security interest may have difficulty enforcing such holder’s rights in the Collateral with regard to third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a ----- security interest in the same Collateral and some security interests do not actually create the purported security interest if not properly perfected. In addition, a debtor may discharge its obligation by paying the security provider until, but not after, the debtor receives a notification of the existence of the security interest granted by the security provider in favor of the security taken over the claims the security taker (as creditor) has against the debtor. In particular, the Federal Assignment of Claims Act 1940, as amended from time to time, provides that an assignment of claims with respect to certain United States government contracts will not become effective until a specified notice, executed by the security provider, has been duly provided to the relevent debtor. Under the Agreed Security Principles, the Issuer and the Guarantors are not required to comply with such notice requirement prior to an enforcement scenario. Therefore, such assignment may not be enforceable vis-à-vis the debtor until such notice has been provided. Additionally, the security provider and relevent debtor may amend or terminate the agreement subject to the assignment until such notice. Finally, since the ranking of pledges is sometimes determined by the date on which they became enforceable against third parties, a security interest created on a later date over the same Collateral, but which came into force for third parties earlier (by way of registration in the appropriate register or by notification) may have priority. Neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent has any obligation or responsibility to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute collateral or the perfection of, or to take steps or actions to perfect or ensure the perfection of, any security interest in the Notes against third parties.

In certain jurisdictions, including, among others, Germany, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests and enforceability of such security interests, the respective Collateral will secure a so-called “parallel debt” obligation (the “Parallel Debt Obligation”) created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent as well as, or in lieu of, securing the obligations under the Additional Notes directly. This parallel debt structure is used where certain jurisdictions have legal requirements relating to the creation and ongoing valid existence of security interests which are linked with the original secured claims and where certain actions under the finance documents, such as novation, may cause invalidity of the security interests under local law. The parallel debt is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Additional Notes and the related Guarantees (the “Principal Obligations”), and any payment with respect to the Principal Obligations will discharge the corresponding parallel debt and any payment with respect to the parallel debt will discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the Security Agent will have, pursuant to the parallel debt, a claim against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the full principal amount of the Additional Notes, the parallel debt structure has not been tested in court in these jurisdictions, including Germany, and there is no judicial guidance as to its efficacy or validity. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted, or the parallel debt structure might not be capable of creating a valid security interest on the part of the Security Agent. In addition, holders of the Additional Notes bear some risk associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent which could in particular, under certain circumstances, result in a delay in enforcement, diminishing value or even loss of the Collateral or Guarantees.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

Accordingly, the parity of the Additional Notes, the Original Notes, the obligations under the Super Senior Facilities Agreement, including the Cash RCF Facility and the L/G RCF Facility, and any other obligations secured by the Collateral will be implemented by way of the Intercreditor Agreement. As a result, the holders of the Additional Notes must rely on the effectiveness of the Intercreditor Agreement to implement parity among the holders of the Additional Notes and the other pari passu secured creditors, including the holders of the Original Notes and the lenders under the Super Senior Facilities Agreement. In the event that the Intercreditor Original Notes does not ensure parity on a contractual basis, the proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to repay the obligations under the Additional Notes. In addition, FinCo, the Issuer and certain of its subsidiaries will enter into new Security Documents over the Collateral to secure the indebtedness represented by the Additional Notes. For example, under German law, certain security interests (such as pledges over shares or bank accounts) granted under those new Security Documents will, because they are granted at a later point of time, rank behind the security interests securing the Original Notes and the Super Senior Facilities Agreement. However, pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Additional Notes will be treated and deemed to be secured by the Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Original Notes and the Super Senior Facilities Agreement. Therefore, the firstpriority right in the Collateral to be granted in favor of the holders of the Additional Notes will depend on the enforceability of the Intercreditor Agreement. If the Intercreditor Agreement or the relevant provisions thereof were found to be invalid or held to be unenforceable for any reason, or if an administrator refuses to give effect to it, the holders of the Additional Notes would not benefit from such first-priority treatment and the security interests granted in favor of the holders of the Additional Notes would rank behind, and be subordinated to, any prior-ranking security interests, including the security interests granted in favor of the holders of the Original Notes and the lenders under the Super Senior Facilities Agreement.

The Indenture also permits the Issuer to designate one or more restricted subsidiaries that are Guarantors as an unrestricted subsidiaries. If the Issuer designates a Guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture, all of the liens on the Collateral owned by such subsidiary and any guarantees of the Additional Notes and the Original Notes by such subsidiary will be released under the Indenture, subject to certain conditions. Designation of an unrestricted subsidiary as such will reduce the aggregate value of the Collateral securing the Additional Notes and the Original Notes to the extent of liens securing the shares of such unrestricted subsidiary or of its subsidiaries. See “Description of the _Notes—Security—Release of Liens.”_ Furthermore, under German law a secured party is, upon request by the relevant security grantor, obligated to release security if the realizable value of the security is significantly higher than the value of the obligations secured by such security.

In addition, upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a Change of Control, holders of the Notes may in certain circumstances require the Issuer to make an offer to purchase the Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued but unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the purchase date. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.” The Issuer may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to pay these amounts when they become due. The Issuer’s failure to repay holders tendering Notes, as applicable, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control event would result in an event of default under the Notes. The Issuer cannot assure you that it would have sufficient funds to repay its outstanding indebtedness that it would be required to prepay or offer to purchase or that became immediately due and payable as a result. The Issuer may require additional financing from third parties to fund any such purchases and the Issuer cannot assure you that it would be able to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all. Restrictions in the Issuer’s other then-existing contractual obligations may also restrict it from making such required repurchases. A Change of Control may result in an event of default under, or acceleration of the Issuer’s then-existing indebtedness, and the repurchase of the Notes, pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness even if the Change of Control itself does not. The Change of Control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transaction involving the Issuer that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “Change of Control” as defined in the Indenture. The definition of “Change of Control”contained in the Indenture includes a disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as whole. Although there is a limited body of case law in some jurisdictions interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole.

On October 5, 2020, the Issuer changed its legal form to a German stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft) under the name Rebecca BidCo AG. On February 15, 2021, the Issuer as surviving entity merged with the former Renk Aktiengesellschaft (“former RENK AG”) with retrospective effect as of January 1, 2020 and, as a result of such merger, acquired all assets and assumed all liabilities of the former RENK AG. On April 14, 2021, the Issuer changed its legal form to a German limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) under the name RENK GmbH. Prior to its merger with the former RENK AG, the Issuer was a holding company with no sales revenue-generating activities of its own, and did not have any business operations or material assets (other than its shareholding in the former RENK AG). The audited consolidated financial statements, including the related notes thereto, of the former RENK AG as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 (with comparative financial information as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018), included in this offering memorandum have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”) and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB). The audited consolidated financial statements of the former RENK AG as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, along with the independent auditor’s report (Bestätigungsvermerk des unabhängigen Abschlussprüfers) of PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (“PwC”) with respect thereto, and the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the former RENK AG as of and for the three month period ended March 31, 2020, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as applicable for interim financial reporting (IAS 34), are included in this offering memorandum. On February 15, 2021, the former RENK AG was merged into the Issuer (as the surviving entity) with retrospective effect as of January 1, 2020. Therefore, no historical consolidated financial information for the former RENK AG as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 is available. The Issuer did not prepare audited consolidated financial statements. In this offering memorandum, we therefore include audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the short fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 and unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements as of and for the three month period ended March 31, 2021 of RENK Holding GmbH. The short fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 of RENK Holding GmbH comprises the period from January 2, 2020 to December 31, 2020, and includes the operations of the former RENK AG Group only from the date of the consummation of the Renk Acquisition in October 2020. RENK Holding GmbH is a holding company with no sales revenue-generating activities of its own, and has not and does not expect to have any business operations, material assets or liabilities other than its shares in FinCo, the direct holding company of the Issuer. FinCo is a holding company with no sales revenue-generating activities of its own, and has not and does not expect to have any business operations, material assets or liabilities other than its shares in the Issuer The audited consolidated financial statements, including the related notes thereto, of RENK Holding GmbH as of and for the short fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, included in this offering memorandum have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB). The audited consolidated financial statements of RENK Holding GmbH as of and for the short fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, along with the independent auditor’s report of Ernst & Young GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (“EY”) with respect thereto, and the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of RENK Holding GmbH as of and for the three month period ended March 31, 2021, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as applicable for interim financial reporting (IAS 34), are included in this offering memorandum._ ----- _The consolidated financial statements of RENK Holding GmbH as of and for the short fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 include the operations of the former RENK AG Group only from the date of the consummation of the Renk Acquisition in October 2020 and on the basis of preliminary purchase accounting according to IFRS 3. Prior to that date, RENK Holding GmbH was a holding company without sales revenue- generating activities. The consolidated financial information of RENK Holding GmbH as of and for the short fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 included elsewhere in this offering memorandum is therefore not comparable to the consolidated financial information of the former RENK AG as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. For better comparability, the unaudited as if consolidated income statement and consolidated statement cash flows financial information for the former RENK AG for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2020 included in this offering memorandum therefore is presented as if the former RENK AG had not been merged into the Issuer with retrospective effect as of January 1, 2020 and had existed during the twelve month period ended December 31, 2020, and is derived from RENK Holding GmbH’s internal accounting and reporting systems. The unaudited as if financial information for the former RENK AG Group does not take into account the effects of the Original Transactions (including the related financing) on the Group.

In a subsequent squeeze-out procedure in terms of merger law the Issuer acquired the shares in the former RENK AG from the non-controlling shareholders (the “Squeeze Out”, and the acquisition of Rebecca BidCo AG of the shares of the former RENK AG, the Voluntary Public Takeover and the subsequent Squeeze Out collectively, the “Renk Acquisition”). Furthermore, RENK Holding GmbH via the Issuer and L3Harris Technologies, Inc. and L-3 Communications Holding GmbH entered into an asset and stock purchase agreement for the acquisition of the combat propulsion systems business of L3Harris Technologies, Inc. and all of the issued and outstanding ownership interests in L3 Magnet-Motor GmbH (collectively, the “Target Business”) (the “Target Business",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

The purpose of the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information is to illustrate the material effects (i) the consummated Renk Acquisition and (ii) the contemplated Target Business Acquisition would have had on the historical consolidated financial statements of RENK Holding GmbH if the RENK Holding GmbH Group had already existed in the structure created by the Renk Acquisition and the Target Business Acquisition as of January 1, 2020 with respect to the unaudited pro forma consolidated income statements and as of March 31, 2021 with respect to the unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of financial position. The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information is based on certain assumptions and is presented for illustrative purposes only. Due to its nature, the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information describes only a hypothetical situation and, therefore, does not purport to represent what the actual results of operations or financial position of the RENK Holding GmbH Group would have been if the Renk Acquisition and the Target Business Acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2020 with respect to the unaudited pro forma consolidated income statements or the Target Business Acquisition as of March 31, 2021 with respect to the unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of financial position, nor is it necessarily indicative of RENK Holding Group’s results of operations or financial position after the completion of the Target Business Acquisition. In addition, the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information is necessarily not indicative of RENK Holding GmbH’s future operating results or financial position. Therefore, RENK Holding GmbH Group’s actual results of operations and financial position after the completion of the Target Business Acquisition may differ significantly from those reflected in the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information. Furthermore, the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information is only meaningful in conjunction with RENK Holding GmbH’s historical consolidated financial statements as of and for the short fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 and unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements as of and for the three month period ended March 31, 2021.

The main area of differences was the useful life for buildings. The Target Business applied on an average 39 years, where RENK Holding GmbH applies 33 years. As of April 2, 2021, this adjustment leads to a lower carrying amount of property, plant and equipment in the amount of $589 thousand. _2.2.2.3.2 Leasing and asset retirement obligation provision_ The only material lease contract is covering the facility of the Target Business´ Magnet Motors.

The revalued right of use asset is amounting to $2,647 thousand and the lease liability to $2,690 thousand.

The Group’s products are, in many cases, mission-critical to its customers’ end-products and require high quality and reliability. As a result, the Group is a trusted supplier of premium products and is involved at all critical stages of its customers’ value chain, from engineering, to commissioning and aftermarket services. Long-term contracts in certain of its business units, in particular vehicle transmissions and Navy gearboxes provide stability of its sales revenue and operating profitability as well as a natural hedge during sudden economic downturns. In the twelve month period ended December 31, 2020, the former RENK AG Group generated as _if sales revenue of €550,207 thousand and as if Adjusted EBITDA of €86,098 thousand._ The Group operates through four business units: Vehicle Transmissions, Special Gear Units, Standard Gear Units and Slide Bearings. The Vehicle Transmissions business unit is one of the leading producers of fully automatic transmissions for medium- and heavy-weight tracked vehicles according to the Third Party Report as well as a producer of test rigs for various industrial end-markets. In 2019, the Group acquired the Horstman Group, a provider of armored vehicle suspension systems, which also added manufacturing capabilities in the United Kingdom and the United States in addition to this business unit’s existing production operations in Germany and France. In the twelve month period ended December 31, 2020, the Vehicle Transmissions business unit generated 43.3% of the former RENK AG Group’s as if total sales revenue and 71.0% of the former RENK AG Group’s as if operating profit (before inter-business unit consolidation). ----- The Special Gear Units business unit comprises of the production of large gear units, ranging from stationary gear units for a variety of industrial applications to high-speed gear units mainly for the oil & gas sector and complex gear units for fast ferries, mega-yachts and naval applications. According to the Third Party Report, the Group is a global leader in naval applications and gear systems for combined propulsion systems. In the twelve month period ended December 31, 2020, the Special Gear Units business unit generated 30.5% of the former RENK AG Group’s as if total sales revenue and 8.7% of the former RENK AG Group’s as if operating profit (before inter-business unit consolidation). The Standard Gear Units business unit specializes in the production of marine gearboxes for merchant ships, ferries, LNG/LPG tankers, and other specialty ships, as well as stationary gearboxes and couplings for energy generation, oil & gas, and other industrial applications. This business unit is a technology player with a market leading position for large single and twin engine marine gear units. In the twelve month period ended December 31, 2020, the Standard Gear Units business unit generated 12.5% of the former RENK AG Group’s _as if total sales revenue and 1.3% of the former RENK AG Group’s as if operating profit (before inter-_ business unit consolidation). The Slide Bearings business unit primarily supplies hydro-dynamically lubricated slide bearings used in electric motors, generators, pumps, blowers, water turbines, conveyors and marine applications. The Group believes it is the global leader in E-bearings for electrical machines with a global distribution network. In the twelve month period ended December 31, 2020, the Slide Bearings business unit generated 15.2% of the former RENK AG Group’s as if total sales revenue and 19.0% of the former RENK AG Group’s as if operating profit (before inter-business unit consolidation).

In addition, the Group benefits from positive secular trends in its key underlying markets. Spend for armored vehicles is expected to grow on the back of increasing geopolitical tensions and pressure on all NATO member states to increase their defense budgets to 2% of their respective GDP. The Navy market is expected to remain at current high levels. The Group’s civil marine and industrial end-markets are at or close to the bottom of their respective cycles and the Group therefore believes that these have limited further downside from cyclicality. In addition to new equipment sales, the Group generates a significant portion of its sales revenue from recurring aftermarket business (more than one third of its as if sales revenue of the former RENK AG Group) by leveraging the Group’s large and growing installed base across the entire product portfolio. The Group has a diverse and loyal customer base characterized by long-standing customer relationships with blue-chip OEMs, including Fincantieri, General Dynamics, GE, KMW, Lockheed Martin, Rheinmetall, and Siemens, as well as government agencies, primarily in the defense sector. Complex technological requirements, coupled with required customer credentials and reliability assurances for mission-critical products support customers’ loyalty to the Group as a trusted supplier and increase barriers to entry for new competitors. In addition, the Group’s strong focus on R&D, together with its fully-owned and well-invested modern production facilities, allow the Group to meet high customer requirements with respect to quality, reliability and delivery of customized solutions. ----- The Group’s competitive strengths are built on maintaining its leading technological positions in individual application areas, the Group’s global presence in its relevant markets and its high level of service quality tailored to the needs of international customers. Combining the individual strengths and product expertise of the Group’s individual business units enables the Group to realize synergies on large-scale projects. Headquartered in Augsburg, Germany, the Group operates seven production sites and 13 branch offices around the world. Its production sites are located in Germany (Augsburg, Rheine, Hanover), Switzerland (Winterthur), France (Saint-Ouen-l’Aumône), the United Kingdom (Bath) and the United States (Sterling Heights).

The Group’s solid sales revenue development has been a key driver of the Group’s gross profit for the period from the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 until the first quarter of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021. During any given period, the Group’s results of operations are affected by the mix of products sold in each business unit and the relative contribution of each business unit to the Group’s overall results. The Group’s results of operations depend on its ability to sell products to customers and to generate sales revenue from aftersales services (e.g., spare parts and maintenance and overhaul services), which typically generate higher margins. For example, from the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 to the twelve month period ended December 31, 2020, the Group’s sales revenue compared to the former RENK AG Group’s as if sales revenue increased by approximately 10%. While the Group’s new business sales revenue compared to the former RENK AG Group’s as if new business sales revenue increased by approximately 12% over the same period, the Group’s aftersales sales revenue compared to the former RENK AG Group’s as if aftersales sales revenue increased by approximately 4%. The Group’s significant exposure to the defense segment (vehicle transmissions and Navy gearboxes) and multiple end-markets in its industrial business provide a degree of stability during periods of economic downturns as well as recurring revenue due to the long-term nature of the contracts and life of the products. For example, in the twelve month period ended December 31, 2020, new product and aftermarket as if sales revenue, including intercompany revenue in the Group’s defense business generated more than half of the former RENK AG Group’s as if total sales revenue. Sales revenue in the Group’s industrial business accounted for the remaining part of the Group’s total sales revenues. While the relative share of new product and higher-margin aftersales revenue may fluctuate from year to year given the project nature of the Group’s business, the aftersales business, coupled with the long product life of many of the Group’s products, offers a degree of resiliency and revenue visibility.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

The Group believes that its technological innovation allows it to maintain market share for the Group’s business units, which, in turn, generates higher-margin new product sales and aftersales recurring sales revenue that can be reinvested into innovation and therefore renew the cycle. While the technology used in many of the Group’s products is well-established, the end-user market demands ongoing improvements and development of more specialized application-based products, which require considerable R&D efforts and expertise. The Group has made it its goal to maintain and expand its leading technological positions in key areas. R&D plays an ever more prominent role in this. Most of the products in the Group’s range have long lifecycles, so in addition to new developments within and outside the existing product lines, the Group’s innovation efforts mainly focus on progress that benefits customers. In the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, the former RENK AG Group incurred €13,069 thousand and €13,711 thousand respectively of R&D Costs under IFRS, presented within the cost of sales and in the twelve month period ended December 31, 2020 the former RENK AG Group incurred as if €14,964 thousand in R&D Costs under IFRS. In addition, the Group conducts similar research and development activities on an order-specific basis depending on its customers’ demands and needs. These costs are recognized within the Group’s cost of sales and are assigned to the respective customer order. These costs ----- amounted to approximately 1.5 times the former RENK AG Group’s as if R&D Costs in the twelve month period ended December 31, 2020, see “Business—R&D.”",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

As a significant part of the Group’s sales revenue is generated from long-term contracts, the COVID-19 pandemic and the various measures imposed by authorities around the world to contain its spread mainly had an impact on the Group’s service business due to travel restrictions and project delays at the Group’s customers. However, this impact gradually faded over the course of the twelve month period ended December 31, 2020. In addition, the Group implemented several measures to safeguard its operations and to minimize physical interaction (including social distancing measures, flexible working hours and minimizing travel).

This effect was only partially offset by lower current taxes as a result of the lower profit before taxes due to the factors described above. _Profit after tax/Profit after tax (share of RENK shareholders)_ Profit after tax decreased by €7,633 thousand, or 17.3%, from a profit after tax (share of RENK shareholders) of €44,171 thousand for the former RENK AG Group in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 to profit after tax of as if €36,538 thousand for the former RENK AG Group in the twelve month period ended December 31, 2020.

The increase was primarily attributable to the significant increase in sales revenue in the Vehicle Transmissions segment, including the consolidation of the operating business from Horstman from April 16, 2019. Vehicle Transmissions:_ Total sales revenue (before elimination of sales revenues between segments) generated by the Vehicle Transmissions segment increased by €52,620 thousand, or 29.6%, from €177,388 thousand in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 to €230,008 thousand in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to the first-time consolidation of Horstman in 2019. Sales revenue further increased as a result of the delivery of new transmissions, in particular for the PUMA and AJAX programs, and an increase in after-sales, in particular with respect to the HSWL 354 gear model used in the Leopard 2 tank and HSWL 256 (PUMA/AJAX). Special Gear Units:_ Total sales revenue (before elimination of sales revenues between segments) generated by the Special Gear Units segment increased by €10,589 thousand, or 6.2%, from €170,839 thousand in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 to €181,428 thousand in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to the high Order Intake in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. Sales revenue for stationary gears business in Augsburg was in line with the previous year, with the considerable upturn in industrial gear units offsetting the significant decline in mill gears. The marine gear business in Augsburg saw a new sales revenue increase slightly year on year. In addition to deliveries for the long-term procurement projects from the US Navy and US Coast Guard, initial deliveries for a larger project with the Indian Navy had a particular impact. Gear sets for a number of individual or small series projects were also delivered, including a mega-yacht. RENK-MAAG again generated sales revenue with third parties in line with the previous year in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. Standard Gear Units:_ Total sales revenue (before elimination of sales revenues between segments) generated by the Standard Gear Units segment decreased by €6,375 thousand, or 8.1%, from €78,885 thousand in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 to €72,510 thousand in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to the continued decline in wind turbines, which was only partly offset by an increase in couplings and marine gear units. Slide Bearings:_ Total sales revenue (before elimination of sales revenues between segments) generated by the Slide Bearings segment decreased by €1,835 thousand, or 2.1%, from €86,625 thousand in the fiscal year ----- ended December 31, 2018 to €84,790 thousand in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to declines in project business. _Cost of sales_ Cost of sales increased by €45,348 thousand, or 11.8%, from €383,442 thousand in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 to €428,790 thousand in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to higher sales revenue in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and the first-time consolidation of Horstman in 2019. _Other operating income_ Other operating income increased by €932 thousand, or 12.6%, from €7,418 thousand in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 to €8,350 thousand in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in income from exchange rate changes and derivatives of €2,563 thousand, from €1,623 thousand in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 to €4,186 thousand in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and income from costs charged on of €1,601 thousand in the fiscal year ended year ended December 31, 2019, which related to consulting services and internal costs related to the disposal of the equity investment in the former RENK AG by the Volkswagen Group (see also “— Other operating expenses”). This was partially offset by a decrease in income from reversal of provisions and prior-period income. _Distribution expenses_ Distribution expenses increased by €2,320 thousand, or 6.2%, from €37,412 thousand in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 to €39,732 thousand in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to higher staff costs and the consolidation of distribution expenses of Horstman. _General administrative expenses_ General administrative expenses increased by €5,178 thousand, or 23.2%, from €22,342 thousand in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 to €27,520 thousand in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to the consolidation of general administrative expenses of Horstman. Additional expenses occurred for building up own structures to replace central service functions previously rendered by the MAN Group. and the costs passed on by MAN SE for these services provided in 2019. _Other operating expenses_ Other operating expenses increased by €4,090 thousand, or 71.5%, from €5,721 thousand in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 to €9,811 thousand in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to higher expenses from exchange rate changes and derivatives as well as, to a lesser extent, the Horstman acquisition and the ancillary acquisition costs with it. It also includes the costs borne by the Target in the first phase of preparing to sell the equity investments in the former RENK AG by the Volkswagen Group; see also “— Other operating income.” _Interest expense_ Interest expense increased by €428 thousand, from €400 thousand in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 to €828 thousand in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in interest cost on provisions and liabilities which include interest expenses from lease liabilities in the amount of €126 thousand. Those were recognized for the first time in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 due to the mandatory regulations under IFRS 16—Leases having been applied for the first time in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. _Other financial result_ Other financial result increased by €926 thousand, or 51.4%, from €1,802 thousand in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 to €2,728 thousand in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to income from reversals of impairment losses for two equity investments of €2,021 thousand in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 compared to no such income in the December 31, 2018. This was partially offset by a decrease in the income from dividends of €1,280 thousand, from €1,979 thousand in the fiscal year December 31, 2018 to €699 thousand in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. ----- _Income tax expense_ Income tax expense decreased by €953 thousand, or 5.0%, from €19,105 thousand in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 to €18,152 thousand in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to a lower tax rate of 29.1% in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 compared to a tax rate of 31.0% in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. The tax rate results from the respective income tax rates for the domestic and foreign subsidiaries and from prior-period and deferred taxes. _Profit after tax (share of RENK shareholders)_ Profit after tax (share of RENK shareholders) increased by €1,661 thousand, or 3.9%, from €42,510 thousand in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 to €44,171 thousand in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019.

The decrease was primarily attributable to a strong rise in working capital commitments. The primary cause of this was the decline in existing prepayments received, related to sales revenue, and the relatively smaller inflow from new projects compared to 2018. _Cash flows from investing activities Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 RENK Holding GmbH Group Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2020 former RENK AG Group_ Cash flows from investing activities increased by €2,877 thousand from a cash outflow of €7,742 thousand for the former RENK AG Group in the three months ended March 31, 2020 to a cash outflow of €4,865 thousand for the RENK Holding GmbH Group in the three months ended March 31, 2021.

Due to the Group’s significant cash balances and the low interest rate environment, the Group has not historically prioritized the optimization of its net working capital. The Group’s strategy around net working capital was historically centered around and impacted by the following areas: - Inventories: - The strengthening of the Group’s competitive position by enabling shorter delivery times (particularly in the Slide Bearings business unit) which led to increasing stock levels; - The realization of selective cost savings through bundling of order volumes (i.e., significant inventory purchases at the beginning of projects vs. throughout projects); and - Conservatism in ensuring the Group’s ability to produce at all times through high stock levels (particularly in the Vehicle Transmissions business unit). - Customer Receivables: - The implementation of an effective receivables management system in recent years; and - Significant year-end effects in 2018 and 2019 due to a project-related revenue concentration in November and December. - Trade Payables: - Establishing a clear goal to conduct early payments to realize cash discounts. - Prepayments (received) - The development of prepayments is project driven and mainly in the defense business; and - Unusually high prepayments realized in the Vehicle Transmissions business unit for one large project in recent past. Following its acquisition by the Sponsor, the Group, with the support of an external advisor, has identified several net working capital initiatives aimed at decreasing the Group’s working capital needs. The Group estimates that certain measures, including those detailed above, if fully implemented, have the potential to result in a double-digit million reduction of its net working capital requirements. The Group started to implement the first measures in its Augsburg facility in 2020 and believes that they have contributed to the reduction in net working capital as of December 30, 2020 and March 31, 2021. The Group plans to roll-out these measures at other facilities going forward. Net working capital as of March 31, 2021 amounted to €129,592 thousand compared to €145,727 thousand as of December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in customer receivables of €22,677 thousand from €125,346 thousand as of December 31, 2020 to €102,669 thousand as of March 31, 2021 as a result of lower customer receivables, particularly in the Vehicle Transmissions and Special Gear Units business units partially due to improved working capital management and an increase in prepayments (received) due to strong Order Intake in the Vehicle Transmissions business unit with favorable contract terms. These effects were only partially offset by higher inventories in the Special Gear Units business unit due to the postponement of some projects. Net working capital as of December 31, 2020 amounted to €145,727 thousand compared to €180,302 thousand as of December 31, 2019. The decrease was driven by lower customer receivables partially due to improved working capital management, in particular in the Special Gear Units business unit and an increase in prepayments (received) due to strong order intake for marine gear units with favorable payment terms, which was only partially offset by higher inventories in the Special Gear Units business unit due to project postponements. Net working capital as of December 31, 2019 amounted to €180,302 thousand compared to €119,587 thousand as of December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to the consolidation of Horstman ----- as well as increases in inventories and customer receivables. The increase in inventories was largely driven by project-related increases for Naval and stationary applications in the Special Gears unit and related to a bundling approach for selected cost savings and safeguarding delivery times. The increase in customer receivables was mainly due to a year-end effect where customer payments were only received in the beginning of 2020.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, capital expenditures (comprising payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and intangible assets) amounted to €5,590 thousand and related mainly to continuing investments at the Augsburg site. The Group continued to invest to expand capacity of the Vehicle Transmissions business in Augsburg, which is expected to be completed in 2021. For the twelve month period ended December 31, 2020, capital expenditures amounted to as if €38,491 thousand for the former RENK AG Group and mainly related to investments at the Augsburg site. Further investments were made in machinery and test rigs for the Vehicle Transmissions business unit. Investments in the Special Gear Units business unit related to new production equipment. In the Slide Bearings business unit in Hanover, investment activities focused on new coating equipment. In the Standard Gear Units business unit in Rheine, capital expenditures related primarily to milling and turning equipment and completion of the new customer center featuring modern meeting and seminar rooms. The Group’s French subsidiary focused its capital expenditures on testing facilities, whereas RENK-MAAG and the Horstman Group primarily invested in the refurbishment of mechanical production equipment. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, capital expenditures amounted to €33,331 thousand for the former RENK AG Group and mainly related to continuing investments at the Augsburg site, the construction of a new logistics center in Oberottmarshausen and construction work for a new production hall, as well as continuing investments in the project to expand capacity of the Vehicle Transmissions business, which is expected to be completed in 2021. Investments were also made in machinery and existing test rigs. Special Gear Units business focused on the renewal of gear grinding technology and the optimization of test rig equipment. In the Slide Bearings business in Hanover, investing activities centered around new coating equipment. In the Standard Gear Units business in Rheine, capital expenditures related primarily to milling and turning centers. Another area of focus was on the construction of a customer center in Rheine. After completing the extensive modernization work at the French subsidiary, the focus in the fiscal year turned to investment for refurbishing the testing facilities. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, capital expenditures amounted to €35,361 thousand for the former RENK AG Group and mainly related to continuing investments at the Augsburg site and the construction of a new logistics center in Oberottmarshausen. Activities in the Special Gear Units focused on continuing the restructuring and renewal of gear grinding technology and the optimization of assembly processes. Vehicle Transmissions also focused on the reorganization and optimization of assembly processes, and on redesigning and expanding parts of mechanical production, including in particular housing processing facilities. In Rheine, at the Standard Gear Units site, capital expenditures focused on the renewal and optimization of the mechanical production machinery. At the Hanover Slide Bearings site, the focus was still on optimizing surface coating facilities. RENK France completed its extensive, long-term modernization and renovation of the building infrastructure for production, technology, administration and distribution. Work also began to replace the testing facilities.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

IFRS 16 amended the provisions for accounting for leases and superseded the previous Standard IAS 17 and its associated interpretations. The central objective of IFRS 16 is the recognition of all leases in the statement of financial position. Accordingly, lessees will no longer distinguish between finance and operating leases. Instead, they must recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases in their statement of financial position. In the Group, the lease liability is measured using the outstanding lease payments discounted at the incremental borrowing rate, while the right-of-use asset is measured at the moment of the lease liability. Here, the option is exercised to exclude initial direct costs at the date of initial application. During the term of the lease, the right-of-use asset must be amortized and the lease liability must be carried forward using the effective interest method and taking lease payments into account. IFRS 16 allows practical expedients used by the Group for short-term and low-value leases, and therefore right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are not recognized for such leases. These lease payments continue to be recognized as expenses in the income statement. At the time of adoption, leases ending before January 1, 2020 were classified as current leases regardless of when they began. As of January 1, 2019, the Group accounted for leases using the modified retrospective transition method in accordance with IFRS 16 for the first time in its consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. The prior-year comparison figures for 2018 were not adjusted in its consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. Under this method, the lease liability must be recognized at the present value of the outstanding lease payments as of the transition date. The present value is calculated based on incremental borrowing rates as of January 1, 2019. The weighted average interest rate for this in the Group was 2.1%. The leases essentially include office and warehouse space and vehicles. The normal lease term is between one and five years. By way of simplification, the right-of-use assets are recognized at the amount of the respective lease liability adjusted for any prepaid or accrued lease payments. Right-of-use assets were not tested for impairment as of the adoption date as there was no evidence of impairment on operating leases as of December 31, 2018. The right-of-use assets shown in the statement of financial position are reported in those statement of financial position items in which the assets to which the lease relates would have been reported if the Group had owned them. The right-of-use assets are therefore reported under non-current assets in property, plant and equipment as of the end of the reporting period. The first-time recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities gave rise to the following effects as of January 1, 2019: - Right-of-use assets of €5,182 thousand were recognized under property, plant and equipment in the opening statement of financial position. ----- - Lease liabilities of €5,182 thousand were reported under current and non-current financial liabilities. - Adoption had no effect on equity. The difference between expected payments for operating leases of €4,907 thousand discounted using the incremental borrowing rate as of December 31, 2018 and the lease liabilities of €5,182 thousand recognized in the opening statement of financial position essentially results from the reassessment of lease terms in accordance with IFRS 16. Reasonably certain extension or termination options were taken into account in determining the lease payments to be capitalized. In addition, lease payments for low-value and short-term leases are not included in lease liabilities in the opening statement of financial position. Unlike under the previous approach, where expenses for operating leases were shown in full in operating profit, under IFRS 16 only the amortization of rights of use is shown in operating profit. Interest expenses on lease liabilities are reported in the financial result. This improved the operating profit by €179 thousand in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. The change in the recognition of operating lease expenses in the statement of cash flows resulted in an improvement in cash flow from operating activities of €1,076 thousand as of December 31, 2019. Cash outflows from financing activities increased accordingly. The increase in financial liabilities resulting from the change in accounting policies had a negative impact of €6,345 thousand on the former RENK AG Group’s net liquidity as of December 31, 2019. For further details on the impact on specific financial statement line items please refer to Note 3 and 5 within the consolidated financial statements of the former RENK AG as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

To reduce the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, the Group continuously quantifies the exchange risk and hedges material risks by using currency forwards and options. In the Group, all firm customer contracts, its own orders, receivables and liabilities in foreign currency are hedged. Currencies with a high correlation to the euro, such as the Danish krone, and equity investments or equity-type loans in foreign currencies, if at all relevant, are only hedged in individual cases. In addition, there is hedging for planned sales revenue in foreign currency from series production business within defined hedging ranges and, occasionally, for customer projects whose materialization is highly probable. The managing directors are regularly informed of the currency positions of the Group. As of the end of 2020, foreign exchange exposure was primarily from transactions in USD, CHF, JPY, CNY and GBP.

Credit risks include direct counterparty risk and the risk of a deterioration in credit quality. The maximum credit risk is reflected by the carrying amounts of financial assets reported in the statement of financial position. Credit risks are minimized, and risk provisions calculated, mainly with the following measures: Sovereign and counterparty risks arising from business operations are continuously assessed locally. Security levels and forms are determined based on this. Outstanding debts are also continuously monitored locally. If default risks arise, allowances are recognized. Credit risk is limited by various, sometimes country-specific, forms of security. Letters of credit, credit insurance, guarantees, warranties, retention of title and customer prepayments are used. In project business, the risk of default is minimized by prepayments and by obtaining collateral. The Group recognizes loss allowances for expected credit losses in connection with its business operations. The Group also performs an ongoing assessment of all financial assets measured at amortized cost. Allowances on trade receivables and contract assets are calculated using a provision matrix with provision rates graded according to the aging analysis of receivables. Specific valuation allowances are recognized if there is objective evidence of credit losses or other contractual anomalies. Other financial receivables and cash and cash equivalents are checked for cash shortfalls using a general three-stage approach. There were no significant clusters in terms of credit risk in the Group in the short fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.

Cash for the operating units is essentially managed centrally as part of cash pooling. Cash and cash equivalents of the Group companies are combined on a daily basis. Thus, liquidity surpluses and requirements can be managed as necessary. For external financing, the opportunities on the financial markets are tracked continuously to ensure financial flexibility and to limit refinancing risks. In the context of a syndicated loan agreement, the Group agreed with banks cash credit lines for €50,000 thousand at normal market conditions with a term to January 13, 2025 and an extension option. As of December 31, 2020, the cash credit line was undrawn. In addition, in the framework of a syndicated loan agreement, the Group has a guarantee credit line of €175,000 thousand, €120,889 thousand of which was utilized as of December 31, 2020. There are also additional guarantee credit lines on a bilateral basis of €23,988 thousand, €21,981 thousand of which were utilized as of December 31, 2020.

The estimates were made on the basis of past experience and other relevant factors, including the assumption of going concern. All estimates and assumptions are made to the best of knowledge and belief to provide a true and fair view of the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the Group. Any uncertainty is adequately reflected in valuations, although future events can still differ from these estimates and have a material effect on the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the Group. Estimates and judgments are reviewed on an ongoing basis. The assumptions made regarding the following matters as of the end of the reporting period are of particular significance: If intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets, other equity investments and financial investments, other receivables or goodwill are tested for impairment, this requires a forecast of future cash flows for the calculation of the recoverable amount and their discounting, among other things. Such cash flows are based on forecasts that are in turn based on the business and financial planning approved by the management. Other material assumptions relate to the weighted average cost of capital and tax rates. Estimates of the useful life of depreciable assets are based on past experience. If, in the context of the review of useful life, a change is made in estimates, the remaining useful life is adjusted and any impairment loss is recognized. Recognizing the leases in the form of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability requires estimates on the lease term of the relevant lease components. It must be assessed whether it is reasonably certain that the contractually agreed extension, termination and call options will be exercised. The estimate for the initial recognition of the lease components determines the amount of the lease liability and thus the right-of-use asset. Changes to the estimate in subsequent periods result in a change to the residual values of statement of financial position items related to leases. When control of an asset is transferred to the customer, the entity satisfies its performance obligation and the corresponding sales revenue can be recognized. The asset comprises contractually agreed goods and services. At contract inception it is determined whether the performance obligation is satisfied over time. If the requirements for this are not met, the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time. Assurance-type warranties must be taken into account in performance obligations. Performance obligations are recognized over time in the following cases: - The services rendered that benefit the customer are consumed by the customer at the same time that the services are rendered. - The assets created or processed are controlled by the customer during performance by the entity. - The assets created have no alternative use for the entity and the entity has an enforceable right to payment by the customer for the performance completed to date. Individual performance obligations are accounted for over time using the percentage of completion method. Sales revenue is accounted for using the percentage of completion method. This method places considerable importance on accurate estimates of the percentage of completion. Depending on which method is used to determine the percentage of completion, significant estimates include contract revenue, total contract costs, the remaining costs to completion, contract risks and other assessments. The management of the operating units is continuously reviewing the estimates for such performance obligations and adjusts them as necessary. Estimates, especially for variable remuneration components, are required to calculate the transaction price as the expected consideration in exchange for the transfer of goods and services. The variability relates to the claim actually arising and to the amount of the claim. The single most likely amount in a range of possible contractual consideration amounts is selected as the most likely amount. In addition, some or all of the variable consideration component is only included in the transaction price to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal of the revenue recognized will not occur. This assessment of probabilities and the restriction of variable remuneration components is based on management estimates. Determining impairment of financial assets requires estimates of the level and probability of occurrence of future events. As far as possible, estimates are derived from past experience. Pensions and similar obligations are measured using actuarial methods. These are mainly based on assumptions relating to discount rates, salary and pension trends and mortality. These actuarial assumptions can differ significantly from actual developments due to changes in market and economic conditions and therefore lead to a substantial change in pensions and similar obligations. ----- As the Group operates in several countries, it is subject to different tax laws. The expected current income taxes and the deferred tax assets and liabilities must be calculated for each taxable entity. This requires, among other things, assumptions about the interpretation of complex tax regulations and the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the respective tax type and jurisdiction. If these assumptions differ from the actual outcome of such tax uncertainties, this can affect tax expenses and deferred taxes. The best estimate of the expected tax payment is used for recognized uncertain income tax positions. Depending on the matter at hand, the measurement of other provisions and similar obligations is complex at times and entails estimates to a considerable extent. The assumptions made by management with respect to the timing and amount of utilization are based, among other things, on historical data, available technical data, estimates of cost trends and potential warranty claims, discount rates and possible recoverable amounts. Litigation and other legal proceedings simultaneously give rise to complex legal issues and are subject to many difficulties and uncertainties. A provision is recognized for this if it is likely that, in connection with these proceedings, a liability has been incurred that will probably lead to an outflow of resources and its amount can be reliably estimated. Assessing whether a present obligation as of the end of the reporting period is as a result of a past event, whether a future outflow is likely and whether the obligation can be estimated reliably requires considerable judgment and significant estimates by management. Future events and developments as well as changes in estimates and assumptions can lead to an amended assessment at a future date. Additional expenses that can have a material effect on the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the Group thus cannot be completely ruled out. Changes in contractual or actual circumstances are monitored and assessed as regards the potential impact on the amount and reporting of the recognized assets and liabilities, income and expenses and information on contingent assets and liabilities in the reporting period. Developments in these general conditions that deviate from assumptions and are beyond management control can cause amounts to differ from the original estimates. With the approval of the extraordinary stockholders’ meeting for the squeeze-out under merger law and the filing of the merger in the commercial register on December 22, 2020, the conditions were met for accounting the merger of the former RENK AG, Augsburg, and the former Rebecca BidCo AG, Munich, and the squeezeout. As a result, as of this date, a financial liability to the minority stockholders in the amount stipulated in the squeeze-out opinion were recognized instead of the minority interest. The amount currently recognized represents the best estimate as of December 31, 2020. The financial liability recognized may still change as a result of the court proceedings. The merger of former RENK AG into former Rebecca BidCo AG triggers real estate transfer tax for the formers RENK AG’s real property.

The consolidated financial information as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively, as well as for the three month period ended March 31, 2020 contained in the following section is taken or derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of the former RENK AG as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 (with comparative financial information as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018), and the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the former RENK AG as of and for the three month period ended March 31, 2020 which are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum, as well as from the former RENK AG’s internal accounting or reporting systems. The audited consolidated financial statements of the former RENK AG as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB). The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the former RENK AG as of and for the three month period ended March 31, 2020 have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as applicable for interim financial reporting (IAS 34). On February 15, 2021, the former RENK AG was merged into the Issuer as the surviving entity with retrospective effect as of January 1, 2020. Therefore, no historical consolidated financial information for the former RENK AG as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 is available. The Issuer does not prepare audited consolidated financial statements. In this offering memorandum, we therefore have include audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the short fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 and unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements as of and for the three month period ended March 31, 2021 of RENK Holding GmbH. The short fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 of RENK Holding GmbH comprises the period from January 2, 2020 to December 31, 2020 and includes the operations of the former RENK AG Group only from the date of the consummation of the Renk Acquisition in October 2020. RENK Holding GmbH is a holding company with no sales revenue-generating activities of its own, and has not and does not expect to have any business operations, material assets or liabilities other than its shares in FinCo, the direct holding company of the Issuer. FinCo is a holding company with no sales revenue-generating activities of its own, and has not and does not expect to have any business operations, material assets or liabilities other than its shares in the Issuer. The audited consolidated financial statements of RENK Holding GmbH as of and for the short fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB). The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of RENK Holding GmbH as of and for the three month period ended March 31, 2021 have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as applicable for interim financial reporting (IAS 34). The consolidated financial statements of RENK Holding GmbH as of and for the short fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 include the operations of the former RENK AG Group only from the date of the consummation of the Renk Acquisition in October 2020 and on the basis of preliminary purchase accounting according to IFRS 3. Prior to that date, RENK Holding GmbH was a holding company without sales revenue- generating activities. The consolidated financial information of RENK Holding GmbH as of and for the short fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 included elsewhere in this offering memorandum is therefore not comparable to the consolidated financial information of the former RENK AG as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. For better comparability, the unaudited as if income statement and statement of cash flows financial information for the former RENK AG Group for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2020 included in the following section therefore is presented as if the former RENK AG had not been merged into RENK GmbH with retrospective effect as of January 1, 2020 and had existed during the twelve month period ended December 31, 2020, and is derived from RENK Holding GmbH’s internal accounting and reporting systems. The unaudited as if financial information for the former RENK AG Group does not take into account the effects of the Original Transactions (including the related financing) on the Group. The financial information with respect to the consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2020 presented in this section_ ----- _is taken or derived from RENK Holding GmbH’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the short fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.

From January 1, 2019, the former RENK AG applied IFRS 16 Leases for the first time in its consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 which had an impact on its reported consolidated income statement, as well as consolidated statements of financial position and presentation of cash flows. In implementing IFRS 16, the former RENK AG selected the modified retrospective approach as the transition method, which means that the comparison figures for 2018 are not restated in its consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, and thus not comparable. In order to facilitate a comparison between periods, the details of the income statement and statement of financial position items affected by the implementation of IFRS 16 are summarized in “— Accounting Standards Adopted from the Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2019.” The following discussion should be read in conjunction with “Selected Financial Information” and the former RENK AG’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 (with comparative financial information as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018) as well as RENK Holding GmbH’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the short fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, in each case including the related notes thereto, as well as the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the former RENK AG as of and for the three month period ended March 31, 2020 and the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of RENK Holding GmbH as of and for the three month period ended March 31, 2021, in each case including the related notes thereto, contained elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

364,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,165,INDUSTRY AND COMPETITION,165.1,Group Target Business Defense Civil/Industrial Defense Civil/Industrial,165.1.1,Vehicle Transmissions,"The Vehicle Transmissions business unit generated as if €238.2 million of sales revenue (before inter-business unit consolidation) for the former RENK AG Group in the twelve month period ended December 31, 2020, focusing on fully automatic transmissions for medium- and heavy tracked vehicles, suspension systems for armored vehicles and test rigs for various industrial end-markets. ----- _Transmission market_ A significant growth in the addressable defense markets is expected due to increasing defense budgets and the armies’ general need for modernization of vehicle fleets. The transmissions market for both new transmission units and aftermarket offerings in the Group’s and the Target Business’s addressable geographies is attractive with an estimated volume of approximately €500 million according to the (pre COVID-19) Third Party Report. The same report estimates the addressable market to grow at approximately 10 to 11% per annum until 2024. Key highlights: - The overall defense market is in the middle of a “super-cycle,” triggered by increasing global political tensions and increasing pressure on all member states to match NATO’s defense spend target of 2% of GDP; - Governments around the world have been delaying necessary investments in their fleet in the recent past. Aging military fleets and long order times of new platforms directly lead to higher maintenance requirements / spend in the future—a trend which already positively impacts sales revenue of both the Group and Target Business; - Technological advancements have widened the range of armored vehicles currently being developed and produced and thereby support the overall growth momentum. Active protection systems and artificial intelligence, mainly used for vehicle autonomy and predictive maintenance, are some of the latest technological developments; and - The acquisition of the Horstman Group in 2019 adds new manufacturing capabilities (suspension systems) and provides access to additional growth markets in the UK and US, while also increasing exposure to the wheeled armored vehicle segment; and - The acquisition of the Target Business in 2021 provides the Group with access to the multi-billion armored vehicle market in the US which has been a white-spot for the Group’s transmissions business so far. In addition, the acquisition expands the Group’s product portfolio in medium -weight transmissions for US, Israeli and other NATO(-allied) government customers and hence also expands the overall addressable profit pool. The estimates and assumptions above including the growth target are expected to remain unchanged throughout the COVID-19 pandemic as (i) the Group and the Target Business experienced continuously high demand from strong pipelines throughout the pandemic, (ii) select countries announced plans to intensify their spending for defense projects as a reaction to boost GDP and (iii) certain military conflicts continue to emerge (e.g. Israel). The Group is a leading player in transmissions for tracked vehicles in currently served geographies as the Group is perceived as best-in-class for innovation, high reliability and quality, particularly in harsh conditions (e.g., the desert). Other market participants include Ashot, ST Engineering, Allison Transmission, SAPA, David Brown Santasalo, General Kinetics and, in the future potentially, ZF. Going forward, the Group and the Target business are well placed to retain and expand their market share in addressed geographies given the strong technical know-how, deep and long-standing customer relationships and being the single-source transmission supplier in various projects. Changes to the technical and localization requirements in the US combined with the acquired US footprint of the Target Business and the potential for select technology transfers between both businesses allow the Group to strengthen its strategic positioning for upcoming projects. This is expected to include the planned the multi-billion dollar Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (“OMFV”), which is part of the Next Generation Combat Vehicles (“NGCV”) program of the US Army. As of April 2020, the US Army has set out a phased approach for contracting for and acquisition of OMFVs with first deliveries planned for 2027/28. The Target Business is currently supplying most of the major tracked vehicle platforms of the US Army with its transmissions and engines (e.g. Bradley, AMPV, PIM, M88 Series, etc.) and is committed to continue the trusted relationship on new and legacy vehicle platforms over the long-term and far beyond the NGCV program. _Engine market_ Through the acquisition of the Target Business, the Group expands its drive train product portfolio by engines for tracked defense vehicles. The Target Business is a leading manufacturer of engines for medium- and heavy tracked vehicles for the US Army and international customers with a significant installed base globally. ----- The engine market for both new units and aftermarket offerings in the Group’s and the Target Business’s addressable geographies is closely related to the transmission market from a size and growth perspective, with both products together being the core of the vehicle’s drive train. One specific trend which can be observed in this market over the last few years is the increasing demand for higher horsepower engines. The Target Business is advanced and dedicated to address this need with a technological advancement to its existing engine (electric fuel injection upgrade). Another mid- to long-term trend in the engine market is an increased use of hybrid or electric engines given the use of more complex electronic systems. In addition, hybrid systems can provide more power in total, reduce the space used for the combustion engine and allow for silent movement of a vehicle when only electric drive is used. Please refer to the Transmission market section above for further market trends. These are applicable for both, the transmission and engine markets, and are driven by underlying defense programs.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511
364,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,165,INDUSTRY AND COMPETITION,165.1,Group Target Business Defense Civil/Industrial Defense Civil/Industrial,165.1.2,Special Gear Units,"The Special Gear Units business unit generated as if €168.0 million of sales revenue (before inter-business unit consolidation) for the former RENK AG Group in the twelve month period ended December 31, 2020, serving a broad range of end-markets including Navy (gearboxes for large surface vessels for public authorities such as corvettes, frigates and offshore patrol vessels), civil marine (gearboxes for fast ferries and mega-yachts), oil & gas / conventional power generation (high-speed stationary gearboxes), plastics (e.g., extruder gearboxes) and cement (e.g., mill gearboxes). _Navy gearbox market_ The Group manufactures complex gear units primarily used in defense applications (i.e., corvettes, frigates and offshore patrol vessels) as well as gear units used in civil marine applications (i.e., mega-yachts and fast ferries) with high technological requirements such as high power, low noise and low vibration. The Navy market is attractive with an order value of commissioned Navy vessels in the Group’s currently and additionally addressable geographies representing an order value of the complete vessels of approximately €18 billion in 2019. 2020 was expected to see a decrease as specific larger vessel programs in some of the addressed markets reach their final deliveries, but new programs are gradually ramping-up again thereafter. The same report estimates this market to grow by approximately 5-6% per annum from the 2019 base to approximately €23 billion in 2024. The value share of gear boxes in completed vessels varies by type of vessel. Key highlights: - Strong international demand for new shipbuilding programs as reflected by the number of orders in the Group’s addressable market (especially Germany, the USA, India, and South Korea); - Many countries work on modernizing and expanding their fleets; and - Increasing demand for technological innovation: With the Group’s continued effort for innovation and technological leadership, the Group has successfully developed the AED (Advanced Electric Drive), an electric propulsion system for e.g., mega-yachts and other vessels with low-noise requirements and a comprehensive hybrid propulsion system offering the possibility to combine different technologies such as diesel engines, gas turbines and electric motors. The Group’s innovations ideally position it to capitalize on the trend towards the electrification of propulsion systems going forward. The Group is a global leader in the market for Navy gearboxes with a market share of approximately 30% and strong customer advocacy according to the Third Party Report. The Group’s engineering capabilities and the ability to cater to the Group’s customers’ needs has consistently helped it to manifest its leading market position, however, localization is becoming increasingly important and creates additional competitive pressure. _Stationary gearbox market_ The Group manufactures high-speed gearboxes for the energy generation and oil & gas industry, extruder gearboxes for the plastics industry and mill gearboxes for the cement industry. The market size and dynamics for high-speed gearboxes described below include this segment within the Special Gear Units and the Standard Gear Units business units as the respective end-markets overlap. The Third Party Report estimates the high-speed gearbox market for the oil & gas and energy generation industries at approximately €610 million in 2020 and expects it to grow at approximately 1 – 2% per annum to approximately €655 million in 2024. High-speed stationary gearboxes are deployed across several industries ----- such as oil & gas (up-, mid-, downstream), conventional power generation, where gearboxes are used in steam-/ gas turbines. Key highlights: - New gearbox sales in oil & gas, driven by increased capex investments, as major oil companies will relaunch projects post a potential oil price recovery; - Slight growth in the installed base and aftermarket potential, as new refinery capacity is added to market and pipeline system is growing according to the Third Party Report; - Growth in decentralized gas plants; and - In Europe, conventional power capacity is expected to decrease slightly, driven by shift to renewable energies (e.g., wind). According to the Third Party Report, the Group is among the top four suppliers in the market for high-speed gearboxes with a market share of approximately 20% (across the Special Gear Units and Standard Gear Units business unit), along with Flender, Voith, and Lufkin/Allen Gears. The Group’s addressable market is rather concentrated with the top four players accounting for approximately 70% of total revenues according to the same report. Other competitors include ZF, Naval Group, Reintjes, Abex, David Brown, Santasalo and Philadelphia Gear.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

The business unit also provides couplings for various industrial markets. _Marine gearbox market_ The Group manufactures gearboxes for civil marine applications such as medium- to large passenger ferries, LNG / LPG tankers as well as cargo and supply vessels. The Third Party Report estimates the addressable civil marine gearbox market at approximately €100€200 million in 2020 and expects it to remain largely stable with growth of approximately (1)-0% per annum until 2024 (including aftermarket). Key highlights: - Overall, civil shipbuilding is cyclical and is expected to gradually exit from its current downturn phase, yet low oil-prices and longer-term COVID-19 effects might delay market recovery; - While additions of cargo vessels are expected to decline given rather low utilization rates and uncertainty regarding the global trade outlook at this stage, additions of non-cargo vessels are set to grow at approximately 3-4% per annum until 2024 due to: - Improved commissioning of ferries partially driven by stricter safety and stability requirements; - Demand for dredgers, which is driven by the rise in global trade and need to expand waterways (e.g., Suez Canal) for larger vessels; - Stable outlook for passenger ferries for the next years. - Overall, new additions are expected to grow in Asia whereas new additions in Europe are expected to decline; - Environmental regulation continues to have a growing impact on the industry with increasing demand for more efficient and environmentally friendly solutions; and - There is some price pressure on new gearboxes driven by low cargo demand and increased competition from Asian LCCs. According to the Third Party Report, the Group is one of the three market leaders along with Flender and Wärtsilä in the civil marine gearbox market ahead of Reintjes. The market is rather concentrated with the top four Western players accounting for approximately 70% of revenues according to the same report. Traction of players in LCCs, e.g., NGC Gears from China, has been increasing in Asian markets, as shipyards increasingly source from local suppliers, partially driven by cost considerations. In the medium-term, players in LCCs are expected to continuously increase their share as shipbuilding is generally shifting to Asia. ----- Going forward, the Group expects to maintain growth on the back of recovering markets as well as an expansion into new products, e.g., the two-stroke engine market, and geographies. _Stationary gearbox market_ In the stationary end-markets, the Group manufactures stationary gearboxes and couplings for industrial applications such as turbine plants, pumps and compressors. Primary end-markets include energy generation, oil & gas, steel production, and mining. Please refer to the Special Gear Units section above for the market size and trends of high-speed gearboxes.

The Slide Bearings business unit has generated as if €83.5 million of sales revenue (before inter-business unit consolidation) for the former RENK AG Group in the twelve month period ended December 31, 2020. _E-bearings market_ E-bearings make up the majority of the Group’s sales revenue in the Slide Bearings business unit and are mainly used in industrial plants, mechanical engineering and energy generation, where they are deployed in electrical motors, generators, pumps and compressors. The Third Party Report estimates the relevant market for E-bearings at approximately €205 million in 2020 with a solid growth trajectory of approximately 2 – 3% per annum until 2024 (including aftermarket). Key highlights: - Global oil demand expected to be resilient in the long-term as hydrocarbons remain key source for growing energy needs. Following the recent turmoil in the oil & gas industry, fundamentals are showing signs of recovery as demand picks up even ahead of lockdown measures being eased; and - Large and growing installed base leads to growing aftersales market opportunities as companies tend to focus more on brownfield rather than greenfield investments. Major investments in the energy sector back in 2009 could boost the demand for maintenance and repair for years to come. According to the Third Party Report, the Group is the market leader in the relevant E-bearings market ahead of Miba. Traction of LCC manufacturers is growing, particularly in their respective home markets. The Group is defending its market share by expanding the Group’s footprint in Asia and by continuing to offer superior availability and quality, which is important given E-bearings are used in critical applications and any malfunctions result in major costs.

The new system and thus the coating process as a whole use far less energy and fewer coating and base materials than the current coating procedures. Another focus was on preventive measures to reduce energy consumption by reducing the need for air conditioning at the site. For all investments, the Group takes environmental matters into consideration. For example, as part of renovating a section of the building at the Rheine site, insulation for the walls and the roof was refurbished and upgraded to meet the latest technical standards. The heating system for this area was converted to a modern heat pump and gas heating setup, which resulted in a reduction of energy consumption by 20%. The Group also focuses on environmentally friendly, advanced and efficient technologies, which it implements through the entire life cycle of its products. Starting with the early phases of development and production, the Group seeks to ensure that it manages natural resources carefully. An example of a product including advanced and efficient technologies are high efficiency gear boxes, which utilize vacuum technology.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

Additional employees were hired in 2020 as a result of new challenges (e.g., ongoing internationalization and digitalization). Since 2019, a key focus of the Group’s hiring strategy has been the communication of the Group’s expertise and culture to new employees in order to ----- expand the Group’s expertise in various sectors. The number of employees in Germany was 2,210 as of December 31, 2020 (December 31, 2019: 2,205) and abroad was 383 as of December 31, 2020 (December 31, 2019: 364). From time to time, the Group measures employee satisfaction through surveys and it believes that the relationship with its employees is generally good. Employee turnover was 2.34% in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 and the average period of employment was approximately 15 years as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the Target Business employed 403 people (December 31, 2019: 336). The number of employees in the United States was 359 (December 31, 2019: 300) and outside the United States was 44 (December 31, 2019: 36). _Pension Liabilities_ The Group grants its employees retirement benefits in accordance with the country-specific circumstances in the form of defined benefit or defined contribution pension plans. In defined contribution plans, contributions are paid to state or private pension funds on the basis of legal or contractual regulations. There are no further payment obligations other than the payment of contributions. For example, under the pension plan scheme in Germany, the Group’s active domestic employees receive employer contributions linked to their remuneration and, in addition, also have the option of personal provision through deferred compensation (paid for by the employer for employees subject to collective bargaining agreements). In Switzerland, the defined benefit pension claims and the actuarial reserves are managed in industry-wide company pension institutions. In France, obligatory post-employment obligations are paid. The present value of RENK Holding GmbH Group’s defined benefit obligations as of December 31, 2020 was €196.0 million compared to €181.6 million for the former RENK AG Group as of December 31, 2019. RENK Holding GmbH Group’s plan assets as of December 31, 2020 were €179.9 million compared to €167.3 million for the former RENK AG Group as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, RENK Holding GmbH Group’s provisions for pension obligations amounted to €16.0 million. For additional information, see Note 21 of RENK Holding GmbH’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the short fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. The Group’s pension plan assets are managed by third-party investment funds. While the Group prescribes the general investment strategies applied by these funds, the Group does not determine their individual investment securities or alternatives. The pension plan assets are invested in various asset classes, including equity, fixed-income securities, real estate and other investment vehicles. Prior to the Acquisition, the employees of the Target Business are part of the Seller’s Combat Propulsion Systems Pension Plan (the “CPS Pension Plan”).

In the EU and Germany, the foreign trade of commodities of strategic importance, mainly weapons, armaments and dual-use items, is subject to restrictive control regimes and permit requirements. As a principle, export control regulations applicable in Germany cover three different types of security relevant products: the export of dual-use items (Güter mit _doppeltem Verwendungszweck), the export of military equipment (Rüstungsgüter), and the export of war_ weapons (Kriegswaffen). Different licensing procedures apply to each of these products—depending on the applicable category of goods, which are specified in respective lists of goods (Güterlisten). Goods designed exclusively for civil use are in principle free of export control restrictions. In the United States, export control regulations related to defense-related items are administered and enforced by the US Department of State, whereas export control regulations related to commercial, dual-use, and certain defense-related items are administered and enforced by the US Department of Commerce.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

The EU export control regime for dual-use items is governed by Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 as last amended by Regulation (EU) 2020/2171 (“Dual-Use Regulation”), which provides for common EU control rules, a common EU dual-use items list and harmonized policies for implementation. Under the EU regime, the export of dual-use items is subject to control and dual-use items may not leave the EU customs territory without an export authorisation. The Dual-Use Regulation is binding and directly applicable throughout the EU. EU Member States nevertheless need to take certain measures for implementing of some of its provisions, _e.g., in relation to breaches and applicable penalties._ On May 10, 2021, the Council of the European Union adopted a new regulation on dual-use items. After the European Parliament and the Council signed the adopted regulation, it was published in the EU Official Journal and will enter into force 90 days later at which point Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 will be repealed. The objective of the new regulation is to modernize the EU system for the control of exports, brokering, technical assistance, transit and transfer of dual-use items. The new regulation will apply to a wider range of emerging dual-use technologies and it will introduce due diligence obligations for producers. Furthermore, the new regulation is intended to strengthen coordination between the EU and partner countries through more convergent approaches to export controls at global level. In Germany, besides the Dual-Use Regulation, export control of dual-use items is governed by the Foreign Trade and Payments Act (Außenwirtschaftsgesetz, “AWG”) and the Foreign Trade and Payments Ordinance (Außenwirtschaftsverordnung, “AWV”), among other provisions. Export authorizations are generally granted by the Federal Office of Economics and Export Control (Bundesamt für Wirtschaft und Ausfuhrkontrolle, “BAFA”).",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

The military equipment is listed in full in Part I Section A of the so-called Export List (Ausfuhrliste) which is the first annex to the AWV. It is divided down into 22 positions (No. 0001 to No. 0022) that have their own sub-divisions. In accordance with the principle of the freedom of external economic transactions, on which the systematic approach of the AWG is based, the applicant has a fundamental right to the issuance of an export license, unless a license may be denied because of a violation of interests protected under the AWG. The application of export regulations by the BAFA is subject to a broad and rather political discretion, which was redefined by the Federal Government in 2019 within the framework of the so-called Political Principles of the Federal Government for the Export of War Weapons and Other Military Equipment (Politische Grundsätze der Bundesregierung für _den Export von Kriegswaffen und sonstigen Rüstungsgütern)._ Some of the military equipment articles falling under the Export List are also war weapons as defined by Art. 26(2) of the Basic Law (Grundgesetz) and by the War Weapons Control Act (Kriegswaffenkontrollgesetz, _“KrWaffKontrG”). Pursuant to the KrWaffKontrG, war weapons are items, substances or organisms that are_ capable alone or in conjunction with each other or with other items, substances or organisms of causing disruption or damage to persons or things and of being used as a means of violence in armed conflicts ----- between states. They are listed in the 62 positions of the War Weapons List (Kriegsgwaffenliste) which is the annex to the KrWaffKontrG. For the export of these weapons, a license must be obtained under the KrWaffKontrG (transport authorisation for the purpose of export), and additionally an export license pursuant to the AWG and AWV. In the case of the movement of goods between EU member states, the movement (Verbringung) from Germany may be subject to licensing under both European and national foreign trade law. Furthermore, under European law, movements which require a license are subject to a documentation requirement, while shipments which do not require a license are subject to an information requirement. A license is required, _inter alia, if (i) the goods are listed in Annex IV of the Dual-Use Regulation, (ii) the goods are listed in Part I_ Section A of the Export List, (iii) the goods are listed in Part I Section B of the Export List (which contains a list of additionally national covered dual-use items) and the final destination is outside the EU. Furthermore, a license may be required if the goods are or may be intended, in their entirety or in part, for the construction or operation of a plant or for incorporation into a plant for nuclear purposes. Restrictions on the export of goods may also exist due to embargoes. Embargoes can be imposed for foreign or security policy reasons and restrict freedom of foreign trade with respect to certain countries.

DDTC administers the ITAR pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act (“AECA”), a statute that authorizes the President of the United States to control the temporary import and the export of defense articles and the provision of defense services. Accordingly, the ITAR define what it means for something to be a “defense article” or a “defense service,” define what is “technical data,” and regulate the export and re-export of covered articles, services, and technical data, including by imposing licensing requirements. An export license is required under the ITAR for the export of ITAR-controlled technical data or any defense article on the United States Munitions List (“USML,”Part 121 of the ITAR) to any destination, with certain narrow exemptions. The term “export” under the ITAR is defined broadly to include not only physical exports from the United States but also domestic transfers of technical data to non-US persons. Similarly, prior licensing from DDTC is typically required to provide ITAR-controlled “defense services.” Separately, the US Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) administers and enforces the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”), which are export control regulations promulgated pursuant to the Export Control Reform Act of 2018. The EAR restrict the export, reexport, and in-country transfer of commodities, software, and technology (collectively, “items”) controlled under the EAR, including items enumerated on the Commerce Control List (“CCL,” Part 774 of the EAR). Typically, an item is regulated under the EAR if it is located in the United States (regardless of its country of origin) or if it is of US-origin (regardless of its location). Also, an item located outside the United States may be regulated under the EAR if it incorporates more than a small amount of controlled US-origin content, or if it is the “direct product” of sensitive US-origin technology. In certain cases, parties must obtain prior licensing from BIS to export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) an EAR-regulated item.

As soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of such a notice instructing the Security Agent to solicit instructions to enforce the Transaction Security or take any other Enforcement Action given by the Majority Super Senior Creditors and/or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (as the case may be), the Security Agent shall distribute such notice to the relevant addressees promptly upon receipt, following which, each Senior Agent (acting on the instructions of the Majority Super Senior Creditors), the Trustee and the creditor representative(s) of the Future Pari Passu Creditors will consult in good faith with each other and the Security Agent for a period of not less than 30 days from the date such notice is received by such persons (or such ----- shorter period as the relevant parties may agree) (the “Consultation Period”) with a view to coordinating the instructions to be given by an Instructing Group and agreeing an enforcement strategy. Generally, no such consultation shall be required (and an Instructing Group shall be entitled to give any instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security or take any other Enforcement Action prior to the end of the Consultation Period, in each case provided such instructions comply with the Security Enforcement Principles (“Qualifying Instructions”)) where: (a) the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an insolvency event affecting FinCo, the Issuer, any Obligor (owing liabilities to any Primary Creditor or the Issuer) or any Third Party Security Provider or “significant subsidiary” (as applicable) (each a “Relevant Company”); or (b) subject to no instructions being given by an Instructing Group at any time (whether before or after the end of the Consultation Period) an insolvency event has occurred which is continuing with respect to a Third Party Security Provider or Relevant Company and the Security Agent has not commenced any Enforcement (or any transaction in lieu) or other Enforcement Action at that time with respect to such Third Party Security Provider or Relevant Company, if the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors determine in good faith (and notify the creditor representatives of each of the other Super Senior Lenders, Cash Management Providers (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), Additional Credit Facility Lenders, Priority Hedge Counterparties, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, the Future Pari Passu Creditors and the Security Agent) that to enter into such consultations and thereby delay the commencement of enforcement of the Transaction Security could reasonably be expected to reduce the amount likely to be realized to a level such that (following application thereof in accordance with the “Payments Waterfall” (as defined below) described below under the caption “—Application of Proceeds/Waterfall”) the Super Senior Liabilities would not be discharged in full and in this case any instructions will be limited to those necessary to protect or preserve the interests of the Senior Secured Creditors on behalf of which the relevant Instructing Group is acting and the Security Agent shall act in accordance with the instructions first received. If, following the Consultation Period, the Majority Super Senior Creditors and/or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have agreed on an enforcement strategy, the Security Agent shall be instructed to implement the same. Subject to the paragraph below, in the event that conflicting instructions (and for these purposes silence is deemed to be a conflicting instruction) are received from either Instructing Group by the end of (or following) the Consultation Period, the Security Agent shall enforce the Transaction Security and/or refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security and/or take the relevant other Enforcement Action in accordance with the instructions provided by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, provided that any such instructions are Qualifying Instructions and the terms of all instructions received by the Majority Super Senior Creditors during the Consultation Period shall be deemed revoked. If, prior to the Super Senior Discharge Date, either (x) the Super Senior Discharge Date has not occurred within six months of the end of the Consultation Period, (y) the Security Agent has not commenced any Enforcement (or any transaction in lieu) or other Enforcement Action within three months of the end of the Consultation Period or (z) at any time (whether before or after the end of the Consultation Period) an insolvency event has occurred with respect to a Third Party Security Provider or Relevant Company and the Security Agent has not commenced any Enforcement (or any transaction in lieu) or other Enforcement Action at that time with respect to such Third Party Security Provider or Relevant Company, then, in relation to instructions with respect to any Enforcement, the Security Agent shall thereafter follow any instructions that are subsequently given by the Majority Super Senior Creditors (in each case provided the same are Qualifying Instructions) to the exclusion of those given by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (to the extent conflicting with any instructions previously given by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors). _Security Enforcement Principles_ The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that enforcement of the Transaction Security must be conducted in accordance with the “Security Enforcement Principles,” which principles shall include the following: (a) It shall be the aim of any Enforcement of the Transaction Security to maximize, so far as is consistent with a prompt and expeditious realization of value from Enforcement of the Transaction Security, and in a manner consistent with the Intercreditor Agreement, the recovery by the Super Senior Creditors, the Senior Secured Creditors and their representatives, and the Future Senior Subordinated Creditors (to ----- the extent the Transaction Security is expressed to secure such debt) and their representatives (the “Security Enforcement Objective”). (b) Without prejudice to the Security Enforcement Objective and unless otherwise agreed by the Majority Super Senior Creditors, the Transaction Security will be enforced and any other action as to Enforcement will be taken such that either: (i) all proceeds of Enforcement are received by the Security Agent in cash (or substantially all cash) for distribution in accordance with the Payments Waterfall; or (ii) sufficient proceeds of Enforcement will be received by the Security Agent in cash to ensure that when the proceeds are applied in accordance with the Payments Waterfall, the Super Senior Liabilities are repaid and discharged in full. (c) The Enforcement Action must be prompt and expeditious and should be reasonably expected to realise value from the Enforcement of the Transaction Security or Distressed Disposal pursuant to Enforcement by no later than the day falling six (6) months after the last day of the Consultation Period. (d) On: (i) a proposed Enforcement of any of the Transaction Security over assets other than shares in a member of the Restricted Group, where the aggregate book value of such assets exceeds €5.0 million (or its equivalent); or (ii) a proposed Enforcement of any of the Transaction Security over some or all of the shares in a member of the Restricted Group over which Transaction Security exists, the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the Instructing Group) shall (unless such enforcement is made pursuant to a public auction or process supervised by a court of law which makes a determination as to value) obtain an opinion from a reputable internationally recognized investment bank or international accounting firm or other reputable, third-party professional firm that is regularly engaged in providing valuations of businesses or assets similar or comparable to those charged under the Transaction Security to be enforced (a “Financial Advisor”) to opine as expert: (A) on the optimal method of enforcing the Transaction Security so as to achieve the Security Enforcement Objective and maximize the recovery of any such Enforcement Action; (B) that the proceeds received from Enforcement are fair from a financial point of view after taking into account all relevant circumstances; and (C) that such sale is otherwise in accordance with the Security Enforcement Objective. (e) The Security Agent shall be under no obligation to appoint a Financial Advisor or to seek the advice of a Financial Advisor, unless expressly required to do so by the Intercreditor Agreement. It is understood that the Financial Advisor may limit its liability in respect of the opinion referred to in (c) above to the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement. The Financial Advisor’s Opinion (or any equivalent opinion obtained by the Security Agent in relation to any other Enforcement of the Transaction Security that such action is fair from a financial point of view after taking into account all relevant circumstances) will be conclusive evidence that the Security Enforcement Objective has been met. Unless otherwise agreed by the Majority Super Senior Creditors, following the expiry of the six (6) month period referred to above, the Security Enforcement Objective shall cease to apply to any enforcement of the Transaction Security until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred. In the event that an Enforcement of the Transaction Security is over assets and shares referred to above and such Enforcement is conducted by way of public auction, any equity investors of the Restricted Group shall be entitled to participate in such auction. Nothing in the Security Enforcement Principles requires Enforcement of Transaction Security to take place by way of public auction. In the absence of written notice from a Creditor or group of Creditors that are not part of the relevant Instructing Group that such Creditor(s) object(s) to any Enforcement of the Transaction Security on the grounds that such Enforcement Action does not aim to achieve the Security Enforcement Objective (an “Objection”), the Security Agent is entitled to assume that such Enforcement of the Transaction Security is in accordance with the Security Enforcement Objective. ----- If the Security Agent receives an Objection (and without prejudice to the ability of the Security Agent to rely on other advisers and/or exercise its own judgement in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement), a Financial Advisor’s Opinion to the effect that the particular action could reasonably be said to be aimed at achieving the Security Enforcement Objective will be conclusive evidence that the Security Enforcement Objective has been met.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Super Senior Facilities and the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, capital maintenance and liquidity protection provisions, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and similar principles. Each Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance, capital maintenance, liquidity protection and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee.

Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under the section “Transfer Restrictions”in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective participants. Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests”) denominated in the same currency only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

See “Risk Factors— _Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral.”_ Any other security interests that may in the future be granted to secure obligations under the Notes, any Guarantee and the Indenture would also constitute “Collateral.”All Collateral will be subject to the operation of the Agreed Security Principles and any Permitted Collateral Liens. Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of the covenant described below under “— Certain _Covenants—Future Guarantees,” certain property, rights and assets may not be pledged, and any pledge over_ property, rights and assets may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles. Pursuant to the Agreed Security Principles, a guarantee or security may not be given, or may be limited. The following is a non-exhaustive summary of certain terms of the Agreed Security Principles which include, among others: - general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance, equity subordination, fraudulent conveyance and/or preference, “interest stripping,” “controlled foreign corporation,” transfer pricing or “thin capitalization” rules, tax restrictions, retention of title claims and similar principles may prohibit, limit or otherwise restrict the ability of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a guarantee or security or may require that the guarantee or security be limited by an amount or otherwise. If any such limit applies, the guarantees and security provided (or the enforceability thereof) will be limited to the maximum amount which the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary may provide, having regard to applicable law (including any jurisprudence or case law) and subject to fiduciary duties of management. A guarantee or security interest will not be required if, or its enforceability will be limited if and to the extent that, giving such guarantee or taking such security would expose the directors, officers or employees of the relevant company to a risk of personal liability. The Issuer will use reasonable endeavors to assist in demonstrating that adequate corporate benefit accrues to each Guarantor; - certain supervisory board, advisory board, works council, regulator or regulatory board (or equivalent), or another external body’s or person’s consent may be required to enable the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary to provide a guarantee or security. Such guarantee and/or security shall not be required unless requested by the agent for the lenders under the Super Senior Facilities Agreement prior to signing any applicable Security Document or supplemental indenture and such consent has been received provided that reasonable endeavors have been used by the Issuer or relevant Restricted Subsidiary (without incurring material cost) to obtain the relevant consent to the extent permissible by law and regulation and such consent has no material adverse impact on relationships with third parties; - a key factor in determining whether or not a guarantee or security shall be taken (and the extent of the perfection and/or registration of such security) is the applicable time and cost to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (including adverse effects in relation to taxes, interest deductibility and stamp duty, notarization, translation costs and registration fees), which shall not be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Lenders of obtaining such guarantee, security or perfection;

- the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not be required to give guarantees or enter into Security Documents if (A) it is not within their legal capacity to do so or (B) it would conflict with the fiduciary duties of their directors, officers or employees, contravene any legal or regulatory prohibition, bona fide contractual restriction or regulatory condition or result in a risk of personal or criminal liability on the part of any director, officer or employee provided that the Issuer or relevant Restricted Subsidiary shall use reasonable endeavors to overcome any such obstacle without incurring material cost; - the giving of a guarantee, the granting of security or the perfection of security granted will not be required if it would be unduly burdensome or restrict the ability of the Issuer or relevant Guarantor to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course or as otherwise permitted by the Super Senior Facilities Agreement and the “finance documents” thereunder (including, without limitation, notification of receivables security to third party debtors or a charge over bank accounts until an enforcement event has occurred and is continuing), and any requirement under these Agreed Security Principles to seek the consent of any person or to take or not take any other action shall be subject to this paragraph; - unless granted under a global security document governed by the law of the jurisdiction of the Issuer or a Guarantor or under English law, all security (other than share security over its guarantor company subsidiaries, where applicable) shall be governed by the law of and secure assets located in the jurisdiction of incorporation or formation of the Issuer or that Guarantor, provided that any security granted over the shares and assets of a Guarantor organized within the United States may be governed by the law of the State of new York; - no title investigations or other diligence on assets will be required and no title insurance will be required; - security or guarantees shall only be required to be given by or in respect of an entity or any assets incorporated or located, as the case may be, in the United States of America, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France, Switzerland, Luxembourg and any other jurisdiction in which a borrower under the Super Senior Facilities Agreement is incorporated (or over the shares of any entity incorporated in such jurisdiction); - no guarantee or security will be required from or over, or over the assets of, any joint venture or similar arrangement or any minority interest; - no perfection action will be required in jurisdictions where the Issuer and the Guarantors are not incorporated or formed; - where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of granting security over the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such security, security will be granted over the material assets only; - in no event shall control agreements or perfection by control or similar arrangements be required with respect to any assets (including, but not limited to, deposit or securities accounts and uncertificated shares); - other than a general security agreement and related filing, no perfection, filing or other action will be required with respect to assets of a type not owned by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries; - no security will be granted over escrow accounts in connection with an acquisition, a disposal or an offering of debt securities and share capital increase accounts; - other than over certain material structural receivables, no security will be granted over intercompany receivables or receivables that are made as part of the cash pooling system of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries or the Target Group; ----- - no security will be granted over parts, stock, moveable plant, equipment or receivables if it would require labelling, segregation or periodic listing or specification of such parts, stock, moveable plants, equipment or receivable; - perfection will not be required in respect of (A) vehicles and other assets subject to certificates of title or (B) letter of credit rights and tort claims (or the local law equivalent); - no security will be required over any assets subject to security in favor of a third party or any cash constituting regulatory capital or customer cash (and such assets or cash shall be excluded from any relevant Security Document); and - obligations in respect of the Notes Documents will not be guaranteed by any CFC, any FSHCO or any direct or indirect Subsidiary of a CFC. In addition, no security will be granted over any (i) any assets of any CFC, of any FSHCO or of any direct or indirect Subsidiary of a CFC or (ii) equity interests of a CFC or of a FSHCO, other than 65% of the total outstanding voting equity interests and 100% of the total outstanding non-voting equity interests of such CFC or FSHCO.

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption”or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will mail a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder of Notes, with a copy to the Trustee: (1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”); (2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed) and the record date (the “Change of Control Payment Date”); (3) stating that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Payment is not paid, and that any Notes or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest; (4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control; (5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and (6) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control. On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes so tendered; (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer; (4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent the Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and (5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer. If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) will, at the cost of the Issuer, promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any, provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount that is at least €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. ----- If and so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited and to the extent that the rules and regulations of The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any Change of Control Offer. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. The closing date of any such Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control may be changed to conform to the actual closing date of the Change of Control, provided that such closing date is not earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date the Change of Control Offer notice is mailed as described in the second paragraph of this section. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of the conflict. If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third-party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding the date of redemption. The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control may require a mandatory prepayment of certain Indebtedness. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under certain Indebtedness and may require a mandatory prepayment of such Indebtedness may not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the _Guarantees and the Collateral—We may not be able to repay the Notes, when due or to repurchase the Notes when we are required to do so pursuant to certain events constituting a Change of Control or otherwise, and the Change of Control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events.”_ The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,”there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all”of the property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. ----- The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant: (1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and third paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the third paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant; (2) all Indebtedness outstanding on the Acquisition Closing Date under the Super Senior Facilities shall be deemed initially Incurred under clause(1) of the third paragraph of this covenant and not the first paragraph or clause (4)(b) of the third paragraph of this covenant, and may not be reclassified; (3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included; (4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (7), (11) or (15) of the third paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included; (5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof; (6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness; (7) for the purposes of determining “Consolidated EBITDA” (x) pro forma effect shall be given to Consolidated EBITDA on the same basis for calculating the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries and (y) in relation to clause (1) of the third paragraph of this covenant, Consolidated EBITDA shall be measured on the most recent date on which new commitments are obtained (in the case of revolving facilities) or the date on which new Indebtedness is Incurred (in the ----- case of term facilities) and for the period of the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters ending prior to such date for which such internal consolidated financial statements of the Issuer are available; and (8) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS. Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “— Limitation on Indebtedness.” Except as otherwise specified, the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (b) the principal amount, or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness. For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness Incurred under a Credit Facility, reborrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to “cash sweep” provisions or any similar provisions under a Credit Facility that provide that Indebtedness is deemed to be repaid daily (or otherwise periodically), including any revolving indebtedness, shall only be deemed for purposes of this covenant to have been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on the date of any subsequent reborrowing thereof. If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under “— _Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant)._ For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or, at the option of the Issuer, first committed, in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that; (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro- denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded, so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the definition of Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Acquisition Closing Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to the euro) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in euro will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor will incur any Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt) that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor unless such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and the applicable Guarantee, if any, on substantially identical terms; provided, however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured with different collateral or by virtue of being secured on a junior priority basis or by virtue of the application of waterfall or other payment ordering provisions affecting different tranches of Indebtedness. No Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured on a first or junior Lien basis.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

The Indenture provides that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture. The Indenture provides for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured (including by way of pre-funding) to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

The Indenture has not been qualified under and does not incorporate or include, by reference or otherwise, nor is it subject to, any of the provisions of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. The proceeds of the offering of the 2021 Additional Notes to be issued on, 2021 (the “Additional Notes Issue Date”) will be used by the Issuer as set forth under the section titled “Use of Proceeds” in this Offering Memorandum. The Indenture is unlimited in aggregate principal amount, pursuant to which the Issuer has previously issued €320.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (the “Original Notes” and together with the 2021 Additional Notes, and any other Additional Notes (as defined below) subsequently issued under the Indenture, the “Notes”, unless the context otherwise requires). The 2021 Additional Notes will have the same terms and conditions as the Original Notes and will constitute a single class of securities with the Original Notes and any Additional Notes for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation. waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase, except as otherwise provided for in the Indenture or set forth herein. The 2021 Additional Notes will be issued as “Additional Notes” under the Indenture.

In particular, (a) the 2021 Additional Notes sold pursuant to Rule 144A will have a different temporary ISIN number and common code from, and will not trade fungibly with, the Original Notes sold pursuant to Rule 144A during the period prior to and including the first interest payment date after the Additional Notes Issue Date, and (b) the 2021 Additional Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S will have a temporary ISIN number and common code, and will not trade fungibly with, the Original Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S during the period prior to and including the 40th day following the Additional Notes Issue Date.

364,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,169,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND SECURITY INTERESTS,169.1,European Union,169.1.1,Main Insolvency Proceedings,"Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court which shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the member state of the European Union (the “Member State”) (other than Denmark) within which the center of a debtor’s main interests is situated. The “center of main interests”is defined as “the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties.” Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the center of main interests of a company or legal person is presumed to be located in the Member State of the registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. That presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within a three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Specifically, it should be possible to rebut this presumption where the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. In this regard, special consideration should be given to creditors and their perception as to where a debtor conducts the administration of its interests. In the event of a shift in the center of main interests, this may require informing the creditors of the new location from which the debtor is carrying out its activities in due course (e.g., by drawing attention to the change of address in commercial correspondence or otherwise making the new location public through other appropriate means). If the “center of main interests” of a company at the time an insolvency application is made, is located in a Member State (other than Denmark), the main insolvency proceedings with respect to the company under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and, accordingly, a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member State within the territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with Article 3 shall have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with them, such as avoidance actions.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511
364,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,169,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND SECURITY INTERESTS,169.1,European Union,169.1.2,Secondary Insolvency Proceedings,"Insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be opened in other Member States. If the “center of main interests” of a debtor is in one Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open “secondary”or “territorial”insolvency proceedings only in the event that such debtor has an “establishment” in the territory of such other Member State. Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation and for the avoidance of doubt, are not limited to winding up proceedings. Territorial proceedings are, in effect, secondary proceedings which are commenced prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings and which will usually convert to ----- secondary proceedings on the opening of the main proceedings. “Establishment” is defined as any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. The effects of those territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State. Pursuant to Article 3(4) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where main proceedings in the Member State in which the company has its center of main interests have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can only be opened in another Member State where the company has an establishment and either: (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the Member State in which the company’s center of main interests is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of a creditor whose claim arises from or in connection with the operation of such establishment or a public authority, which has the right to request such opening under the respective Member State’s law, requests the opening of such proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exemptions, be governed by the _lex fori concursus; that is, the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction for the respective_ main, territorial or secondary insolvency proceedings, as the case may be, of the company. Pursuant to Article 21 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency officeholder appointed by the court of the main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of the company from that other Member State), subject to certain limitations, so long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other Member State or any preservation measure has been taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the company has assets. However, under Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings may prevent the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State by giving a unilateral undertaking with respect to the assets located in the Member State in which secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened. For this purpose, the insolvency practitioner must undertake to comply with the distribution and priority rights under the relevant national law from which the local creditors would benefit if the insolvency proceedings were opened in the Member State where the assets are located. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a qualified majority of known local creditors, determined in accordance with applicable local laws. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it should, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceeding if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors. Additionally, under Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and its creditors, the court, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, may stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding three months, provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local creditors. Under Article 46 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court which opened the secondary insolvency proceedings will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part on receipt of a request from the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a renewable period of up to three months, unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods. In the case where the court stays the process of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the secondary insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors. Pursuant to Article 4 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, a court requested to open insolvency proceedings will be required to examine whether it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 3; such decision may be challenged by the debtor or any creditor on grounds of international jurisdiction.

An essential part of the law is the introduction of a new Act on a Stabilisation and Restructuring Framework for Enterprises (“Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act”), which establishes a comprehensive legal framework for out-of-court restructurings in Germany. Proceedings under the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act (“Restructuring Proceedings”) are initiated through a notification by the respective debtor to affected creditors (with regard to chapter 1 of the StaRUG) and/or the competent restructuring court (Anzeige des Restrukturierungsvorhabens). Restructuring Proceedings are applicable in cases in which a debtor ----- faces imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit), i.e. that there is the imminent risk for the debtor of being unable to pay any of its debt as and when it falls due during the course of (regularly) the next 24 months. A debtor can access the new restructuring tools of the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act upon the occurrence of imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) which is triggered when it is likely that the debtor will not be able to meet its future payment obligations that fall due over the next 24 months. The debtor’s management is not obliged to make use of the tools of the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act. Therefore, the debtor may alternatively file for regular insolvency proceedings if the respective requirements are met (see above under “—Insolvency.”). Unlike insolvency proceedings, the tools under the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act do not necessarily cover all of a debtor’s liabilities, as the debtor has a certain amount of flexibility under the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act to adapt the scope of the available tools to cover either all of the debtor’s liabilities, only certain types (e.g., financial liabilities, including under the Notes), or only selected liabilities. In addition and depending on the extent to which a debtor requires to make use of certain legal tools available under the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act, the involvement of the competent restructuring court can be kept to a minimum and the tools can—under certain circumstances—even be used without the need for any public notices despite being binding on affected creditors. The tools available under the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act may in the case of a group of companies only be used for each entity separately (an important exception is the ability to extend the effect of certain tools to cover security granted by entities that are connected entities (verbundene Unternehmen) of the debtor). However, the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act provides for a respective application of the provisions of the German Insolvency Code which implemented the law to facilitate the mastering of group insolvencies (see above under “—Insolvency.”). The core component of the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act is an out-of-court restructuring of a debtor’s liabilities via a restructuring plan, including, e.g., by way of changes to the principal amounts, interest rates and/or maturities of liabilities. Such restructuring plan may also negatively impact (including, e.g., a release of) collateral granted for the benefit of the Notes by the debtor as well as its subsidiaries, parent and sister companies. A restructuring plan can generally be adopted and become binding for creditors upon being approved by the required majority or majorities of a debtors’ creditors. The restructuring plan will be voted on in classes. The adoption of the restructuring plan requires, in principle, that in each class a majority of three-quarters of the voting rights approve the plan (whereas voting rights are determined by the amount of the claim, the value of the security and, in the case of share or membership rights, the share of the subscribed capital of the debtor). However, if more than one class is formed, the restructuring plan can even be adopted and become binding on creditors if creditor class(es) have not approved the plan, provided certain requirements are met and the restructuring court confirms the restructuring plan (cross-class cramdown). The Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act provides for additional tools that may be used by the debtor so as to facilitate the preparation, negotiations and implementation of a restructuring plan. These tools include a stabilization order by the restructuring court (which is granted upon the application by the debtor and if certain requirements are met). Such stabilization order can restrict enforcement measures by certain or all creditors. The stabilization order can initially be granted for a maximum period of up to three months, with subsequent orders to extend the stabilization order up to a maximum of eight months subject to certain conditions being satisfied. For the holders of the Notes, among the relevant consequences of the use of any tools available under the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act by a Guarantor would be the following: - The negotiation and drafting of a restructuring plan by the debtor is potentially subject to no or only limited review and/or supervision by a court; - restrictions on individual enforcement or foreclosure actions for all or certain creditors for a period of up to eight months due to a stabilization order; - any claims and rights of the holder of the Notes can be subject to and potentially be compromised by the restructuring plan (e.g. in relation to claims in the form of a reduction in principal and/or interest or a deferral and in relation to security rights in the form of a release and an adjustment of the ranking of the security right); - any collateral granted by the debtor as well as intra-group collateral may be subject to Restructuring Proceedings potentially leading to a negative impact on the respective collateral; and ----- - a restructuring plan can be adopted and the measures therein can become binding on any holder of the Notes without the consent of each holder of the Notes and, if the prerequisites for a cross-class cram-down are fulfilled, even without the consent of any of the holders of the Notes. Restructuring plans which are public and confirmed by a German restructuring court will be recognized in any EU member state pursuant to the EU Insolvency Proceedings Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings) upon such proceeding being included as a recognized proceeding in Exhibit A of that Regulation. In any other case, the recognition of the restructuring plan is subject to certain rules and regulations under applicable international private law.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

KG”). As a general rule, sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (“Sections 30 and 31”) prohibit a GmbH from disbursing its assets to its shareholders to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s net assets (i.e., assets less liabilities and liability reserves)—or, in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, its general partner’s net assets—is or would fall below the amount of its stated share capital (Stammkapital). Guarantees or security interests granted by a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG in order to guarantee liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company are considered disbursements under sections 30 and 31 GmbHG. Moreover, under section 64 sentence 3 GmbHG a managing director (Geschäftsführer) of a GmbH can be held personally liable in certain circumstances for payments to shareholders that would render the GmbH illiquid. The granting of guarantees and security interests for the benefit of direct or indirect parent or sister companies of the GmbH could be considered as such disbursements and payments to shareholders. In relation to a GmbH& Co. KG the capital maintenance and liquidity maintenance rules and principles described above for GmbHs apply, mutatis mutandis, also to the general partners of the GmbH & Co. KGs. German capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance and financial assistance rules (including with respect to Sections 30, 31 and 64 sentence 3 GmbH and Sections 57, 71a and 92 para. 2 sentence 3 AktG), are subject to evolving case law (see, for example, the more recent decision of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) dated March 21,2017, file no. II ZR 93/16, regarding the preservation of the share capital). The Issuer cannot assure you that future court rulings may not further limit the access of shareholders to assets of German Guarantors constituted in the form of, as applicable, a German stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft), a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG, which can negatively affect the ability of the German ----- Guarantor to make payment on the Notes or of the German Guarantors to make payments on the Notes or the related guarantees or the enforceability of the Guarantees, the Indenture and the Security Documents relating to the Collateral provided by the German Guarantors. In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) regarding so-called “destructive interference” (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation where a shareholder deprives its company of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a guarantee granted or security interests granted by the Parent, the Issuer and a German Guarantor. In such case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced, even to zero. Moreover, according to a decision of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a security or guarantee agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows about the distressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant collateral by disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting of guarantees and/or security interests to be granted by the Issuer and the German Guarantors (including in the legal form of a German stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft). Furthermore, the beneficiary (e.g., a holder of the Notes) of a transaction qualifying as a repayment of the stated share capital of the grantor of the guarantee or the security interests, as applicable, (e.g., the enforcement of such guarantee or security interest) could become personally liable under exceptional circumstances. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the grantor of the guarantee or the security interests was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511
364,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,169,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND SECURITY INTERESTS,169.2,Germany,169.2.4,Security Interests/Parallel Debt,"Under German law, certain security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) are of strict accessory nature and are therefore dependent on the secured claims and require the security holder and the creditor of the secured claim to be identical. Such accessory security interests (akzessorische Sicherungsrechte) (i) will automatically lapse to the extent a secured claim is settled, discharged or novated, (ii) may not be assigned independently, but would automatically follow the claims they secure in case the relevant secured claim is assigned and (iii) may only be granted to the creditor of a claim to be secured by the accessory security interest. The accessory security interests will also be granted to the Security Agent. The Security Agent is however not a creditor under the Notes. The holders on the other hand are creditors under the Notes. In order to allow the holders to benefit from the pledges, such pledges will also secure a so-called “parallel debt” obligation created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent rather than secure the holders’ claims under the Notes directly. The parallel debt is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and the Guarantees (the “Principal Obligations”), and any payment with respect to the Principal Obligations will discharge the corresponding parallel debt and any payment with respect to the parallel debt will discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the Security Agent will have, pursuant to the parallel debt, a claim against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the full principal amount of the Notes, the legal concept of creating parallel debt obligations has not yet been tested before a German court. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that such concept will not be recognized by German courts or that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of invalidity and unenforceability of pledges. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the collateral may be restricted. In addition, holders of the Notes bear some risk associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. This means that in the case of an insolvency of the Security Agent, the insolvency administrator over the insolvency estate of the Security Agent may successfully claim that there is no separation right (Aussonderungsrecht) of the holders with respect to the secured claims. As a consequence the secured claims (including the parallel debt) and the accessory security rights would remain with the (then insolvent) Security Agent. German law does not generally permit the appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon enforcement of the pledge. The enforcement of a share pledge under German law usually requires the sale of the asset constituting the collateral through a formal process involving a public auction to which certain waiting periods and notice requirements apply. Under German law, it is unclear whether the security interest in the collateral gives the Security Agent the right to prevent other creditors of the entities having granted such security from ----- foreclosing on and realizing the asset constituting the collateral. Some courts have held that certain types of security interests only give their holders priority (according to their ranking) in the distribution of any proceeds from the realization of the asset constituting the collateral and no right to intervene (i.e., the right to request the court to impose a stay on proceedings initiated by other creditors).",N/A,as_expected,2021,511
364,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,169,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND SECURITY INTERESTS,169.2,Germany,169.2.5,,"The Issuer is organized under the laws of Germany, have their registered offices in Germany and, except for shareholding interests in certain subsidiaries, substantially all of their assets are located in Germany. In the event of an insolvency of the Issuer and these certain Guarantors under the laws of Germany at the time the application for the opening of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) is filed, German insolvency law would most likely be initiated in Germany. Such proceedings would then be governed by German law. Under certain circumstances, insolvency proceedings may also be opened in Germany in accordance with German law over the assets of companies that are not established under German law (for example, if the center of main interests of such company is within Germany) or, vice versa, insolvency over the Issuer or such German Guarantors may be opened in other jurisdictions. The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) may not be as favorable to your interest as creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions with which you may be familiar, including, inter alia, with respect to priority of creditors’ claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest as well as in certain circumstances priority recovery for secured creditors and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and hence may limit the ability of creditors to recover payments due on the Notes and the Guarantees to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany: Under German insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept, which generally means that, despite the economic ties between various entities within one group of companies, there will be one separate insolvency proceeding for each of the entities if and to the extent there exists an insolvency reason on the part of the relevant entity. Each of these insolvency proceedings will be legally independent from all other insolvency proceedings (if any) within the group. In particular, there is no consolidation of assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency and no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group. Recently, the German legislator adopted an act to facilitate the handling of group insolvencies (Gesetz _zur Erleichterung der Bewältigung von Konzerninsolvenzen) which entered into force on April 21, 2018._ However, this act mainly provides for coordination of and cooperation between insolvency proceedings of group companies. The act does not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies or pooling of claims amongst the respective entities of a group, but rather stipulates four key amendments of the German Insolvency Code in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court may be competent for each group entity insolvency proceeding; (ii) the appointment of a single person as insolvency administrator for all group companies is facilitated; (iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for “coordination proceedings” (Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a “coordination insolvency administrator” (Koordinationsverwalter) with the ability to propose a “coordination plan” (Koordinationsplan). Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court ex _officio, but require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings._ Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of over-indebtedness ----- (Überschuldung) of the debtor or in the event that the debtor is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due (Zahlungsunfähigkeit). According to the relevant provision of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), a debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation values), unless a continuation of the debtor’s business is predominantly likely (überwiegend _wahrscheinlich) at least for the current and the subsequent fiscal year (positive Fortführungsprognose). As a_ guideline, the debtor is deemed illiquid if it is unable to pay 10% or more of its due and payable liabilities during the subsequent three weeks, unless it is virtually certain that the company can close the liquidity gap shortly thereafter (demnächst) and it can be deemed acceptable to the creditor to continue to wait for the payments owed by such debtor. If a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft—AG), a European law stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea—SE) or a company with limited liability (Gesellschaft mit _beschränkter Haftung—GmbH) or any company not having an individual as personally liable shareholder or_ partner—such as the Issuer and the German Guarantors—the management of such company and, under certain circumstances, its shareholders, are obliged to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay, however, at the latest within three (3) weeks after the mandatory insolvency reason, i.e., illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness, occurred. Non-compliance with these obligations exposes the management to both severe damage claims as well as sanctions under criminal law. Once illiquidity or over-indebtedness occurred, any payments, including any payments under the Notes or the Guarantees, may be voidable. A debtor is not considered over indebted even when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets if, given the circumstances, it is more likely than not that the debtor’s business can survive as a going concern. In addition, only the debtor, but not the creditors, can file for the opening of insolvency proceedings in the event of imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit), i.e., if there is the imminent risk of the company being unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due at some point in time within a certain prognosis period, whereas imminent illiquidity does not give rise to an obligation for the management of the debtor to file for insolvency proceedings. If a company faces imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and/or is over indebted (Überschuldung) it may also file for preliminary debtor in possession moratorium proceedings (Schutzschirmverfahren) unless—from a third-party perspective—there is no reasonable chance for a successful restructuring. Upon such filing by the debtor, the court will appoint a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger _Sachwalter) and prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to immoveable assets). It may also_ implement other preliminary measures to protect the debtor from creditor enforcement actions for up to three months. During that period, the debtor shall prepare an insolvency plan which ideally shall be implemented in formal debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) after formal insolvency proceedings have been opened. The insolvency proceedings are controlled by the competent insolvency court, which monitors the due performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take preliminary measures to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings insofar as these protective measures are reasonable to protect the debtor’s assets and/or to ensure the continuation of the debtor’s business. The Act to Temporarily Suspend the Obligation to File for Insolvency and to Limit Directors’ Liability in the Case of Insolvency Caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic, which was adopted on March 27, 2020 (as amended from time to time, the “COVInsAG”), provides, inter alia, for a suspension of the obligation to file for insolvency until, currently, April 30, 2021. The suspension—as in force from January 1, 2021—applies to debtors who, in the period from November 1, 2020 to February 28, 2021, have applied for financial assistance under state assistance programs to mitigate the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic or have been prevented, as eligible debtors, from filing such application for legal or factual reasons, unless the insolvency is not caused by consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and there is obviously no prospect of obtaining the state financial assistance or the assistance that can be obtained is insufficient to eliminate the overindebtedness or illiquidity. The COVInsAG also provides for a certain relief from claw-back provisions, if the debtor fulfilled the requirements for the suspension of filing duties, for the satisfaction of claims or the provision of collateral for these claims, which the creditor was entitled to receive and unless the creditor knew that the restructuring and refinancing efforts of the debtor were not suitable to eliminate an existing illiquidity of the debtor in the meaning of section 17 of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Furthermore, for an interim period until December 31, 2021, the COVInsAG reduces the forecast period (Fortführungsprognose) relevant for determining whether a continuation of the debtor’s business is predominantly likely (überwiegend wahrscheinlich) for the purposes of the assessment of the insolvency ground of over-indebtedness from twelve months to four months provided that the debtor’s over-indebtedness is caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic, which is assumed if (i) the debtor was not cash-flow insolvent as of ----- December 31, 2019, (ii) the debtor’s result from its ordinary business activity was positive in the last financial year prior to January 1, 2020, and (iii) the revenue from the debtors’ ordinary business activity in calendar year 2020 was more than 30% lower than the revenue in calendar year 2019. Unless the debtor has applied for debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) (in which event the court will generally only appoint a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter) who will supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor) the insolvency court will in most cases appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter). The rights and duties of the preliminary administrator depend on the decision of the court. The duties of the preliminary administrator may include safeguarding and preserving the debtor’s property and assessing whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. Depending on the decision of the court, the right to manage the business and dispose of the assets of the debtor may pass to the preliminary insolvency administrator. The insolvency court can also order a stay of all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors against the debtor and other measures the court sees as appropriate. During preliminary insolvency proceedings, the insolvency court has to appoint a “preliminary creditors’ committee” (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss) if the debtor satisfies at least two of the following three requirements: (a) balance sheet total in excess of €6,000,000 (after deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor is over indebted); (b) revenues of at least €12,000,000 in the twelve months prior to the last day of the financial year preceding the filing; and/or (c) fifty or more employees on an annualized average basis. The preliminary creditors’ committee will be able to participate in certain important decisions made in the preliminary insolvency proceedings. It will have, for example, the power to influence the following: the selection of a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter) or an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter); court orders for debtor in possession proceedings (Anordnung der Eigenverwaltung); and appointments of (preliminary) trustees ((vorläufiger) Sachwalter). The court opens formal insolvency proceedings (Eröffnung des Insolvenzverfahrens) if certain formal requirements are met, including if (i) the debtor is in a situation of imminent illiquidity (if the petition has been filed by the debtor), illiquidity and/or over indebted and (ii) if there are sufficient assets to cover at least the cost of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient to cover such costs, the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if third parties (e.g., creditors), advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings will usually be refused for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse). Unless the court has ordered debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) (in which case the court will only appoint a trustee (Sachwalter) who will supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor), upon opening of the insolvency proceedings, the court will appoint an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) who has full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor’s assets, whereas the debtor is no longer entitled to dispose of its assets. The insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) will only be entitled to change the individual appointed as insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first creditors’ assembly (erste _Gläubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by heads and_ amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual to become insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual being eligible as officeholder, i.e., sufficiently qualified, business experienced and impartial. The insolvency administrator (or in the case of debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), the debtor) may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s operations, and satisfaction of these liabilities as preferential debts of the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) will be preferred to any insolvency liabilities created by the debtor including the Guarantees. The insolvency administrator or trustee may also challenge transactions that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the opening of the insolvency proceedings. ----- From the perspective of the holders of the Notes, among others, some important consequences of such opening of formal insolvency proceedings against the Issuer, any Guarantor or any of their relevant subsidiaries that are subject to the German insolvency regime would be the following: - if the court does not order debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung), the right to administer and dispose of the assets of the Issuer, such Guarantor or any of their relevant subsidiaries would generally pass to the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the insolvency estate; - if the court does not order debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) with respect to the Issuer, such Guarantor or any of their relevant subsidiaries, disposals effected by the management of the Issuer, such Guarantor or such subsidiary, after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, are null and void by operation of law; - if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings or thereafter, a creditor in the insolvency proceedings has acquired through execution (e.g., attachment) a security interest in part of the Issuer’s, such Guarantor’s or any of their relevant subsidiaries’ property that would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings; - claims against the Issuer, such Guarantor or any of their relevant subsidiaries may only be pursued in accordance with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) and - any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderung) (i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not constitute part of the insolvency estate) does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for separation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator. Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses”entitling one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement, upon the opening of insolvency proceedings with respect to the other party, the filing for insolvency or the occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene Kündigungsrechte oder _Lösungsklauseln) may be invalid if they frustrate the election right of the insolvency administrator whether or_ not to perform the contract (Wahlrecht des Insolvenzverwalters) unless they reflect termination rights applicable under statutory law. This will likely also relate to agreements that are not governed by German law. All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to separate an asset from the insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht)) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht), wishing to assert claims against the insolvent debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. German insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims in the insolvency proceedings separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Any judicial enforcement action (Zwangsvollstreckung) brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is subject to an automatic stay once insolvency proceedings have been opened. Therefore, secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce any security interest outside the insolvency proceedings. In the insolvency proceedings, however, secured creditors have certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte). Depending on the legal nature of the security interest entitlement to enforce such security is either vested with the secured creditor or the insolvency administrator. In this context, it should be noted that the insolvency administrator generally has the sole right to realize any moveable assets in his/the debtor’s possession which are subject to preferential rights (e.g., liens over movable assets (Mobiliarsicherungsrechte) or security transfer of title (Sicherungsübereignung)) as well as to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). In case the enforcement right is vested with the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the secured assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate, usually add up to 9% of the gross enforcement proceeds plus value added tax (if any), are disbursed to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. With the remaining unencumbered assets of the debtor the insolvency administrator has to satisfy the creditors of the insolvency estate (Massegläubiger) first (including the costs of the insolvency proceedings as well as any preferred liabilities incurred by the insolvency estate after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings). Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims—Insolvenzforderungen), in particular claims of unsecured insolvency creditors and residual claims of secured insolvency creditors reaming after realization of the available collateral (if any), will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is value remaining in the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) after the security interest and the preferential claims against the estate have been settled and paid in full. ----- The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the insolvency administrator from using a movable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency administrator must, however, compensate the creditor for any loss of value resulting from such use. Other than secured and unsecured creditors, German insolvency law provides for certain creditors and their claims to be subordinated by law (including, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor for the repayment of shareholder loans or similar claims), while claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors. Claims of subordinated creditors in the insolvency proceedings (nachrangige Insolvenzgläubiger) are satisfied only after the claims of other non-subordinated creditors (including the unsecured insolvency claims) have been fully satisfied. See also below under “Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims.” During the suspension of filing obligations as set out in the preceding paragraph, the COVInsAG also provides for a relief from lender liability, as any new loans or the provision of collateral for such loans is not regarded against bonos mores. This relief shall include deferrals and “amend & extend” transactions. While in ordinary insolvency proceedings, the value of the Issuer’s, any Guarantor’s or any of their relevant subsidiaries’ assets will be realized by a piecemeal sale or, as the case may be, by a bulk sale of the entity’s business as a going concern, a different approach aiming at the rehabilitation of such entities can be taken based on an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan). Such plan can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and requires, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of the debtor and the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules and the approval of the insolvency court (while a group of dissenting creditors or the debtor can under certain circumstances be crammed down). If the debtor is a corporate entity, also the shares or, as the case may be, the membership rights in the debtor can be included in the insolvency plan, e.g., they can be transferred to third parties, including a transfer or issuance to creditors based on a debt-to-equity swap. Moreover, if the debtor has filed a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings based on an insolvency reason other than illiquidity (i.e., imminent illiquidity or over-indebtedness), combined with a petition to initiate such process based on a debtor-in-possession status and can prove that a restructuring of its business is not obviously futile (offensichtlich aussichtslos), the court may grant a period of up to three months to prepare an insolvency plan for the debtor business (Schutzschirm). In addition, for an interim period until 31 December 2021, debtors have access to the protective shield proceedings (Schutzschirmverfahren) even in the state of illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) provided that the debtor’s illiquidity was caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This is assumed if (i) the debtor was not cash-flow insolvent as of December 31, 2019, (ii) the debtor’s result from its ordinary business activity was positive in the last financial year prior to January 1, 2020, and (iii) the revenue from the debtors’ ordinary business activity in calendar year 2020 was more than 30% lower than the revenue in calendar year 2019. During the respective period granted by the court to prepare the insolvency plan, the creditors’ rights to enforce security may—upon application of the filing debtor—be suspended. Under these circumstances, the insolvency court has to appoint a custodian (Sachwalter) to supervise the process. The debtor is entitled to suggest an individual to be appointed as custodian with such suggestion being binding on the insolvency court unless the suggested person is obviously not eligible to become a custodian (i.e., is obviously not competent or impartial). Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such time unless and until the insolvency administrators opt for performance. Under the German Insolvency Code, the insolvency administrator (or in case of debtor-in-possession proceedings, the custodian) may void (anfechten) transactions, performances or other acts that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the opening of formal insolvency proceedings during applicable voidable periods. Generally, if transactions, performances or other acts are successfully voided by the insolvency administrator or custodian, as the case may be, any amounts or other benefits derived from such challenged transaction, performance or act will have to be returned to the insolvency estate. The administrator’s or custodian’s right to void transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions having occurred up to ten years prior to the filing for the commencement of insolvency proceedings. In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to the Issuer, any Guarantor or any of their relevant subsidiaries based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, the payment of any amounts to the holders as well as the granting of Transaction Security for or providing credit support for the benefit of the Notes could be subject to potential challenges (i.e., clawback rights) by an insolvency administrator or custodian under the rules of voidness (Insolvenzanfechtung) as set out in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). To the extent such a transaction is successfully voided (angefochten), the ----- holders of the Notes, may not be able to recover or retain any amounts under the Notes, the Guarantees or the Transaction Security and may participate in the insolvency proceedings as unsecured creditor only. If payments have already been made under the Notes, the Guarantees or Transaction Security, any amounts received from a transaction that had been voided would have to be repaid to the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse). In this case, the holders of the Notes would only have a general unsecured claim under the Notes or the Guarantees, as applicable, without preference in insolvency proceedings. Against this background, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a legal transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which term includes the granting of a guarantee, the provision of security and the payment of debt) detrimental to the creditors of the debtor may be voided according to the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) in particular in the following cases: - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (a) during the last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings, if the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at the time such act was taken and the creditor knew of such illiquidity (or of circumstances that imperatively suggest that the debtor was illiquid) at such time, or (b) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the creditor knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances imperatively suggesting such illiquidity or filing), whereby in each case an affiliated party shall be presumed to have been aware of the debtor’s insolvency or of the filing to open insolvency proceedings; - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction (Befriedigung) to which such creditor was not entitled or which was granted or obtained in a form in which or at a time at which such creditor was not entitled to such security or satisfaction, if (a) such act was taken during the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or after such filing, (b) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid at such time or (c) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that imperatively suggest such detrimental effect), whereby in each case an affiliated party shall be presumed to have been aware of the detrimental nature of such transaction for the other creditors; - any legal transaction effected by the debtor that directly disadvantages the insolvency creditors or by which the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against the debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable, provided it was entered into (a) during the three months prior to the filing of the petition of the commencement of insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid at the time of such transaction and the other party to such transaction knew of the illiquidity (or of circumstances that imperatively suggest that the debtor was illiquid) at such time or (b) after the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings and the other party to such transaction knew of either the debtor’s illiquidity or such filing (or of circumstances imperatively suggesting such illiquidity or filing) at the time of the transaction, whereby in each case an affiliated party shall be presumed to have been aware of the debtor’s illiquidity or of the filing to open insolvency proceedings; - any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security for a third-party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings; - any act performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing, if the debtor acted with the intention of prejudicing its insolvency creditors (vorsätzliche Gläubigerbenachteiligung) and the beneficiary of the act knew of such intention at the time of such act; in case the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt, the above ten-year period is reduced to four years; “knowledge by the beneficiary of the act” in terms of such provision is presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was imminently illiquid (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors; in case the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was entitled, the “knowledge by the beneficiary of the act” is presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was actually illiquid (eingetretene _Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors; the fact that the creditor_ agreed on a payment plan with the debtor or agreed to deferred payments establishes a presumption that he had no knowledge of the debtor being illiquid at this time; - any non-gratuitous contract (entgeltlicher Vertrag) concluded between the debtor and a related party (nahestehende Person) which directly disadvantages the creditors can be challenged unless such contract ----- was concluded earlier than two years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors as at the time the contract was concluded; - any act that provides security (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for a shareholder loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) made to the debtor or an economically similar claim if (a) in the case of the provision of security (Sicherung), the act took place during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition, or (b) in the case of satisfaction (Befriedigung), the act took place during the last year prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition. - any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a third party if (i) the satisfaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter, and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor or surety (Garant oder Bürge) (in which case the shareholder must compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)). In this context, “knowledge”is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. A person is deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors if he or she knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or imminent illiquidity, as the case may be, and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. With respect to an “affiliated party,” there is a general statutory presumption that such party had “knowledge.” The COVInsAG, however, provides for privileged treatment of new financing and shareholder loans under German insolvency law claw-back provisions during a certain time during the COVID-19 pandemic. On that basis, the repayment (including reasonable interest payments) of third-party financing and shareholder loans by September 30, 2023 shall not be considered disadvantageous to creditors if the relevant financing is granted between March 1, 2020 and April 30, 2021 and the debtor fulfilled the requirements for the suspension of the filing duties at the time. This privilege also covers the provision of collateral in favor of third-party financing providers, but does not apply in case of the provision of collateral to secure the repayment of shareholder loans or receivables resulting from legal transactions which are economically equivalent to a loan. The granting of security concurrently with the incurrence of debt may be qualified as a “cash transaction” and may as such be privileged i.e., under certain circumstances, not being subject to voidness rights under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) (Bargeschäftsprivileg). Apart from the examples of an insolvency administrator or custodian voiding transactions according to the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) described above, a creditor who has obtained an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) could possibly also void any security right or payment performed under the relevant security right according to the German Law of Voidness (Anfechtungsgesetz) outside formal insolvency proceedings. The prerequisites vary to a certain extent from the rules described above and the voidance periods are calculated from the date a creditor exercises its rights of voidance in the courts.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

On an insolvency of a charging company: (a) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have priority as against a floating charge over the same charged assets (provided that the floating charge has not crystallized at the time the fixed charge was granted and there were no restrictions on the creation of such security which the fixed charge holder was aware of); (b) general costs and expenses (including the remuneration of the insolvency officeholders and the costs of continuing to operate the business of the charging company while in administration) properly incurred in an insolvency process are generally payable out of the assets of the charging company (including the assets (including cash) that are the subject of the floating charge) and insolvency officeholders appointed to a charging company can convert floating charge assets to cash and use such cash to meet such general costs and expenses in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder to the extent that the value of the charging company’s unsecured assets is not sufficient to cover such costs and expenses in full; (c) an administrator may dispose of or take action relating to property subject to a floating charge without the prior consent of the charge holder or court, although the floating charge holder retains the same priority in respect of the proceeds from the disposal of the assets subject to the floating charge; (d) where the floating charge is not a “security financial collateral arrangement” (generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended) (the “Financial Collateral Regulations”), floating charge security is subject to the claims of certain preferential creditors and the ring-fencing of the Prescribed Part for unsecured creditors (see “Priority on insolvency” below); and (e) there are particular insolvency “clawback” risks in relation to floating charge security. Please note, however, that with prior approval of the court, an administrator may also deal with property subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the purpose of the administration and that the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal of the property in question towards discharging the obligations of the company to the charge holder. There is a possibility under English law that a court could find that some or all of the fixed security interests expressed to be created by the security documents governed by English law properly take effect as floating charges as the description given to them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether the purported fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than recharacterized as floating security interests will depend, among other things, on whether the secured party has the requisite degree of control over the charging company’s ability to deal with the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the security holder in practice. Where the charging company is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a purported fixed charge in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee, the court would be likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge. If any fixed security interests are recharacterized as floating security interests: (a) the proceeds of those assets could be applied in meeting other liabilities of the company in priority to the claims of the purported fixed charge holder in insolvency proceedings and (b) it is possible that the floating charge security may not relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the property of the relevant company and therefore may not constitute a “qualifying floating charge” (see also “Administration” and “Qualifying floating charge” below).",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

In each case and subject to specific conditions, an administration order can be made if the court is satisfied that (a) the relevant company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” and (b) the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration. A company is unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow”basis (unable to pay its debts as they fall due) or if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities), as per Section 123 of the Insolvency Act. Such insolvency is presumed if, among other matters, the company fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 within 21 days of service or to satisfy in full or in part ----- a judgment debt (or similar court order). The purpose of an administration is comprised of three objectives, each of which must be considered successively: (i) rescuing the company as a going concern or, (ii) if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than would be likely upon immediate liquidation or, (iii) if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors. The order of priority which applies to any distribution to creditors is set out below (see “Priority on insolvency” below). An administrator must attempt to achieve the objectives of administration order, unless he thinks it is not reasonably practicable to achieve the primary objective, or that the secondary objective would achieve a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole. The administrator cannot pursue the third objective unless he thinks either the first or the second objective is unachievable and that it will not unnecessarily harm the interests of the creditors of the company as a whole to pursue the third objective. Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, the debtor company, the directors of such company or the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” (as described in “Qualifying floating charge” below) where the floating charge has become enforceable may appoint an administrator out of court. Different appointment procedures apply according to the identity of the appointor. An administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business of the company to which they are appointed and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration (including property subject to a floating charge). A set proportion of the proceeds of the realization of any property subject to a floating charge will need to be set aside for satisfaction of the claims of preferential creditors and the ringfencing of the Prescribed Part (see “Prescribed Part” below). An administrator may also, with prior approval by the court, deal with assets subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the purpose of the administration and the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal towards discharging the obligations of the company to the fixed charge holder. In addition, certain rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration. Upon the appointment of an administrator, a statutory moratorium is imposed and no step may be taken to enforce security or a guarantee over the company’s property except with the consent of the administrator or leave of the court (although a demand for payment could be made under a guarantee granted by the company). The same requirements for consent or permission apply to the institution or continuation of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress and diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will consider discretionary factors in determining any application for leave in light of the hierarchy of statutory objectives of administration described above. However, certain creditors of a company in administration may, in certain defined circumstances, be able to realize their security over certain of that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to a “security financial collateral arrangement” (generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Regulations. Accordingly, if the English Obligors were to enter into administration, the Guarantees and/or the Collateral provided by the English Obligors may not be enforceable without the permission of the court or consent of the administrator while the English Obligors were in administration. There can be no assurance that the Security Agent would obtain such permission of the court or consent of the administrator.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

A floating charge qualifies if it is created by an instrument which (a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it (paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 of the Insolvency Act); (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company; or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act.

If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference or an invalid floating charge.

If appointed under the terms of a security agreement, grounds for appointment under the terms of the charge (such as a default) must exist and the charging company must have failed to satisfy the demand made for an appointment to take place. A fixed charge receiver can be appointed in parallel to a liquidator. An administrator may require a fixed charge receiver to vacate office unless that fixed charge receiver was appointed under a charge which falls within the definition of a “security financial collateral arrangement,” as per Reg. 8(4) of the Financial Collateral Regulations (see “Administration” above). The primary duty of the fixed charge receiver is to realize the assets over which (s)he is appointed, meaning (s)he owes an over-riding duty of care to the appointor. This contrasts with the duty of an administrator, who performs his/her duties in the interests of a company’s creditors as a whole. In other words, receivership is a proprietary remedy whereas administration is a collective procedure. In realizing the charged assets, the receiver will need to take reasonable care to obtain the best price obtainable in the circumstances. In doing so, the fixed charge receiver will be entitled to a statutory indemnity in respect of any liabilities from the realizations made of the assets of the company (and may also have the benefit of a contractual indemnity from the appointor). To the extent the receiver has been appointed under a crystallized floating charge, amounts will be deducted from the proceeds of the realization of the charged assets to pay the Prescribed Part and any preferential creditors (see “Fixed versus floating charge” above).",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

The English Obligors may be able to pursue a scheme in respect of its financial liabilities. In addition, the English courts have jurisdiction to sanction a scheme of arrangement in respect of a foreign obligor which (a) is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act and (b) has a “sufficient connection” to England and Wales. In practice, a foreign company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb has been found to be satisfied where, amongst other things, the company’s COMI is in England, the company’s finance documents are English law governed or the company’s finance documents have been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by ----- English law. Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not any of the grounds of the second limb are satisfied in the present case. Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given under the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If a majority in number representing 75% or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s) of each class of creditors vote in favour of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and those who voted against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether it is reasonable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or reject the scheme.

While generally available to the same domestic and foreign companies as schemes of arrangement, a company seeking to enter into a restructuring plan process must show that (a) it has encountered, or is likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern, and (b) a compromise or arrangement has been proposed between the company and its creditors (or any class of them) whose purpose it is to eliminate, reduce or prevent, or mitigate the effect of, any of those financial difficulties. A restructuring plan may be proposed by the debtor company, any creditor of the company or any liquidator or administrator appointed to the company. As with a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes depending on the rights of such creditors which will be affected by the proposed restructuring plan and any new rights that such creditors are given under the restructuring plan. A restructuring plan will be deemed to be approved if at least 75% in value of the creditors present and voting at the meeting of at least one class of creditors vote in favour of the proposed compromise, there is no requirement for the approving creditors to constitute a majority in number of those creditors present and voting, and there is crucially no requirement for each and every voting class to approve of the plan, provided that the court is satisfied that (a) none of the members of a dissenting class would be any worse off if the restructuring plan were to be sanctioned than they would be in the event of the ‘relevant alternative’ and (b) the restructuring plan was approved by at least one class of creditors who would receive a payment or have a genuine economic interest in the company in the event of the ‘relevant alternative’. The ‘relevant alternative’ for the purposes of this assessment is whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the restructuring plan were not sanctioned. By virtue of these mechanics, the restructuring plan process provides for the possibility of a ‘cross-class cram-down’, meaning the courts may sanction a restructuring plan even if one or more classes of affected creditors do not vote in favour of the restructuring plan, effectively allowing the vote of one class of stakeholders to bind other classes. Following approval of the restructuring plan at the creditor meeting(s), the restructuring plan needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review whether the applicable statutory conditions have been met and consider whether the restructuring plan is just and equitable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the restructuring plan as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or reject the restructuring plan. Courts are likely to pay particular attention to the fairness and equity of any cross-class cram-down effected by the proposed arrangement. Once sanctioned, the restructuring plan binds all affected stakeholders whose rights will be as set out in the restructuring plan. As with schemes of arrangement, the commencement of a restructuring plan process does not automatically trigger a moratorium on claims or proceedings. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

There are two forms of winding-up: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court; and (b) members’ voluntary liquidation or creditors’ voluntary liquidation, in each case by resolution of the company’s members. The difference between the two latter proceedings is the solvency of the company in question; in a members’ voluntary liquidation, the directors of the company swear a statutory declaration as to the company’s solvency over the following 12 months whereas the primary ground for the creditors’ voluntary liquidation of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act—see “Administration” above). Note that while a creditors’ voluntary liquidation (other than as an exit from administration) is initiated by a resolution of the members, not the creditors, once in place the process is subject to some degree of control by the creditors. Whereas compulsory liquidation and creditors’ voluntary liquidation proceedings are available to foreign companies with sufficient nexus to the UK in addition to companies within the English courts’general jurisdiction (see “Applicable legal _framework and jurisdiction of the English courts”above), members’ voluntary liquidation proceedings are only_ available to companies registered in England, Wales or Scotland. The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary winding-up. In a compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act any disposition of the relevant company’s property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. However, this will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement under the Financial Collateral Regulations and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in accordance with its terms. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced at the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition (but note “Statutory demands and winding-up petitions” below). Once a winding-up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will be imposed. No action or proceeding may be continued or commenced against the company without permission of the court and subject to such terms as the court may impose although there is no freeze on the enforcement of security. In the context of a voluntary winding-up, however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary winding-up—it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or contributory of the company, to apply for a stay to prevent the continuation of legal proceedings and enforcement of security. A liquidator has the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the company’s property and execute documents in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions (see “Avoidance _of Transactions” below)._ In light of the coronavirus pandemic, legislation has been introduced which temporarily restricts the ability of creditors to present winding-up petitions and of courts to grant winding-up orders. While these measures remain in place, (a) winding-up petitions on the basis of a company’s inability to satisfy a statutory demands alone are void if the relevant statutory demands were served between March 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021, and (b) where winding-up petitions are presented between April 27, 2020 and June 30, 2021 based on other grounds, the petitioning creditor must show that it had reasonable grounds to believe that coronavirus has not had a financial effect on the company or that the company’s inability to pay its debts would have arisen even if coronavirus had not had such effect on the company. Between April 27, 2020 and June 30, 2021, a court may similarly only grant a winding-up order in circumstances where a company is deemed unable to pay its debts and it appears to the court that coronavirus has had a financial effect on the company before the presentation of the petition if the court is satisfied that the company’s insolvency would have arisen even if coronavirus had not had such effect on the company.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

In accordance with the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency Rules, creditors are placed into different classes, with the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s property applied in descending order of ----- priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined below), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior-ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise with the company, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class. Contractual setting-off arrangements entered into after a company enters liquidation or administration are only respected to the extent they fall within the definition of “mutual dealing” as applied by the mandatory insolvency set-off regime. This regime sees an account being taken of what is due from each party to the other in respect of their mutual dealings, and only the resulting net balance is either provable by the creditor in the administration or liquidation of the company (if amounts remain due to the creditor) or, conversely, is payable by the creditor to the company (if amounts remain due to the company). The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority): - First ranking: holders of fixed charge security (but only to the extent the value of the secured assets covers that indebtedness); - Second ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which expenses are paid); - Third ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors. Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (a) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (b) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; and (c) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the date of insolvency. As between one another, ordinary preferential debts rank equally. Secondary preferential debts rank for payment after the discharge of ordinary preferential debts and include claims by HMRC in respect of certain taxes including VAT, PAYE income tax (including student loan repayments), employee NI contributions and Construction Industry Scheme deductions (but excluding corporation tax and employer NI contributions) which are held by the company on behalf of employees and customers. As between one another, secondary preferential debts rank equally; - Fourth ranking: holders of floating charge security, to the extent of the realizations from those secured assets, according to the priority of their security. This would include any security interest that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which, on proper interpretation by the court, was rendered a floating charge. However, before distributing asset realizations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part (as defined below) must, subject to certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors; - Fifth ranking: - firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and (to the extent of any unsecured shortfall) secured creditors, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay the secured creditors any unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realisations from unsecured assets as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors; - secondly, interest on the company’s debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the rate determined in accordance with the Judgments Act 1838 (currently 8% per annum)) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation or after the commencement of an administration which has been converted into a distributing administration. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the Notes or the Notes Guarantees, such interest due to the holders of the Notes may, if there are sufficient realizations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries; and - thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully repaid; and - Sixth ranking: shareholders. If, after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company. Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the subordination language in the relevant documentation. ----- An insolvency practitioner of the company (e.g., an administrator, administrative receiver or liquidator) will generally be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for the benefit of unsecured creditors (after making full provision for preferential creditors and expenses out of floating charge realizations) (the “Prescribed Part”). This ring-fence applies to (a) 50% of the first £10,000 of the company’s net property and (b) 20% of the remainder of the company’s net property over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 (except where the company’s net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first-ranking floating charge created before April 6, 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate cap is £600,000). The Prescribed Part must be made available to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

A transaction will only be a transaction at an undervalue if, at the time of the transaction or as a consequence of the transaction, the English company is unable to pay its debts or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the onset of the English company’s insolvency is within a period of two years from the date the English company grants the security interest or the guarantee. A transaction may be set aside as a transaction at an undervalue if the company made a gift to a person, if the company received no consideration or if the company received consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company. However, a court shall not make an order if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit it. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court shall make such order as it sees fit to restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to show that the English company was unable to pay its debts unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (see “Connected persons” above), in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the connected person must demonstrate that the company was not unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction or became unable to do so as a consequence of the transaction. An order by the court for a transaction at an undervalue may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person with whom the company entered into the transaction, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the English company in good faith and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the person was a party to the transaction.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

It will only be a preference if, at the time of the transaction or in consequence of the transaction, the English company is unable to pay its debts or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the English company enters into insolvency within a period of six months (if the beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) from the date the English company grants the security interest or the guarantee constituting the preference. A transaction may constitute a preference if a transaction has the effect of putting a creditor of the English company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation) than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into.

More specifically, such a transaction must be allowed by the respective company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that these documents do not ----- allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee and the subsequent security can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with the English Obligors in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for the English Obligors in question by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in a way that he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found to be abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court. Section 172(3) of the Companies Act 2006 additionally provides that, in certain circumstances, the directors need to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company. While the statutory provisions do not prescribe when directors’ duties to creditors arise, the English courts have held that the shift takes place when the directors know, or should know, that the company in question is or is likely to become insolvent, with “likely” in this context meaning “probable.” Security and/or guarantees granted by the English Obligors may also be subject to potential limitations to the extent they would result in unlawful financial assistance contrary to English company law. _Security registration_ Under English company law, subject to limited exceptions, any security granted by a charging company incorporated in England and Wales (including security governed by law other than English law) (together with prescribed particulars of the relevant security) may be delivered to the Registrar of Companies for registration within 21 days after the date of creation of the relevant security interest. While the Companies Act 2006 does not impose an obligation as such on English companies to register security created on or after April 6, 2013, security will be deemed to be void against a liquidator, administrator and any creditor of the applicable charging company if not registered within the 21-day period. When security becomes so void, the debt, which was intended to be secured by such security, is deemed to become immediately payable. In limited circumstances, it may be possible to apply to the English courts for an order to rectify a failure to register and allow the relevant charge to be registered after the 21-day period has expired. Security created on or after 1 October 2011 by overseas companies over assets in England and Wales does not need to be registered with the Registrar of Companies. Registration with applicable asset registries may, however, still be required depending on the nature of the collateral assets. _Moratoriums_ As outlined above, certain of the insolvency processes available in England and Wales provide for the automatic or optional moratorium imposing a period of time during which third parties including creditors are unable to institute or continue legal action against the company, enforce certain rights and/or call upon security or guarantees. Besides the moratorium available to companies undergoing administration (see “Administration” above), moratoriums are also available to companies entering liquidation (see “Liquidation/ _winding-up” above). Restriction on the operation and exercise of ipso facto provisions_ Changes to the Insolvency Act have introduced a restriction on the operation and exercise of ipso facto clauses in order to preserve the continuity of the provision of goods and services to companies undergoing insolvency procedures. In general terms, ipso facto clauses are provisions in supply of goods or services contracts which allow suppliers to terminate the contract or supply or take any other action, or provide for the automatic termination of the contract or supply or the occurrence of any other event, upon the counterparty entering an insolvency procedure. Under the new approach, to the extent that the trigger event is the counterparty’s entry into a ‘relevant insolvency procedure’(i.e. an administration, administrative receivership, company voluntary arrangement, liquidation and/or a restructuring plan), such clauses will be deemed void and suppliers will be unable to terminate the relevant contracts unless the company or the relevant officeholder consents to the termination or the court grants permission on the basis that it is satisfied that the continuation of the contract would cause the supplier hardship. The restrictions do not apply to a range of contracts involving financial services or entities involved in the provision of financial services, including contracts for the provision of lending, financial leasing or guarantees, contracts for the purchase, sale or loan of securities or commodities and agreements which are, or form part ----- of, arrangements involving the issue of a capital market investment (as defined in the Insolvency Act). In light of the coronavirus pandemic, certain small suppliers are also temporarily excluded from the restrictions where the counterparty enters into relevant insolvency procedures prior to 30 June 2021 (unless extended further).",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

Unless insolvency proceedings or certain related proceedings were opened prior to the expiry of the Transition Period, in which case the unmodified EU Insolvency Regulation and related EU insolvency legislation govern the proceedings, insolvency proceedings with respect to the English Obligors would likely proceed under, and be governed by, English insolvency laws in force at the time of commencement of the relevant proceedings. However, to the extent that an English Obligor has its “centre of main interests”(“COMI”) in a member state of the EU, insolvency proceedings could, pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation and subject to certain exceptions, be opened in the relevant EU member state and be subject to the laws of that EU member state (see “European Union” above). In addition, pursuant to the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations, certain foreign courts may have jurisdiction to oversee insolvency proceedings of any English Obligor which has its COMI or an “establishment” (being a place of operations where it carries out a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets or services) in such foreign jurisdiction. Although the scope of the English courts’ jurisdiction varies for the different insolvency proceedings available in England and Wales, English courts generally have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in respect of any company which has its COMI in the UK or which has its COMI in an EU member state (other than Denmark) and an “establishment”in the UK. An “establishment”is defined in the same way as under the EU Insolvency Regulation (see “European Union” above). While this allows English courts to assume jurisdiction over certain foreign companies in respect of certain insolvency proceedings, the efficacy of such proceedings will significantly depend on the likelihood and extent of subsequent recognition of such proceedings in relevant other jurisdictions (see “Cross-border recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings” below). English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. In the event that the English Obligors experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. The obligations under the Notes are guaranteed by the Guarantees and secured by security interests over the Collateral. English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of a Guarantee against the English Obligors or security interests over the Collateral. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to certain limitations on the Guarantees and the security interests over the Collateral. The application of these laws could adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce their rights under the Guarantees and/or under the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of the English Obligors.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

The Model Law provides for recognition of certain UK insolvency proceedings in other signatory states as either foreign main proceedings (if COMI of the relevant debtor is determined to be in the United Kingdom) or foreign nonmain proceedings (if COMI is determined to be in another jurisdiction but the debtor has an establishment in the United Kingdom). The Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations only provide for recognition of proceedings under UK insolvency law, which in relation to England and Wales covers proceedings initiated under the Insolvency Act other than receivership proceedings and members’voluntary liquidations, and does not extend to restructuring processes governed by corporate law such as schemes of arrangement. The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of schemes of arrangement, which are restructuring rather than insolvency proceedings, will be subject to treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements 2005 and the Lugano Convention 2007 (subject to the United Kingdom’s pending accession to the latter) where these apply. _Recognition in the European Union_ Following the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union and the expiry of the Transition Period, UK proceedings no longer benefit from automatic and guaranteed recognition in EU member states. As the trade and cooperation terms agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom do not include a replacement regime for the current automatic recognition of UK insolvency procedures across the European Union (and vice versa) or otherwise address insolvency matters, cross-border insolvencies involving the United Kingdom and one or more EU member states will be subject to a degree of uncertainty and increased complexity. Unless or until a mutual recognition agreement is reached in the future, it is likely to be more problematic for UK restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in EU member states and for UK office holders to effectively deal with assets located in EU member states. The general position outlined above will apply and recognition will depend on the private international law rules adopted in the relevant EU member state and the need may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk as well as costs. In particular in cases where the appointment of a UK office holder is made in reliance on a UK domestic approach rather than COMI rules, it is much less certain that such appointment will be recognized in other EU member states. As a consequence, the recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings across the EU member states may be different from what investors may have experienced in the past when the United Kingdom was a member state of the European Union. It is not possible to predict with certainty if and to what extent proceedings will be recognized and whether investors may be adversely affected as a result.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

The US Bankruptcy Code provides a detailed statutory framework that, among other things, contains terms or provisions relating to: (i) the administration of a bankruptcy case, including the imposition of an automatic stay to enjoin most litigation, enforcement, and other actions against a debtor or its property, terms for the use, sale or lease of estate property, standards for obtaining post-petition credit, and the treatment of executory contracts and unexpired leases; (ii) the treatment of creditors and claims, including deadlines and requirements for filing proofs of claim, the priority and allowance of claims, subordination of claims, and the provision of “adequate protection” to secured creditors to protect against diminution in their collateral position; and (iii) the creation of the bankruptcy estate, including the scope of property of the estate and turnover and avoidance actions. Proceedings under the US Bankruptcy Code vary. As a general matter, Chapter 7 of the US Bankruptcy Code provides for the orderly liquidation of the debtor’s assets by a court-appointed trustee and typically results in the immediate shutdown of the debtor’s business. Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code provides a debtor with more discretion in its pursuit of a reorganization or liquidation strategy and is available to debtors who seek to continue to operate their businesses as a going concern while they rehabilitate their businesses and work out their obligations to creditors or, alternatively, seek to liquidate in an orderly fashion, in each case pursuant to a plan of reorganization or liquidation, as applicable. Unlike in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case, in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy case the debtor typically remains in possession of its assets and continues to operate its business during the course of the bankruptcy case, subject to the supervision of a US bankruptcy court, as a debtor-in-possession with substantially the rights that a trustee would otherwise have. Because bankruptcy proceedings tend to be fact specific and vary case by case, and because US bankruptcy courts are courts of equity with broad discretionary powers, a detailed summary of all of the provisions of the US Bankruptcy Code that could impact the Notes and/or the Guarantees is not contained herein. Furthermore, the common law applicable in bankruptcy proceedings may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and this summary is not intended to cover the common law that may apply in any particular jurisdiction. With respect to proceedings under other applicable state insolvency laws (e.g., assignments for the benefit of creditors, receiverships or other state liquidation mechanisms), the effects of such proceedings are factspecific, vary from state to state, and require an examination of both statutory and common law, the details of which also are not described herein.

Provisions of the US Bankruptcy Code or general principles of equity that could result in the delay and/or impairment of rights of the Holders of the Notes include, but are not limited to: - the automatic stay; - the ability of a trustee or debtor-in-possession, or other parties granted standing by the bankruptcy court including a creditor or creditors, to commence actions to avoid transfers of interests in assets or incurrences of obligations as fraudulent or preferential transfers; - potential substantive consolidation of the assets and liabilities of multiple entities, including the Issuer and one or more Guarantors; - limitations on the collectability of unmatured interest on the Notes or attorneys’ fees of counsel to Holders of the Notes; and ----- - a potential forced restructuring which would not pay the Notes in full in cash (and/or would reduce the interest rate or extend the maturity of the Notes) and could convert the Notes into equity or other forms of consideration, or potentially discharge the obligations without significant recovery, in each case over the objections of holders of the Notes. As an initial matter, the commencement of a bankruptcy case operates as an automatic stay, applicable to most creditors, of most litigation against the debtor and efforts to collect prepetition claims, enforce existing liens or impose most new liens. The automatic stay is very broad, purporting to have worldwide effect, and the purpose of the stay is to provide the Chapter 11 debtor time to reorganize or the Chapter 7 trustee protection under which to liquidate in an orderly fashion the debtor’s assets for the benefit of creditors, and to avoid a “race to the courthouse”by creditors. The automatic stay is also intended to shield a debtor from the pressures of creditor collection efforts. Among other things, the automatic stay generally prohibits (i) collection efforts by creditors, (ii) the enforcement of prepetition judgments against the debtor or property of the estate, (iii) any act to create, perfect or enforce a lien against property of the estate, (iv) the set-off of prepetition debts owing to the debtor against debts owing by the debtor, and (v) the commencement or continuation of most judicial, administrative or other proceedings against the debtor based upon a prepetition claim. The automatic stay ordinarily does not bar suits against non-debtor guarantors or co-obligors.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, a US Provider would be considered insolvent if: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than all of its assets, at a fair valuation; - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liabilities on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they become due. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court may apply in making solvency determinations and different courts may reach different conclusions with regard to these issues. In an evidentiary ruling in the _In re W.R. Grace & Co. bankruptcy case, the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware held that_ under the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, whether a transferor is rendered insolvent by a transfer depends on the actual liabilities of the transferor and not what the transferor knows about such liabilities at the time of the transfer. Therefore, under that court’s analysis, liabilities that are unknown, or that are known to exist but whose magnitude is not fully appreciated at the time of the transfer, may be taken into account in the context of a future determination of insolvency. If the principle articulated by that court is upheld, it would make it very difficult to know whether a transferor is solvent at the time of transfer and would increase the risk that a transfer may in the future be found to be a fraudulent transfer. By their terms, the Guarantees of each US Provider will limit the liability of each such guarantor to the maximum amount it can pay without the Guarantee being deemed a fraudulent transfer. It is not assured, however, that this limitation will protect such guarantees from fraudulent transfer challenges or, if it does, that the remaining amount due and collectible under the guarantees would suffice, if necessary, to pay the ----- Notes in full when due. In at least one bankruptcy case, this kind of provision was found to be ineffective to protect the guarantees at issue. Pledges of collateral by a Guarantor in a favor of the Holders of the Notes to secure the debt incurred thereby might similarly be avoided as fraudulent transfers. In addition to the avoidance power that may be exercised in a US bankruptcy, claims in respect of liens or obligations evidenced by the Guarantees may, in certain circumstances, be subordinated under the equitable subordination provisions of the US Bankruptcy Code.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

With respect to foreign money judgments, recognition and enforceability will be governed by applicable state law. A majority of US states have adopted a version of the Uniform Foreign Money Judgments Recognition Act (or a later revision thereof) (the “US Uniform Act”). Although variations exist among states, the US Uniform Act generally applies to any judgment granting or denying recovery of a sum of money rendered in a foreign jurisdiction (excluding judgments for taxes, fines, penalties and a judgment for support in matrimonial or family matters), so long as the judgment is final, conclusive and enforceable in the jurisdiction where rendered. Pursuant to the US Uniform Act, any such foreign judgment rendered by a court having proper personal and subject matter jurisdiction would, subject to considerations of public policy, be recognized and enforced by a United States state court that has adopted the US Uniform Act (or a federal court sitting in such a state) and that also has appropriate personal and subject matter jurisdiction without re-examination of the merits of the case pursuant to which such foreign judgment was obtained and in the same manner as the judgment of a sister state that is entitled to full faith and credit, in an appropriate proceeding in accordance with the procedures of such court, provided that (i) the judgment debtor had received proper and sufficient notice of the subject proceedings in sufficient time to defend itself in such proceedings, (ii) the judgment was not obtained by fraud; (iii) the judgment was not rendered under a system which does not provide impartial tribunals or procedures compatible with the requirements of due process of law; (iv) the cause of action on which the judgment is based is not repugnant to the public policy of the state in which the judgment creditor is seeking recognition; (v) the proceedings in the foreign court were not contrary to an agreement between the parties under which the dispute in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in that court; (vi) the foreign court was not a seriously inconvenient forum for the trial of the action if jurisdiction over the judgment debtor was based only on personal service; and (vii) the judgment did not conflict with another final and conclusive judgment. In addition to the foregoing, a number of states adopting the US Uniform Act also require that the foreign court rendering the judgment reside in a jurisdiction that will reciprocally enforce judgments of United States courts. In states that have not adopted the US Uniform Act, principles of comity will apply. The Uniform Act represents an attempt to codify general principles of comity and should therefore be generally indicative of the types of principles that non-US Uniform Law states would apply in determining whether to recognize a foreign judgment against the US Providers. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

The personal income tax liability of an individual holder who is a tax resident in Germany on income from capital investments under the Additional Notes will, in principle, be satisfied by the tax withheld. To the extent withholding tax has not been levied, such as in the case no Disbursing Agent being involved in the payment process, the individual holder must include his or her income and capital gains derived from the Additional Notes in his or her tax return and will then also be taxed at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable, church tax thereon). If the withholding tax on a disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment has been calculated from 30% of the disposal proceeds (rather than from the actual gain), an individual holder may, and in case the actual gain is higher than 30% of the disposal proceeds, must apply for an assessment on the basis of his or her actual acquisition costs. Further, an individual holder may apply for a tax assessment on the basis of general rules applicable to him or her if the resulting individual income tax burden is lower than 25% with any amounts of German tax over-withheld being refunded. The deduction of expenses (other than transaction costs) on an itemized basis is not permitted. Losses incurred with respect to the Additional Notes may only be offset with investment income of the individual holder realized in the same or following assessment periods, in some cases subject to certain limitations. Capital losses from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Additional Notes held as private assets should generally be tax-recognized irrespective of the holding period of the Additional Notes. The losses may, however, not be used to offset other income like employment or business income but may only be offset against investment income subject to certain limitations. Losses not utilized in one year may be carried ----- forward into subsequent years but may not be carried back into preceding years. However, if the losses result from the full or partial non-recoverability of the repayment claim under the Additional Notes including a default of the Issuer or a (voluntary) waiver, such losses together with other losses of such kind of the same year and loss-carry forwards of previous years can only be offset up to an amount of EUR 20,000 (“Limitation",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

If Additional Notes kept or administered in the same custodial account were acquired at different points in time, the Additional Notes first acquired will be deemed to have been sold first for the purposes of determining any capital gains. The separation of interest claims from the Additional Notes is treated as disposal of the Additional Notes at their fair market value which has to be apportioned to the capital and the interest coupons. If interest claims or interest coupons are disposed of separately (i.e., without the Additional Notes), the proceeds from the disposal are subject to withholding tax. The same applies to proceeds from the redemption or collection of interest claims or interest coupons if the Additional Notes have been disposed of separately. To the extent that the Additional Notes have not been kept or administered in a custodial account with the same Disbursing Agent since the time of their acquisition, upon the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment withholding tax applies at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being 26.375%, plus church tax, if applicable) on 30% of the disposal proceeds (including Accrued Interest if any), unless the current Disbursing Agent has been provided with evidence of the actual acquisition costs of the Additional Notes by the previous Disbursing Agent or by a statement of a bank or financial services institution within the European Union, the European Economic Area or certain other countries, e.g., Switzerland. In computing any German withholding tax, the Disbursing Agent may generally deduct from the basis of the withholding tax negative investment income realized by the individual holder of the Additional Notes via the Disbursing Agent (e.g., losses from the sale of other capital investments with the exception of shares). The Disbursing Agent may also deduct Accrued Interest on the Additional Notes or other securities paid separately upon the acquisition of the respective security via the Disbursing Agent. In addition, subject to certain ----- requirements and restrictions, the Disbursing Agent may credit foreign withholding taxes levied on investment income in a given year regarding securities held by the individual holder in the custodial account with the Disbursing Agent. Upon the individual holder filing an exemption certificate (Freistellungsauftrag) with the Disbursing Agent, the Disbursing Agent will take a maximum annual allowance (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of €801 (€1,602 for married couples and for partners in accordance with the registered partnership law (Gesetz über die _Eingetragene Lebenspartnerschaft) filing jointly) into account when computing the amount of tax to be_ withheld from the gross payment to be made by the Disbursing Agent. No withholding tax will be deducted if the holder of the Additional Notes has submitted to the Disbursing Agent a certificate of non-assessment (Nichtveranlagungsbescheinigung) issued by the competent tax office. German withholding tax will generally not apply to gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of Additional Notes held by a corporate holder who is a German tax resident (including via a commercial partnership, as the case may be, and provided that in the case of corporations of certain legal forms the status of corporation has been evidenced by a certificate of the competent tax office) while ongoing payments, such as interest payments, are generally subject to withholding tax (irrespective of any deductions of foreign tax and losses incurred). The same applies where the Additional Notes form part of a German trade or business (of an individual or a commercial partnership) subject to further requirements being met. Interest and capital gains on the Additional Notes received by non-residents of Germany are, in general, not subject to German withholding tax or the solidarity surcharge thereon. However, where the interest or capital gain is subject to German taxation (as set forth under “— Taxation of Current Income and Capital Gains— _Non Tax Residents”) and the Additional Notes are held in a custodial account with a Disbursing Agent,_ withholding tax will be levied under certain circumstances.

Pursuant to the legislative reasoning, a nonrecoverability shall also be assumed if, based on the overall assessment of the facts and circumstances, it becomes apparent that the Issuer will not redeem the Additional Notes in full, e.g. because the solvency risk has already materialized. Given that the Limitation on Loss Deduction will not be applied by the German Disbursing Agent (as defined above) holding the Additional Notes in custody, holders suffering losses which are subject to the Limitation on Loss Deduction are required to declare such losses in their income tax return. Where Additional Notes form part of a trade or business of an individual or corporate holder or where the income from the Additional Notes qualifies as income from the letting and leasing of property, the withholding tax, if any, will not satisfy the personal or corporate income tax liability. Rather, the income is subject to individual or corporate income tax (plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable, church tax thereon). Where Additional Notes form part of a trade or business, interest (including Accrued Interest) and capital gains must be taken into account as income. The respective holder will have to include income and related (business) expenses in the tax return and the balance will be taxed at the holder’s applicable tax rate. Withholding tax levied, if any, will be credited as advance payment against the personal or corporate income tax liability of the holder or, to the extent exceeding this personal or corporate income tax liability, will be refunded. Where Additional Notes form part of a German trade or business the current income and capital gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Additional Notes may also be subject to German trade tax (Gewerbesteuer). The trade tax liability depends on the municipal trade tax factor (Gewerbesteuerhebesatz). If the holder is an individual or an individual partner of a partnership, the trade tax may be completely or partly credited against the personal income tax pursuant to a lump sum tax credit method. _Non Tax Residents_ This subsection “— Non Tax Residents” refers to persons who are not tax residents of Germany (i.e., persons whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, and place of effective management is not located in Germany). Interest, including accrued interest, and capital gains (which include currency gains and losses, if any) from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Additional Notes received by holders who are not tax resident in Germany are generally not subject to German taxation, unless (i) the Additional Notes form part of the business property of a permanent establishment, including a permanent representative, or a fixed base maintained in Germany by the holder or (ii) the income otherwise constitutes German source income. Furthermore, the holders who are not tax resident in Germany may become subject to German withholding tax in case they receive the proceeds by way of an over-the-counter payment by a German Disbursing Agent and the Additional Notes are not held in custody with the same German Disbursing Agent. To the extent the German source income is subject to German withholding tax, this withholding tax is, in general final and the German tax liability is satisfied by the tax withheld. Where the German source income is not subject to German withholding tax or in case (i) of this paragraph (i.e., if Additional Notes form part of the business property of a German permanent establishment), a tax regime similar to that explained above under “— Tax _Residents” applies.

If the IRS successfully challenged our position, the Additional Notes and the Original Notes may not be fungible for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition U.S. holders could be required to accrue original issue discount or interest income on the Additional Notes at a rate different from their yield to maturity and to treat as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, any gain recognized on a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of an Additional Note.

Amortizable bond premium should generally be treated as a reduction of interest on the Additional Note, as applicable instead of as a deduction. Amortizable bond premium will be computed in euro. A US holder making the election to amortize bond premium may recognize exchange gain or loss each period equal to the difference between the US dollar value of bond premium with respect to such period determined on the date the interest attributable to such period is received and the US dollar value of such amortized bond premium determined on the date of the acquisition of the Additional Notes. The Additional Notes are subject to call provisions at our option at various times. A US holder generally will calculate the amount of amortizable bond premium based on the amount payable at the applicable call date, but only if use of the call date (in lieu of the stated maturity date) results in a smaller amortizable bond premium for the period ending on the call date. In the event that the Issuer does not exercise its call rights on such call date, the Additional Note generally should be treated as reissued on the call date for the call price, and the US holder will recalculate the amount of any amortizable bond premium on such Additional Note pursuant to the principles described above. The foregoing rules may eliminate, reduce or defer any amortization deductions. A US holder that elects to amortize bond premium must reduce its tax basis in the Additional Note by the amount of the amortized bond premium used to offset stated interest income as set forth above.

A US holder that uses the cash method of accounting for US federal income tax purposes and that receives a payment of stated interest on the Additional Notes will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the US dollar value of the euro interest payment (translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received) regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to US dollars at such time. A cash method US holder will not recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such interest, but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the euro so received. A US holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for US federal income tax purposes (or who otherwise is required to accrue interest prior to receipt) will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the US dollar value of the amount of stated interest income in euro that has accrued with respect to its Additional Notes during an accrual period. The US dollar value of such euro denominated accrued interest will be determined by translating such amount at the average spot rate of exchange for the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average spot rate of exchange for the partial period within each taxable year.

Alternatively, if the last day of an accrual period is within five business days of the date of receipt of the accrued interest, a US holder that has made the election described in the prior sentence may translate such interest at the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt of the interest.

The cost of an Additional Note purchased with foreign currency will generally be the US dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price translated at the spot rate on the date of purchase. If the applicable Additional Note is treated as traded on an established securities market and the relevant US holder is either a cash basis taxpayer or an accrual basis taxpayer who has made the special election described below, such US holder will determine the US dollar value of the cost of such Additional Note by translating the amount paid at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase. If a US holder receives foreign currency on such a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of an Additional Note, the amount realized generally will be based on the US dollar value of such foreign currency translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of disposition.

The special election available to accrual basis US holders in regard to the purchase or disposition of Additional Notes traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the US holder and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis US holder that does not make the special election will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute US source ordinary income or loss. Gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of an Additional Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of such Additional Note generally will be US source ordinary income or loss and generally will not be treated as interest income or expense.

In addition, upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a US holder may recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest, which will be treated as discussed above under “— Payments of Stated Interest”.

Accordingly, a beneficial owner of an Additional Note that is neither a US holder nor a partnership for US federal income tax purposes (a “non-US holder”) should not be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax with respect to the Additional Notes. However, because, a substantial portion of the net proceeds of this Offering is expected to be directly or indirectly on-lent by the Issuer to a US subsidiary and used in the United States to fund the Acquisition, the IRS may successfully assert that there is a potential tax avoidance plan and that all or a portion of any payment of interest on the Additional Notes should be treated as from sources within the United States for US federal income tax purposes. In that case, a non-US holder may be subject to US federal withholding tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower treaty rate) with respect to interest payments on the Additional Notes unless certain certification requirements have been fulfilled (such as providing applicable ----- IRS W-8 Forms), and the Additional Notes will not be fungible with the Original Notes for US federal income tax purposes. We have not sought and will not seek any rulings from the IRS with respect to the tax treatment of the Additional Notes and there can be no assurance the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position concerning the tax treatment described in this paragraph. In that connection, each holder and beneficial owner of the Additional Notes that acquires its Additional Notes pursuant to this Offering, by its purchase and acceptance of such Notes, will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented to and agreed with the Issuer and the Initial Purchaser as follows: (i) if such holder or beneficial owner is not a United States person as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, (i) such holder or beneficial owner qualifies for an exemption from US federal withholding tax with respect to payments of interest pursuant to an applicable income tax treaty to which the United States is a party; or (ii)(x) such holder or beneficial owner does not, actually or constructively, own 10% or more of the Issuer’s voting stock within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3) of the Code; (y) such holder or beneficial owner is not a controlled foreign corporation related to the Issuer through actual or constructive stock ownership for US federal income tax purposes; and (z) such holder or beneficial owner is not a bank; (ii) such holder or beneficial owner (and any intermediary through which such holder or beneficial owner holds the Additional Notes) qualifies for an exemption from any taxes imposed under the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (which shall, for this purpose, refer to any taxes imposed under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (and any amended or successor version), any current or future regulations or official interpretations thereof, any agreements entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of the Code, or any law or regulation implementing an intergovernmental agreement between a non-US jurisdiction and the United States with respect to the foregoing); and (iii) such holder or beneficial owner is able to provide any required US tax documentation to certify to the foregoing representations or to such holder’s or beneficial owner’s status as a United States person as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code upon reasonable request by the Issuer or an applicable withholding agent.

Obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru payments are published in the Federal Register generally would be “grandfathered” unless materially modified after such date. Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution, FATCA could apply to payments on the Additional Notes only if there is a significant modification of the Additional Notes for US federal income tax purposes after the expiration of this grandfathering period. Under proposed regulations, any withholding on foreign passthru payments on the Additional Notes that are not otherwise grandfathered would apply to passthru payments made on or after the date that is two years after the date of publication in the Federal Register of applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru payments. Taxpayers generally may rely on these proposed regulations until final regulations are issued. No such final regulations defining foreign passthru payments have been issued as of the date hereof.

This discussion is limited to consequences relevant to a US holder (as defined below) except for the discussion of FATCA (as defined under “— Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act”), and does not address the effects of any US federal tax laws other than US federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-US tax laws. This discussion is based upon the US Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations issued thereunder (the “Treasury Regulations”), and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. No rulings from the US Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) have been or are expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Additional Notes or that any such position would not be sustained. This discussion does not address all of the US federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the unearned income Medicare contribution tax, or to holders subject to special rules, such as certain financial institutions, US expatriates, insurance companies, individual retirement accounts, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities, US holders whose functional currency is not the US dollar, tax-exempt entities, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or other pass through entities and investors in such entities, persons liable for alternative minimum tax, US holders that are resident in or have a permanent establishment in a jurisdiction outside the United States, persons holding the Additional Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion transaction” or other integrated transaction, entities covered by the antiinversion rules, and persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the Additional Notes being taken into account in an applicable financial statement. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who purchase the Additional Notes in the Offering hereby at the price indicated on the cover page, and who hold the Additional Notes as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally for investment). For purposes of this discussion, a “US holder” is a beneficial owner of an Additional Note that is, for US federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation or any entity taxable as a corporation for US federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) any estate the income of which is subject to US federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) any trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more US persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a US person. If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for US federal income tax purposes holds the Additional Notes, the US tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A partnership considering an investment in the Additional Notes, and partners in such a partnership, should consult their tax advisors regarding the US federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Additional Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511
364,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,107,CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS,107.1,General Fiduciary Matters,107.1.1,,"ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of an ERISA Plan and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation with respect to the assets of such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan. In considering an investment in the Notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a Plan fiduciary should consult with its counsel in order to determine the suitability of the Notes for such Plan, including whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Laws relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan and the need for, and the availability, if necessary, of any exemptive relief under any such laws or regulations. In addition, a fiduciary of a Plan should consult with its counsel in order to determine if the investment satisfies the fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws. Each ERISA Plan should consider the fact that none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchaser, and the Trustee and their respective affiliates (collectively, the “Transaction Parties”) is undertaking to act, or will undertake to act, as a fiduciary to any ERISA Plan with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. The Transaction Parties are not undertaking to provide investment advice or advice based on any particular investment need, or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. All communications, correspondence and materials from the Transaction Parties with respect to the Notes are intended to be general in nature and are not directed at any specific purchaser of the Notes, and do not constitute advice regarding the advisability of investment in the Notes for any specific purchaser. The decision to purchase and hold the Notes must be made solely by each prospective ERISA Plan purchaser on an arm’s length basis.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511
364,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,107,CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS,107.2,Prohibited Transaction Issues,107.2.1,,"Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is applicable to the transaction. Such “prohibited transactions” include, without limitation, (1) a direct or indirect extension of credit to a party in interest or to a disqualified person, (2) the sale or exchange of any property between an ERISA Plan and a party in interest or a disqualified person, or (3) the transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of, a party in interest or a disqualified person, of any plan assets. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engages in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and ----- liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition, holding and/or disposition of Notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which any Transaction Party is considered a party in interest or disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction rules could be applicable to the purchase and holding of the Notes by an ERISA Plan, depending on the type and circumstances of the fiduciary making the decision to acquire such Notes and the relationship of the party in interest or disqualified person to the ERISA Plan. Included among these exemptions are Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code for certain transactions between an ERISA Plan and non-fiduciary service providers to the ERISA Plan. In addition, the United States Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the Notes. These class exemptions (as may be amended from time to time) include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 (respecting transactions effected by independent “qualified professional asset managers”), PTCE 90-1 (respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts), PTCE 91-38 (respecting bank collective investment funds), PTCE 95-60 (respecting life insurance company general accounts) and PTCE 96-23 (respecting transactions directed by in-house asset managers). Each of these PTCEs contains conditions and limitations on its application. Thus, the fiduciary of an ERISA Plan that is considering acquiring and/or holding the Notes in reliance of any of these, or any other, PTCEs should carefully review the conditions and limitations of the PTCE and consult with their counsel to confirm that it is applicable. There can be no, and the Issuer does not provide any, assurance that any PTCE or any other exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the Notes. Governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and non-US plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws. Fiduciaries of any such plans should consult with their counsel before purchasing the Notes to determine the need for, if necessary, and the availability of, any exemptive relief under any Similar Laws. Because of the foregoing, the Notes (and any interest therein) should not be purchased or held by any person investing the assets of any Plan, unless such acquisition, holding and subsequent disposition will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a violation of any Similar Laws. The foregoing discussion is necessarily general in nature, is not intended to be all-inclusive, and should not be construed as legal advice or a legal opinion. Further, no assurance can be given that future legislation, administrative rulings, court decisions or regulatory action will not modify the conclusions set forth in this discussion. Any such changes may be retroactive and thereby apply to transactions entered into prior to the date of their enactment or release. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries or other persons considering purchasing the Notes (and holding the Notes) on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such transactions and whether an exemption would be applicable.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

Accordingly, the Additional Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this offering memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Additional Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this offering memorandum and resale of the Additional Notes. See “Notice to Investors,” “Notice to Certain EEA Investors and Investors _in the United Kingdom,”“Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors,”“Prohibition of Sales to Retail Investors in the United Kingdom” and “Transfer Restrictions.”_ The Issuer and the Guarantors have also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the US Securities Act or the safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Additional Notes. It is expected that delivery of the Additional Notes will be made against payment therefore on or around the date specified on the cover page of the offering memorandum, which will be the business day following the date of pricing of the Additional Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+ ”).

Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Additional Notes on the date of pricing or the next succeeding business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Additional Notes who wish to trade the Additional Notes on the date of pricing or the next succeeding business days should consult their own advisor. The Additional Notes will constitute a new class of securities with no established trading market. The Initial Purchaser has advised the Issuer that, following the completion of this offering, it currently intends to make a market in the Additional Notes as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. However, the Initial Purchaser is not obligated to do so, and the Initial Purchaser may discontinue any market making activities with respect to the Additional Notes at any time in its sole discretion. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that any market for the Additional Notes will develop, that it will be liquid and that you will be able to sell any of the Additional Notes held by you at a particular time or that the prices that you receive when you sell will be favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Additional Notes and the Guarantees and the _Collateral—There may not be an active trading market for the Additional Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Additional Notes may be limited.” Each purchaser of the Additional Notes, by its purchase of the_ Additional Notes, will be deemed to have made certain acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements as set forth under “Notice to Investors,” “Notice to Certain EEA Investors and Investors in the _United Kingdom,” “Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors” and “Prohibition of Sales to Retail Investors in the United Kingdom.”_ ----- In connection with the offering, Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE (the “Stabilizing Manager”) (or persons acting on its behalf) may purchase and sell Additional Notes in the open market. These transactions may include over allotment, stabilizing transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids. Over allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the Initial Purchaser. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the Additional Notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Additional Notes. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the Additional Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchaser to reclaim a selling concession from a broker/ dealer when the Additional Notes originally sold by such broker/dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. These transactions may be effected in the over the counter market or otherwise. These activities may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the Additional Notes. As a result, the price of the Additional Notes may be higher than the prices that otherwise might exist in the open market. Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchaser makes any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Additional Notes. In addition, there is no obligation on the Stabilizing Manager to engage in such transactions and neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchaser makes any representation that the Stabilizing Manager will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice. Any stabilizing action, if commenced, must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the Additional Notes Issue Date and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Additional Notes.

The Initial Purchaser has received, and expects to receive, customary fees and commissions for the Transactions. In particular, the Initial Purchaser or certain of its are mandated lead arrangers and lenders under the Super Senior Facilities, and such entities have received customary fees for their services in such capacities. The Initial Purchaser or its affiliates have committed to provide bridge loan financing in respect of the Acquisition in the event that the Offering is not consummated and such entities will receive customary fees in respect thereof. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchaser and its affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer, the Guarantors or their respective affiliates. The Initial Purchaser and its affiliates may also receive allocations of the Additional Notes. The Initial Purchaser and its affiliates have and may also, in the future, act as hedge counterparties to the Issuer consistent with their customary risk management policies, including in connection with the Acquisition. Typically, the Initial Purchaser and its affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities, including potentially the Additional Notes. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Additional Notes. The Initial Purchaser and its affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views with respect to such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

364,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,23,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,23.1,Germany,23.1.1,,"The Issuer has been advised by its German counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of civil liabilities based on US federal or state securities laws, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in US federal or state courts. The United States and Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment by any US federal or state court for payment, whether or not predicated solely upon US federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Germany. A final judgment by a US federal or state court, however, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German court generally would not reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a US court, except as noted below. The recognition and enforcement of a US judgment by a German court would be conditional upon a number of factors, including the following: - the judgment being final under US federal or state law; - the US court having had jurisdiction over the original proceeding under German law; - the defendant having had the chance to defend herself or himself against an unduly or untimely served complaint; - the judgment of the US court being consistent with the judgment of a German court or a recognized judgment of a foreign court handed down before the judgment of the US court; - the matter (Verfahren) resulting in the judgment of the US court being consistent with the matter (Verfahren) pending before a German court, provided that such German matter was pending before a German court prior to the US court entered its judgment; - the enforcement of the judgment by the US court being compatible with the fundamental principles of German law, in particular with the civil liberties (Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz); and - generally, the guarantee of reciprocity. Subject to the foregoing, purchasers of securities may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from US federal or state courts in Germany. The Issuer cannot, however, assure you that attempts to enforce judgments in Germany will be successful. In addition, in the past the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages has been denied by German courts as incompatible with the fundamental principles of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a US court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. German civil procedure differs substantially from US civil procedure in a number of respects. With respect to the production of evidence, for example, US federal and state law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pre-trial discovery process exists under German law. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,511
364,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,23,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,23.2,England and Wales,23.2.1,,"The United States and England currently do not have a treaty between them providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon US federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in England. In order to enforce any such US judgment in England, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England. In such an action, the English court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the US court (subject to what is described below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). Recognition and enforcement of a US judgment by an English court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the following: - the US court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English conflicts of laws principles and rules of English private international law; - the US judgment not having been given in breach of a jurisdiction or arbitration clause; - the US judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money; - the US judgment not contravening English public policy or the Human Rights Act 1998; - the US judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in respect of a penalty or fine, or otherwise involving the enforcement of a non-English penal or revenue law; - the US judgment not being contrary to the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980; - the US judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural justice; - there not having been a prior inconsistent decision of an English court in respect of the same matter involving the same parties; and - the English enforcement proceedings being commenced within the relevant limitation period. If an English court gives judgment for the sum payable under a US judgment, the English judgment will be enforceable by methods generally available for this purpose. The judgment creditor is able to utilize any method or methods of enforcement available to him/her at the time. In addition, it may not be possible to obtain an English judgment or to enforce that judgment if the judgment debtor is subject to any insolvency or similar proceedings, if the judgment debtor has any set-off or counter-claim against the judgment creditor or if an appeal is pending or anticipated against the judgment or against the foreign judgment. Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in England judgments in civil and commercial matters that have been obtained from US federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England. In addition, it is questionable whether an English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in England, instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon US federal securities laws. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

364,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,172,INDEX TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,172.28,Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (1)** **General principles,172.28.1,,"In accordance with Regulation 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council, RENK Holding GmbH, Munich, prepared its consolidated financial statements for 2020 in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) endorsed by the European Union. These condensed consolidated interim consolidated financial statements of RENK Holding GmbH as of March 31, 2021 were prepared in accordance with IAS 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” and do not contain all the information and disclosures in the notes that are required for consolidated financial statements as of the end of the fiscal year in accordance with IFRS, but rather should be read in conjunction with the IFRS consolidated financial statements published by the company for fiscal year 2020. The information in the notes presents the material circumstances needed in order to understand the changes in the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the RENK Group that have taken effect since December 31, 2020.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511
364,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,172,INDEX TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,172.29,(2)** **Accounting policies,172.29.1,,"RENK has implemented all accounting standards endorsed by the EU, effective for financial periods since January 1, 2021 and relevant to the RENK Group. The adoption of the new accounting standards did not have a material impact on these financial statements. Unless any changes are explicitly stated, the accounting policies used in the condensed consolidated interim consolidated financial statements are the same as those used in the last consolidated financial statements as of the end of fiscal year 2020. The accounting for the acquisition of the former RENK Group has not yet been completed. No adjustments have been made to the accounting for the business combination as of March 31, 2021. The provisional nature of the accounting for the business combination continues to relate to the determination of the identifiable net assets and the goodwill. On the basis of these preliminary values, it is not possible to make a sufficiently precise allocation to the cash-generating units, which is mandatory for performing an impairment test. Furthermore, there were no indications of impairment at the reporting date. A detailed description of these methods can be found in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020. All amounts have been rounded in line with commercial practice; this can result in minor deviations in the addition of figures. A discount rate of 0.90% was used to calculate pension provisions in Germany in these interim financial statements. As of December 31, 2020, the discount rate was 0.40%. The increase in the interest rate is the main reason for the actuarial gains of € 10,639 thousand. As a result of the partial tax exemption of the pension assets in Germany, the deferred tax attributable to this amounts to only € 2,390 thousand. The pension provisions reported as of March 31, 2021 comprise the net amount of the pension obligation of € 187,939 thousand and the plan assets of € 182,793 thousand. The income tax expense in these consolidated interim consolidated financial statements is calculated on the basis of the effective income tax rate anticipated for the year as a whole. In the opinion of the management, these condensed consolidated interim consolidated financial statements contain all the normal adjustments required for an appropriate presentation of the net assets, financial position and results of operations. The results for the first three months of fiscal year 2021 do not necessarily provide any indication of future business performance. The management must make assumptions and estimates in preparing the condensed consolidated interim consolidated financial statements. These affect the amounts and reporting of the figures stated for assets, liabilities, income and expenses for the reporting period. The actual amounts incurred can differ from these estimates.

The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close in the second half of 2021. To finance the purchase price, the existing bond is to be increased by around € 200 million. If the deal is closed before the bond is increased, the financing would be provided by interim financing secured in the quarter. The costs of obtaining the financing in the amount of € 4,600 thousand are recognized in interest expense. CPS is an established manufacturer of transmissions and engines for armored tracked vehicles on the American and international market. MM operates in the development and construction of high-performance electric power supply and hybrid drive systems for military applications. On completion of the acquisition, RENK will become one of the world’s leading suppliers of mobility solutions for armored vehicles with a focus on the US and Europe. The company will bundle the state-of-the-art technologies of RENK, the acquired Horstman Group and CPS and MM. After signing the contract, RENK founded two new US companies as vehicles for the purpose of carrying out the takeover of CPS. RENK Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of RENK GmbH, and Combat Mobility Solutions LLC (CMS), a wholly owned subsidiary of RENK Holdings, Inc., were founded on March 5, 2021. CMS will acquire the assets of CPS on completion of the deal. Thanks to its business model, as in the 2020 fiscal year, the COVID-19 pandemic has had an only limited impact on RENK’s net assets, financial position and results of operations in the first three months. Overall, there are no indications of possible impairment losses on intangible assets, including goodwill in particular, or property, plant and equipment.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

Their carrying amounts as of the end of the reporting period therefore approximately match their fair value. The future cash flows for derivative financial instruments without option components, such as currency forwards, are calculated using forward curves. The fair value of these instruments is the total of the discounted cash flows. The options on currency pairs are measured on the basis of standard option pricing models (BlackScholes model). Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income include equity shares of € 2,975 thousand for which the RENK Group exercises the option for measurement at fair value through other comprehensive income. In the context of recognition through other comprehensive income, the changes in fair value are recognized in equity after taking deferred taxes into account. A change in the significant, unobservable inputs has no significant effect on equity or profit after tax, either in isolation or combination. The fair value measurement of the equity instruments in Level 3 is based in particular on the respective corporate planning and the company-specific discount rates.

The asset comprises contractually agreed goods and services. At contract inception it is determined whether the performance obligation is satisfied over time. If the requirements for this are not met, the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time in line with agreed trade terms (“Incoterms”). Performance obligations are recognized over time in the following cases: - The services rendered that benefit the customer are consumed by the customer at the same time that the services are rendered. - The assets created or processed are controlled by the customer during performance by the entity. - The assets created have no alternative use for the entity and the entity has an enforceable right to payment by the customer for the performance completed to date. Sales revenue from performance obligations fulfilled over time is accounted for using the percentage of completion method. RENK calculates the percentage of completion using the input method to estimate the costs incurred relative to the total expected costs. The contract costs incurred are the best measure of the satisfaction of performance obligations. If the expected costs exceed the expected sales revenue, the expected loss is immediately recognized in full as an expense by writing down capitalized assets and recognizing provisions if necessary. Sales revenue is determined by the transaction price, which is equal to the expected consideration including possible variable remuneration components. If variable consideration has been agreed in a contract, sales revenue is estimated using the most likely amount method. Variable consideration is only taken into account in the transaction price if it is highly probable that it will arise.

In addition to the direct material and manufacturing costs, production costs also comprise production-related overheads, including depreciation of production equipment. Warranty provisions are recognized when the products are sold. Expenses for research are immediately recognized in profit or loss. Interest and other borrowing costs are recognized as expenses in the period in which they arise, with the exception of borrowing costs that are capitalized as part of the cost of qualifying assets. A qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily takes a period of at least a year to get ready for its intended use or sale. A weighted average cost of capital before taxes (WACC) that reflects the market conditions is used as the discount rate. The discount rate is calculated on the basis of the interest rate for risk-free investments, a market risk premium and the borrowing rate and takes into account the specific peer group information for the beta factors and the debt-to-equity ratio. The underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and adjusted as necessary. If a recoverable amount cannot be determined for an individual asset, the recoverable amount of the smallest identifiable cash-generating unit to which the asset in question can be assigned is determined. If the recoverable amount of an asset is lower than its carrying amount, an impairment loss on the asset is immediately recognized in profit or loss. If an asset or cash-generating unit on which an impairment loss was recognized later has a higher recoverable amount, an impairment loss is reversed up to no higher than the amortized cost that would have resulted without the impairment. The impairment loss is reversed in profit or loss and is recognized in other operating income. The reversal of impairment losses on goodwill is not permitted. The impairment tests at RENK are based on planning adjusted for the COVID-19-pandemic. For fiscal year 2020, impairment of € 690 thousand was taken on the carrying amount of investments in a non-consolidated subsidiary. Please see “(i) Primary financial instruments” for information on impairment in connection with financial assets. To calculate loss allowances, insignificant receivables and significant individual receivables without evidence of impairment are grouped into homogeneous portfolios based on common credit risk characteristics and broken down by risk class. Average historical probabilities of default in conjunction with the future parameters of the respective portfolio are used to calculate the amount of impairment. Impairment for expected credit losses is calculated using a general approach based on the allocation of financial assets to the following stages: asset is sold is not permitted, and instead reclassification is to retained earnings on disposal of the equity investment. Any dividends are recognized in profit or loss unless they represent a repayment of the cost. With the exception of derivative financial instruments, financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost. Financial assets and liabilities are reported at their gross value. They are only offset when this is legally enforceable for RENK at the current time and it actually intends to offset them. Central finance management across the RENK Group is performed by RENK AG. Cash for the RENK Group operating units is essentially managed centrally by RENK AG as part of cash pooling. Here the account balances of RENK AG and its consolidated subsidiaries are generally combined on a daily basis. In this way, RENK AG manages and guarantees the RENK Group’s liquidity and credit supply. period and discounted to present value. Their measurement reflects assumptions about the future development of certain parameters that affect the future level of benefits. Provisions for pension obligations are reduced by the fair value of the plan assets held to cover the pension obligations. If plan assets exceed obligations, the excess is only recognized in other assets if it will result in a refund from the plan or a reduction of future contributions. The service cost, which represents the benefits of active employees accumulated in accordance with the benefit plan in the fiscal year, is reported in functional expenses. Net interest income and expenses are calculated by multiplying the net asset or net liability by the discount rate and are included in interest expense. Remeasurements of the net asset or net liability include actuarial gains and losses arising from differences between the actuarial assumptions used and the actual trends, changes in actuarial assumptions and the return on plan assets, not including amounts included in net interest income or expenses. Remeasurements are recognized net of deferred taxes in equity. Payments for defined contribution plans are recognized in functional expenses. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed as part of the business combination are initially measured at fair value at the acquisition date. Costs related to acquisitions are recognized as an expense. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable net asset acquired is recognized as goodwill. other things, assumptions about the interpretation of complex tax regulations and the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the respective tax type and jurisdiction. If these assumptions differ from the actual outcome of such tax uncertainties, this can affect tax expenses and deferred taxes. The best estimate of the expected tax payment is used for recognized uncertain income tax positions. Depending on the matter at hand, the measurement of other provisions and similar obligations is complex at times and entails estimates to a considerable extent. The assumptions made by management with respect to the timing and amount of utilization are based, among other things, on historical data, available technical data, estimates of cost trends and potential warranty claims, discount rates and possible recoverable amounts. Litigation and other legal proceedings simultaneously give rise to complex legal issues and are subject to many difficulties and uncertainties. A provision is recognized for this if it is likely that, in connection with these proceedings, a liability has been incurred that will probably lead to an outflow of resources and its amount can be reliably estimated. Assessing whether a present obligation as of the end of the reporting period is as a result of a past event, whether a future outflow is likely and whether the obligation can be estimated reliably requires considerable judgment and significant estimates by management. Future events and developments as well as changes in estimates and assumptions can lead to an amended assessment at a future date. Additional expenses that can have a material effect on the net assets, financial position and results of operations of RENK thus cannot be completely ruled out. Changes in contractual or actual circumstances are monitored and assessed as regards the potential impact on the amount and reporting of the recognized assets and liabilities, income and expenses and information on contingent assets and liabilities in the reporting period. Developments in these general conditions that deviate from assumptions and are beyond management control can cause amounts to differ from the original estimates. With the approval of the extraordinary stockholders’ meeting for the squeeze-out under merger law and the filing of the merger in the commercial register on December 22, 2020, the conditions are met for accounting the merger of the former RENK AG, Augsburg, and the former Rebecca BidCo AG, Munich, and the squeezeout. As a result, as of this date, a financial liability to the minority stockholders in the amount stipulated in the squeeze-out opinion is recognized instead of the minority interest. The merger of former RENK AG into former Rebecca BidCo AG triggers real estate transfer tax for RENK AG’s real property. Due to the registration in the commercial register in 2020, the merger is unstoppable and thus the real estate transfer tax has to be expensed in the reporting year. The amount currently recognized represents the best estimate as of the reporting date. The financial liability recognized may still change as a result of the court proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

This goodwill was assigned to the cash-generating units to test it for impairment. It is assigned to the place expected to benefit from the business combination from which the goodwill arose. In the fiscal year 2020, the goodwill was not tested for impairment as it is only based on a preliminary purchase price allocation. On the basis of these preliminary values, it is not possible to make a sufficiently precise allocation to the cash-generating units, which is mandatory for carrying out an impairment test. Beyond this, there were no indications of impairment as of the reporting date. Expenses for the development of new products or series are capitalized when the new products or series are technically and economically feasible, are scheduled for internal use or for sale, the expenses can be measured reliably and sufficient resources to complete the development project are available.

The lease liability is recognized at the amount of the future lease payments discounted at the incremental borrowing rate over the entire term of the lease. During the term of the lease, the lease liability is carried forward using the effective interest method and taking lease payments into account. The right-of-use asset is recognized at the amount of the lease liability plus initial direct costs. In subsequent periods, the right-of-use asset is to be amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease or the economic life, when this is shorter. The right-of-use assets reported in the balance sheet are shown in the positions where the lease related assets would have been shown if the RENK Group had owned them. The right-of-use assets are therefore reported under non-current assets in property, plant and equipment as of the end of the reporting period. The practical expedients applied for short-term and low-value leases mean that no right-of-use asset or lease liability is recognized for these leases. The lease payments for these are recognized in the income statement as an expense. Low-value leases are leases where the new value of the leased asset does not exceed € 5,000. Leases with a total term of up to 12 months are classed as short-term. The IFRS 16 accounting requirements are not applied to leases for intangible assets. Many leases include extension and termination options. All relevant factors and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise or not exercise the option are taken into account when determining the lease terms. Optional periods are taken into account when determining the lease term if it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised or not exercised. To discount the lease liability, an incremental borrowing rate of the RENK Group is used in line with the currency area and the contract term. In the reporting period, the lease liabilities from new leases, contract modifications and changes in determining the term of the lease were discounted at a Group interest rate in a range between 3.13 % and 3.84 %. Lessors distinguish between finance and operating leases on the basis of the distribution of the risks and opportunities from the asset.

Unconditional rights to consideration must also be taken into account. In the RENK Group, contract assets result from the satisfaction over time of performance obligations accounted for deploying input-based methods on the basis of costs incurred. Under this method, pro rata sales revenue and the cost of sales are reported in accordance with the progress achieved by the end of the reporting period. This is calculated based on the transaction price agreed with the customer and the expected contract costs. The percentage of completion is calculated as the proportion of the costs incurred by the end of the reporting period in the total forecast contract. If the result of a performance obligation cannot be reliably determined, sales revenue is recognized only in the amount of the contract costs incurred. In the balance sheet, the revenues recognized under the percentage of completion method are shown in the contractual assets net of the prepayments received and the prepayments receivable. Expected losses from performance of obligations over a period of time are recognized in full. In contractual assets, contract losses are recognized on a pro rata basis and provisions are formed for the remaining share of the expected contract losses.

364,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,172,INDEX TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,172.112,Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (3)** **Accounting principles (Continued) (i)** **Primary financial instruments,172.112.1,,"Financial instruments are agreements that give rise to a financial asset at one entity while at the same time giving rise to a financial liability or equity instrument at another. Regular way purchases and sales of financial instruments are recognized at the settlement date, i.e. the date on which the asset is delivered. Primary financial instruments include, in particular, trade receivables, financial investments, securities, cash and cash equivalents, financial liabilities, trade payables and other financial liabilities. Primary financial instruments are carried at fair value less or plus transaction costs on initial recognition. This excludes financial instruments recognized at fair value through profit or loss and trade receivables that do not have significant financing components, which are recognized at transaction price in accordance with IFRS 15. Fair value on initial measurement is generally the transaction price, i.e. the consideration given or received. On initial recognition, financial assets are classified as follows based on the business model applied and the structure of cash flows: - at amortized cost; - at fair value through other comprehensive income (debt instruments); - at fair value through other comprehensive income (equity instruments); - at fair value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities are assigned to the following categories: - at amortized cost; - at fair value through profit or loss. Subsidiaries that are not consolidated for reasons of materiality and financial instruments from rights and obligations under IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” are not assigned to a measurement category under IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”, though the impairment provisions of IFRS 9 must be taken into account for the latter financial assets on account of an exemption. Regarding financial assets (debt instruments) for which the cash flows at specified dates are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI criterion), RENK exclusively intends to hold these to collect the associated cash flows. These financial assets are thus measured at amortized cost. The amortized cost of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount: - at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured on initial recognition; - less any repayments; - less any recognized loss allowances, write-downs for impairment on or the uncollectibility of financial assets; and - plus or minus the cumulative amortization of any difference between the original amount and the amount repayable on maturity (premium, discount) using the effective interest method. In the RENK Group, the “Financial assets at amortized cost” category mainly comprises trade receivables, other financial assets and cash and cash equivalents. Non-interest bearing and low-interest-bearing receivables with a remaining term of more than twelve months are discounted by discounting the future cash flows at the market rate. The credit risk of financial assets at amortized cost and contract assets under contracts with customers is taken into account by the recognition of Group-wide loss allowances for expected credit losses (expected credit loss model) and by recognizing impairment for the losses already incurred. A potential impairment is assumed not just if certain circumstances apply—such as late payments over a certain period, the initiation of enforcement measures, imminent insolvency or over-indebtedness, application for insolvency proceedings or failure of restructuring measures—but also for receivables not past due. In addition to the above objective indications, the length of time payments are past due is also taken into account in assessing increases in credit risk. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

Loss allowances on trade receivables and contract assets are recognized in accordance with the simplified approach of IFRS 9. Under this method, the expected credit losses over the total remaining term of receivables and contract assets are calculated on the basis of a provision matrix with rates graded depending on the number of days that a receivable is past due. These rates are based on historical loss rates and forward-looking factors.

364,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,172,INDEX TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,172.127,(p)** **Estimates and judgments,172.127.1,,"When preparing consolidated financial statements, to a certain extent assumptions and estimates are made that affect the amount and reporting of the recognized assets and liabilities, income and expenses and information on contingent assets and liabilities in the reporting period. The estimates were made on the basis of past experience and other relevant factors, including the assumption of going concern. All estimates and assumptions are made to the best of knowledge and belief to provide a true and fair view of the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the Group. Any uncertainty is adequately reflected in valuations, although future events can still differ from these estimates and have a material effect on the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the RENK Group. Estimates and judgments are reviewed on an ongoing basis. The assumptions made regarding the following matters as of the end of the reporting period are of particular significance: Estimates of the useful life of depreciable assets are based on past experience. If, in the context of the review of useful life, a change is made in estimates, the remaining useful life is adjusted and any impairment loss is recognized. Recognizing the leases in the form of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability requires estimates on the lease term of the relevant lease components. It must be assessed whether it is reasonably certain that the contractually agreed extension, termination and call options will be exercised. The estimate for the initial recognition of the lease components determines the amount of the lease liability and thus the right-of-use asset. Changes to the estimate in subsequent periods result in a change to the residual values of statement of financial position items related to leases. Individual performance obligations are accounted for over time using the percentage of completion method. Sales revenue is accounted for using the percentage of completion method. This method places considerable importance on accurate estimates of the percentage of completion. Depending on which method is used to determine the percentage of completion, significant estimates include contract revenue, total contract costs, the remaining costs to completion, contract risks and other assessments. The management of the operating units is continuously reviewing the estimates for such performance obligations and adjusts them as necessary. Estimates, especially for variable remuneration components, are required to calculate the transaction price as the expected consideration in exchange for the transfer of goods and services. The variability relates to the claim actually arising and to the amount of the claim. The single most likely amount in a range of possible contractual consideration amounts is selected as the most likely amount. In addition, some or all of the variable consideration component is only included in the transaction price to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal of the revenue recognized will not occur. This assessment of probabilities and the restriction of variable remuneration components is based on management estimates. Determining impairment of financial assets requires estimates of the level and probability of occurrence of future events. As far as possible, estimates are derived from past experience. Pensions and similar obligations are measured using actuarial methods. These are mainly based on assumptions relating to discount rates, salary and pension trends and mortality. These actuarial assumptions can differ significantly from actual developments due to changes in market and economic conditions and therefore lead to a substantial change in pensions and similar obligations. The underlying assumptions are presented in the “Pensions and similar obligations” section. As the Group operates in several countries, it is subject to different tax laws.

When actively working, employees accrue pension capital from employer- and employee-financed contributions and returns from investment on the capital market.

These commitments entail the usual longevity and inflation risks, which are regularly monitored and evaluated.

The proper management and use of trust assets is monitored by independent trustees. WTW Pensionsfonds AG is also subject to the supervision of the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin).

The BVG 2015 GT mortality tables were used for Switzerland. Discount rates are based on the yields on corporate bonds with high credit ratings, with a maturity and currency matching the respective obligations. Pension and pay trends either correspond to contractual adjustments or are based on those found in the general regulations applicable.

A change in the significant, unobservable inputs has no significant effect on equity or profit after tax, either in isolation or combination. Total dividends of € 605 thousand were received in the reporting period. For derivative financial instruments without option components, in particular currency forwards, future cash flows are calculated by discounting the forward cash flows on the basis of the FX spot and swap rates (calculation using the interest difference method). The fair value of these instruments is the total of the discounted cash flows. The options on currency pairs are measured on the basis of standard option pricing models, i.e. generalized Black-Scholes formulas. Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are level 2 of the fair value hierarchy with the exception of other equity investments, which are level 3. With the exception of cash and cash equivalents and the interests, which are allocated to level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, all other financial assets and liabilities at amortized cost are allocated to level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

Hedging is carried out with due regard for banks’ risk management requirements and is subject to stringent monitoring, which is guaranteed in particular by a strict separation of functions on the basis of the dual control principle. Liquidity management and investment in the RENK Group is centralized under group-wide cash management.

Currencies with a high correlation to the euro, such as the Danish krone, and equity investments or equity-type loans in foreign currencies, if at all relevant, are only hedged in individual cases. In addition, there is hedging for planned sales revenue in foreign currency from series production business within defined hedging ranges and, occasionally, for customer projects whose materialization is highly probable. The RENK management is regularly informed of the currency positions of the RENK Group. As of the end of the reporting period, RENK’s foreign exchange exposure is primarily from transactions in USD, CHF, JPY, CNY and GBP. Thanks to the currency forwards and options in place for these currencies, RENK was not exposed to any significant risks. In a sensitivity analysis, the primary and derivative financial instruments in place at the end of the reporting period were measured in a hypothetical scenario. The effects of a 10 % appreciation/depreciation of a currency per currency pair as of December 31, 2020 are as follows: Allowances on trade receivables and contract assets are calculated using a provision matrix with provision rates graded according to the aging analysis of receivables. Specific valuation allowances are recognized if there is objective evidence of credit losses or other contractual anomalies. Other financial receivables and cash and cash equivalents are checked for cash shortfalls using a general three-stage approach. There were no significant clusters in terms of credit risk in the RENK Group in the past fiscal year. The credit risks of the financial assets can be grouped into the following risk classes: In addition, in the framework of a syndicated loan agreement, the RENK Group has a guarantee credit line of € 175,000 thousand, € 120,889 thousand of which was utilized. Outside the syndicated loan agreement, there are additional guarantee credit lines on a bilateral basis of € 23,988 thousand, € 21,981 thousand of which were utilized on the reporting date. Cash collateral of € 11,257 thousand was provided for the bilateral guarantee credit lines as of the reporting date. To partially finance the acquisition of the shares in the former RENK AG, Rebecca BidCo AG issued a € 320 million bond on the regulated market of TISE in Guernsey in the current fiscal year with a term of five years and with an interest coupon of 5.75 % p.a.. In addition, a long-term loan of € 80 million with a term of more than five years and two short-term loans totaling € 96 million were taken out from Rebecca BidCo SARL. The interest rates for the loans range between 0 % and 6 %. Cash and cash equivalents are essentially used to finance working capital and short-term obligations. Management is informed regularly about cash inflows and outflows. The cash flows at RENK are dominated by the maturities arising from business operations. These are predominantly of a short-term nature. Cash clearing takes place through the inclusion in the central financial management of RENK AG.

The maximum credit risk is reflected by the carrying amounts of financial assets reported in the statement of financial position. Credit risks are minimized, and risk provisions calculated, mainly with the following measures: Sovereign and counterparty risks arising from business operations are continuously assessed locally. Security levels and forms are determined based on this. Outstanding debts are also continuously monitored locally. If default risks arise, allowances are recognized. Credit risk is limited by various, sometimes country-specific, forms of security. Letters of credit, guarantees, warranties, retention of title and customer prepayments could be used. In project business, the risk of default is minimized by prepayments and by obtaining collateral.

Solvency and the provision of liquidity in the RENK Group are assured at all times on the basis of rolling liquidity planning of the RENK companies. To limit the liquidity risk, inflows and outflows of cash and maturities are monitored and managed at all times. Financing requirements are covered by both operating cash flow and external financing. There were therefore no significant risk clusters in the past fiscal year. Cash for the operating units is essentially managed centrally as part of cash pooling. Cash and cash equivalents of the RENK companies are combined on a daily basis. Thus, liquidity surpluses and requirements can be managed as necessary. For external financing, the opportunities on the financial markets are tracked continuously to ensure financial flexibility and to limit refinancing risks. In certain countries (such as Brazil and China), the Group can only dispose over local cash and cash equivalents internationally in compliance with the applicable foreign exchange restrictions. Other than this there are no significant restrictions.

In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so. Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511
364,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,103,INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT,103.4,Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report,103.4.1,,"Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Sec. 317 HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report. We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of these systems. - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures. - Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern. - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements that comply with IFRSs as adopted in the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Sec. 315e (1) HGB give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group. ----- - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions. - Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with [German] law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides. - Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

These condensed interim consolidated financial statements of RENK AG as of March 31, 2020 were prepared in accordance with IAS 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” and do not contain all the information and disclosures in the notes that are required for consolidated financial statements as of the end of the fiscal year in accordance with IFRS, but rather should be read in conjunction with the IFRS consolidated financial statements published by the company for fiscal year 2019. The information in the notes presents the material circumstances needed in order to understand the changes in the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the RENK Group that have taken effect since December 31, 2019. The interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in euro, the functional currency of the RENK Group.

Unless any changes are explicitly stated, the accounting policies used in the condensed interim consolidated financial statements are the same as those used in the last consolidated financial statements as of the end of fiscal year 2019. A detailed description of these methods can be found in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2019. A discount rate of 1.60% was used to calculate pension provisions in these interim financial statements. The income tax expense in these interim consolidated financial statements is calculated on the basis of the effective income tax rate anticipated for the year as a whole. In the opinion of the Executive Board, these condensed interim consolidated financial statements contain all the normal adjustments required for an appropriate presentation of the net assets, financial position and results of operations. The results for the first three months of fiscal year 2020 do not necessarily provide any indication of future business performance. The Executive Board must make assumptions and estimates in preparing the condensed interim consolidated financial statements. These affect the amounts and reporting of the figures stated for assets, liabilities, income and expenses for the reporting period. The actual amounts incurred can differ from these estimates. In addition to the figures, the condensed interim consolidated financial statements also include notes on selected items.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

In this context, RENK’s inclusion in the central cash pooling of the MAN Group was ended and hedges entered into for RENK were transferred to RENK AG. Due to RENKs business model the COVID-19 pandemic has so far had only a minor effect of RENK’s financial position and results of operations in the first quarter. Intangible assets, in particular goodwill, and property, plant and equipment were tested for possible impairment as of March 31, 2020. As RENK currently assumes that the pandemic will be a temporary phenomenon that will not have a lasting negative impact on the Group’s long-term business performance, various scenarios have been developed for 2020 in a departure from the last approved planning. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) was also adjusted as of March 31, 2020. Overall, testing did not give rise to any impairment loss on assets.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

(3) Corresponds to the measurement category “Financial instruments measured at amortized cost” under IFRS 9. Cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, other financial assets, financial liabilities, trade payables and miscellaneous financial liabilities predominantly have a short remaining term. Their carrying amounts as of the end of the reporting period therefore approximately match their fair value. The future cash flows for derivative financial instruments without option components, such as currency forwards, are calculated using forward curves. The fair value of these instruments is the total of the discounted cash flows. The options on currency pairs are measured on the basis of standard option pricing models (BlackScholes model). Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income include equity shares of € 2,975 thousand for which the RENK Group exercises the option for measurement at fair value through other comprehensive income. In the context of recognition through other comprehensive income, the changes in fair value are recognized in equity after taking deferred taxes into account. A change in the significant, unobserva-ble inputs has no significant effect on equity or profit after tax, either in isolation or combination. Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are level 2 of the fair value hierarchy with the exception of the other equity investment, which is level 3.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

The consolidated income statement has been prepared using the cost of sales method. With the exception of certain items such as financial instruments at fair value and provisions for pensions and similar obligations, the consolidated financial statements are prepared on the basis of cost. The consolidated financial statements are based on the financial statements of RENK AG and its consolidated subsidiaries, which are prepared using the same Group-wide accounting policies as the Volkswagen Group. The accounting principles describe the regulations and methods applied in fiscal year 2019, taking into account the first-time adoption of IFRS 16 “Leases”. These new regulations entail some considerable differences in accounting methods and changes in presentation and reporting compared to the previous year. The accounting requirements were implemented using the modified retrospective transition method, whereby the amounts in the opening statement of financial position were adjusted in other comprehensive income. Previous year figures were not adjusted.

The asset comprises contractually agreed goods and services. At contract inception it is determined whether the performance obligation is satisfied over time. If the requirements for this are not met, the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time. Assurance-type warranties must be taken into account in performance obligations. Performance obligations are recognized over time in the following cases: - The services rendered that benefit the customer are consumed by the customer at the same time that the services are rendered. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,511
364,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,103,INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT,103.113,Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (3) Accounting principles (Continued),103.113.1,,"- The assets created or processed are controlled by the customer during performance by the entity. - The assets created have no alternative use for the entity and the entity has an enforceable right to payment by the customer for the performance completed to date. Sales revenue from performance obligations fulfilled over time is accounted for using the percentage of completion method. RENK calculates the percentage of completion using the input method to estimate the costs incurred relative to the total expected costs. The contract costs incurred are the best measure of the satisfaction of performance obligations. If the expected costs exceed the expected sales revenue, the expected loss is immediately recognized in full as an expense by writing down capitalized assets and recognizing provisions if necessary. The amount of sales revenue is determined by the transaction price, which is equal to the expected consideration including possible variable remuneration components. If variable consideration has been agreed in a contract, sales revenue is estimated using the most likely amount method. Variable consideration is only taken into account in the transaction price if it is highly probable that it will arise. For multi-component contracts, the total transaction price is allocated to the individual, distinct performance obligations relative to the stand-alone selling prices. Costs of obtaining or fulfilling a contract are not capitalized as the necessary requirements are not met. In the RENK Group, contract assets result from the satisfaction over time of performance obligations accounted for using the percentage of completion method. Under this method, pro rata sales revenue and the cost of sales are reported in accordance with the progress achieved by the end of the reporting period. This is calculated based on the transaction price agreed with the customer and the expected contract costs. The percentage of completion is calculated as the proportion of the costs incurred by the end of the reporting period in the total forecast contract costs (cost to cost method). If the result of a performance obligation cannot be reliably determined, sales revenue is only recognized in the amount of the contract costs incurred (zero profit method). Under the percentage of completion method, the parts of the contract for which sales revenue has been received are recognized net of prepayments received under prepayments received in the statement of financial position. Expected losses from performance of obligations over a period of time are immediately recognized in full as an expense by writing down capitalized assets and recognizing provisions. Contract liabilities comprise prepayments received and the contra entry for unconditional customer prepayment receivables, i.e. liabilities from prepayments to be received. - less any repayments; - less any recognized loss allowances, write-downs for impairment on or the uncollectibility of financial assets; and - plus or minus the cumulative amortization of any difference between the original amount and the amount repayable on maturity (premium, discount) using the effective interest method. In the RENK Group, the “Financial assets at amortized cost” category mainly comprises trade receivables, other financial assets and cash and cash equivalents. Non-interest-bearing and low-interest-bearing receivables with a remaining term of more than twelve months are discounted by discounting the future cash flows at the market rate, though there were no such receivables as of the end of the reporting periods December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. RENK has no financial assets held under a business model that intends both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets. The credit risk of financial assets at amortized cost and contract assets under contracts with customers is taken into account by the recognition of Group-wide loss allowances for expected credit losses (expected credit loss model) and by recognizing impairment for the losses already incurred. A potential impairment is assumed not just if certain circumstances apply—such as late payments over a certain period, the initiation of enforcement measures, imminent insolvency or over-indebtedness, application for insolvency proceedings or failure of restructuring measures—but also for receivables not past due. In addition to the above objective indications, the length of time payments are past due is also taken into account in assessing increases in credit risk. To calculate loss allowances, insignificant receivables and significant individual receivables without evidence of impairment are grouped into homogeneous portfolios based on common credit risk characteristics and broken down by risk class. Average historical probabilities of default in conjunction with the future parameters of the respective portfolio are used to calculate the amount of impairment. Impairment for expected credit losses is calculated using a general approach based on the allocation of financial assets to the following stages: and contract assets are calculated on the basis of a provision matrix with rates graded depending on the number of days that a receivable is past due. These rates are based on historical loss rates and forward-looking factors. If there is objective evidence of individual impairment, the provision matrix is disregarded and a specific valuation allowance is recognized on trade receivables in the amount of the losses already incurred in line with stage 3 of the general approach. Bad debt allowances on receivables are usually recognized in a separate allowance account. They are derecognized at the same time as the corresponding impaired receivable. Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income include financial investments (equity instruments) for which the RENK Group exercises the irrevocable option for measurement at fair value through other comprehensive income. In the context of recognition through other comprehensive income, the changes in fair value after taking deferred taxes into account and all foreign exchange components are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. Reclassification to profit or loss when the financial asset is sold is not permitted, and instead reclassification is to retained earnings on disposal of the equity investment. Any dividends are recognized in profit or loss unless they represent a repayment of the cost. With the exception of derivative financial instruments, financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost. Financial assets and liabilities are reported at their gross value. They are only offset when this is legally enforceable for RENK at the current time and it actually intends to offset them. RENK used the central financial management of the MAN Group in the year under review. Under a cash pooling process, the balances of the RENK accounts included are closed out by MAN SE, Munich, (hereinafter MAN SE), usually daily, and thus transformed into receivables from/liabilities to MAN SE. As part of its central financial management, MAN SE manages and guarantees the RENK Group’s liquidity and credit supply with corresponding transactions on the international financial markets. Given their cash-like nature, RENK reports the receivables from financial transactions with MAN SE as cash and cash equivalents. They essentially result from central cash pooling and from highly liquid investments of a temporary nature at MAN SE. By contrast, deposits made with MAN SE of an investment nature are reported as other assets. Analogously, liabilities resulting from the central financial management of the MAN Group are reported as financial liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis, for temporary differences in profit or loss arising on consolidation and for tax credits and tax loss carryforwards. Deferred taxes are measured at the prevailing tax rate at the end of the reporting period or the future tax rate highly likely to be used. Deferred tax assets are only recognized to the extent that taxable profit will be available for the utilization of the deductible temporary differences. Valuation allowances are recognized for deferred tax assets whose realization is not expected in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets for tax loss carryforwards are usually subsequently measured based on future taxable income for a planning period of five fiscal years. Deferred tax assets are offset against deferred tax liabilities if they relate to the same taxation authority and to the extent that their maturities match. Changes in deferred taxes in the statement of financial position lead to deferred tax expense or income. If the change in deferred taxes results from items recognized directly in equity, the change in deferred taxes is also recognized directly in equity. for anticipated losses from onerous contracts are recognized when the expected benefit resulting from the contract is less than the unavoidable costs to fulfill the contract. Estimates, especially for variable remuneration components, are required to calculate the transaction price as the expected consideration in exchange for the transfer of goods and services. The variability relates to the claim actually arising and to the amount of the claim. The single most likely amount in a range of possible contractual consideration amounts is selected as the most likely amount. In addition, some or all of the variable consideration component is only included in the transaction price to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal of the revenue recognized will not occur. This assessment of probabilities and the restriction of variable remuneration components is based on management estimates. Determining impairment of financial assets requires estimates of the level and probability of occurrence of future events. As far as possible, estimates are derived from past experience. Pensions and similar obligations are measured using actuarial methods. These are mainly based on assumptions relating to discount rates, salary and pension trends and mortality. These actuarial assumptions can differ significantly from actual developments due to changes in market and economic conditions and therefore lead to a substantial change in pensions and similar obligations. The underlying assumptions are presented in the “Pensions and similar obligations” section. As the Group operates in several countries, it is subject to different tax laws. The expected current income taxes and the deferred tax assets and liabilities must be calculated for each taxable entity. This requires, among other things, assumptions about the interpretation of complex tax regulations and the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the respective tax type and jurisdiction. If these assumptions differ from the actual outcome of such tax uncertainties, this can affect tax expenses and deferred taxes. The best estimate of the expected tax payment is used for recognized uncertain income tax positions. Depending on the matter at hand, the measurement of other provisions and similar obligations is complex at times and entails estimates to a considerable extent. The assumptions made by management with respect to the timing and amount of utilization are based, among other things, on historical data, available technical data, estimates of cost trends and potential warranty claims, discount rates and possible recoverable amounts. Litigation and other legal proceedings simultaneously give rise to complex legal issues and are subject to many difficulties and uncertainties. A provision is recognized for this if it is likely that, in connection with these proceedings, a liability has been incurred that will probably lead to an outflow of resources and its amount can be reliably estimated. Assessing whether a present obligation as of the end of the reporting period is as a result of a past event, whether a future outflow is likely and whether the obligation can be estimated reliably requires considerable judgment and significant estimates by management. Future events and developments as well as changes in estimates and assumptions can lead to an amended assessment at a future date. Additional expenses that can have a material effect on the net assets, financial position and results of operations of RENK thus cannot be completely ruled out. Changes in contractual or actual circumstances are monitored and assessed as regards the potential impact on the amount and reporting of the recognized assets and liabilities, income and expenses and information on contingent assets and liabilities in the reporting period. Developments in these general conditions that deviate from assumptions and are beyond management control can cause amounts to differ from the original estimates.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are measured at fair value at the acquisition date. If the intangible assets have a finite useful life they are amortized on a straight-line basis over their period of use. The amortization period for software is predominantly three years. Licenses and similar rights are amortized over their contractual terms of use. The customer relations acquired as part of the Horstman acquisition are amortized over a period of between 15 and 30 years, with technology amortized over 10 to 30 years and the brand over 30 years. There is no amortization if the useful life cannot be determined. Instead, the intangible assets are tested for impairment at least once a year and impairment losses are recognized if necessary. The acquisition of the Horstman Group resulted in goodwill to be capitalized (previous year: no goodwill). This goodwill was assigned to the cash-generating units to test it for impairment. It is assigned to the place expected to benefit from the business combination from which the goodwill arose. There were no other reportable intangible assets without a finite useful life in the current fiscal year or in the previous year. Expenses for the development of new products or series are capitalized when the new products or series are technically and economically feasible, are scheduled for internal use or for sale, the expenses can be measured reliably and sufficient resources to complete the development project are available. Development costs that do not meet these criteria and all research costs are recognized immediately in profit or loss. The capitalized development costs are amortized on a straight-line basis from the date of launch, typically over five to seven years. While a development project is still in progress, the amounts capitalized to date are tested for impairment at least annually.

The lease liability is recognized at the amount of the future lease payments discounted at the incremental borrowing rate over the entire term of the lease. During the term of the lease, the lease liability is carried forward using the effective interest method and taking lease payments into account. The right-of-use asset is recognized at the amount of the lease liability plus initial direct costs. In subsequent periods, the right-of-use asset is to be amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease or the economic life, when this is shorter. The right-of-use assets shown in the statement of financial position are reported in those statement of financial position items in which the assets to which the lease relates would have been reported if the RENK Group had owned them. The right-of-use assets are therefore reported under non-current assets in property, plant and equipment as of the end of the reporting period. The practical expedients applied for short-term and low-value leases mean that no right-of-use asset or lease liability is recognized for these leases. The lease payments for these are recognized in the income statement as an expense. Low-value leases are leases where the new value of the leased asset does not exceed € 5,000. Leases with a total term of up to 12 months are classed as short-term. The IFRS 16 accounting requirements are not applied to leases for intangible assets. Many leases include extension and termination options. All relevant factors and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise or not exercise the option are taken into account when determining the lease terms. Optional periods are taken into account when determining the lease term if it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised or not exercised. Lessors distinguish between finance and operating leases on the basis of the distribution of the risks and opportunities from the asset. Assets from operating leases are carried at cost and depreciated to their residual value on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Impairment is recognized in the form of write-downs and adjustments to the lease installments. Lease payments received in the period are recognized as income in the income statement. RENK did not act as a lessor in the fiscal year 2019 or in the previous year.

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, capitalized development costs and goodwill are tested for impairment at least annually. With the exception of the capitalized goodwill from the Horstman acquisition, none of these statement of financial position items were subject to an annual impairment test as of the end of the 2019 and 2018 reporting periods at the RENK Group. The recoverable amount of the asset in question is calculated to determine the extent of a possible impairment loss. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and value in use. The value in use is the present value of the expected cash flows determined on the basis of current planning by the management. This planning is based on expectations regarding future development of the various individual markets. Appropriate assumptions about macroeconomic trends (development of currency, interest and commodities prices) and historical developments are taken into account. The planning period covers a five-year period. Please see the forecast in the Management Report for information on the assumptions in the detailed planning period. Plausible assumptions on future developments are made for subsequent years. Planning assumptions are adjusted to take account of current knowledge. The calculation of cash flows is based on expected growth rates for the markets in question. The cash flows estimate after the end of the planning period is based on a growth rate identical to the previous year of up to 1% p.a. A weighted average cost of capital before taxes (WACC) that reflects the market conditions is used as the discount rate. The discount rate is calculated on the basis of the interest rate for risk-free investments, a market risk premium and the borrowing rate and taking into account specific peer group information for the beta factors and the debt-to-equity ratio. The underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and adjusted as necessary. The weighted average cost of capital applied in the fiscal year 2019 was 6.5% (previous year: 7.7%). If a recoverable amount cannot be determined for an individual asset, the recoverable amount of the smallest identifiable cash-generating unit to which the asset in question can be assigned is determined. If the recoverable amount of an asset is lower than its carrying amount, an impairment loss on the asset is immediately recognized in profit or loss. If an asset or cash-generating unit on which an impairment loss was recognized later has a higher recoverable amount, an impairment loss is reversed up to no higher than the amortized cost that would have resulted without the impairment. The impairment loss is reversed in profit or loss and is recognized in other operating income. The reversal of impairment losses on goodwill is not permitted. The write-down for the carrying amounts of investments in the non-consolidated subsidiaries was reversed through profit or loss in the amount of € 2,021 thousand at the RENK Group as of December 31, 2019 (previous year: no reversal).

Regular way purchases and sales of financial instruments are recognized at the settlement date, i.e. the date on which the asset is delivered. Primary financial instruments include, in particular, trade receivables, financial investments, securities, cash and cash equivalents, financial liabilities and trade payables. Primary financial instruments are carried at fair value less or plus transaction costs on initial recognition. This excludes financial instruments recognized at fair value through profit or loss and trade receivables that do not have significant financing components, which are recognized at transaction price in accordance with IFRS 15. Fair value on initial measurement is generally the transaction price, i.e. the consideration given or received. On initial recognition, financial assets are classified as follows based on the business model applied and the structure of cash flows: - at amortized cost; - at fair value through other comprehensive income (debt instruments); - at fair value through other comprehensive income (equity instruments); - at fair value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities are assigned to the following categories: - at amortized cost; - at fair value through profit or loss. The option of recognizing financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss is not exercised in the RENK Group. Subsidiaries that are not consolidated for reasons of materiality and financial instruments from rights and obligations under IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” are not assigned to a measurement category under IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”, though the impairment provisions of IFRS 9 must be taken into account for the latter financial assets on account of an exemption.

If a change in an estimate results in a reduction of the obligation, the provision is reversed accordingly and the income is recognized in the corresponding functions or in other operating income. Provisions for warranties are recognized at the time of sale of the products concerned or the performance of the relevant service. Their measurement is primarily based on historical experience. Individual provisions are also recognized for known losses. Provisions for restructuring measures are recognized when the Group has produced a detailed, formal plan of measures containing information on the division affected, the estimated number of employees and a cost estimate and the parties concerned or their representatives have been informed accordingly. Provisions for outstanding costs and other commitments are measured on the basis of services yet to be performed, usually in the amount of the production costs expected to be incurred.

364,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,103,INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT,103.136,(o)** **Estimates and judgments,103.136.1,,"When preparing consolidated financial statements, to a certain extent assumptions and estimates are made that affect the amount and reporting of the recognized assets and liabilities, income and expenses and information on contingent assets and liabilities in the reporting period. The estimates were made on the basis of past experience and other relevant factors, including the assumption of going concern. All estimates and assumptions are made to the best of knowledge and belief to provide a true and fair view of the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the Group. Any uncertainty is adequately reflected in valuations, although future events can still differ from these estimates and have a material effect on the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the RENK Group. Estimates and judgments are reviewed on an ongoing basis. The assumptions made regarding the following matters as of the end of the reporting period are of particular significance: If intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets, other equity investments and financial investments, other receivables or goodwill are tested for impairment, this requires a forecast of future cash flows for the calculation of the recoverable amount and their discounting, among other things. Such cash flows are based on forecasts that are in turn based on the business and financial planning approved by the management. Other material assumptions relate to the weighted average cost of capital and tax rates. Estimates of the useful life of depreciable assets are based on past experience. If, in the context of the review of useful life, a change is made in estimates, the remaining useful life is adjusted and any impairment loss is recognized. Recognizing the leases in the form of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability requires estimates on the lease term of the relevant lease components. It must be assessed whether it is reasonably certain that the contractually agreed extension, termination and call options will be exercised. The estimate for the initial recognition of the lease components determines the amount of the lease liability and thus the right-of-use asset. Changes to the estimate in subsequent periods result in a change to the residual values of statement of financial position items related to leases. Individual performance obligations are accounted for over time using the percentage of completion method. Sales revenue is accounted for using the percentage of completion method. This method places considerable importance on accurate estimates of the percentage of completion. Depending on which method is used to determine the percentage of completion, significant estimates include contract revenue, total contract costs, the remaining costs to completion, contract risks and other assessments. The management of the operating units is continuously reviewing the estimates for such performance obligations and adjusts them as necessary. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

364,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,103,INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT,103.141,IFRS 16 “Leases”,103.141.1,,"The RENK Group has applied IFRS 16 since January 1, 2019. IFRS 16 amends the provisions for accounting for leases and supersedes the previous Standard IAS 17 and its associated interpretations. The central objective of IFRS 16 is the recognition of all leases in the statement of financial position. Accordingly, lessees will no longer distinguish between finance and operating leases. Instead, they must recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases in their statement of financial position. In the RENK Group, the lease liability is measured using the outstanding lease payments discounted at the incremental borrowing rate, while the right-of-use asset is measured at the amount of the lease liability. Here, the option is exercised to exclude initial direct costs at the date of initial application. During the term of the lease, the right-of-use asset must be amortized and the lease liability must be carried forward using the effective interest method and taking lease payments into account. IFRS 16 allows practical expedients used by the RENK Group for short-term and low-value leases, and therefore right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are not recognized for such leases. These lease payments continue to be recognized as expenses in the income statement. At the time of adoption, leases ending before January 1, 2020 were classified as current leases regardless of when they began. As of January 1, 2019, the RENK Group accounted for leases using the modified retrospective transition method in accordance with IFRS 16 for the first time. The prior-year periods were not adjusted. Under this method, the lease liability must be recognized at the present value of the outstanding lease payments as of the transition date. The present value is calculated based on incremental borrowing rates as of January 1, 2019. The weighted average interest rate for this in the RENK Group was 2.1%. The leases essentially include office and warehouse space and vehicles. The normal lease term is between one and five years. By way of simplification, the right-of-use assets are recognized at the amount of the respective lease liability adjusted for any prepaid or accrued lease payments. Right-of-use assets were not tested for impairment as of the adoption date as there was no evidence of impairment on operating leases as of December 31, 2018. The right-of-use assets shown in the statement of financial position are reported in those statement of financial position items in which the assets to which the lease relates would have been reported if the RENK Group had owned them. The right-of-use assets are therefore reported under non-current assets in property, plant and equipment as of the end of the reporting period. The first-time recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities gave rise to the following effects as of January 1, 2019: - Right-of-use assets of € 5,182 thousand were recognized under property, plant and equipment in the opening statement of financial position. - Lease liabilities of € 5,182 thousand were reported under current and non-current financial liabilities. - Adoption had no effect on equity. The difference between expected payments for operating leases of € 4,907 thousand discounted using the incremental borrowing rate as of December 31, 2018 and the lease liabilities of € 5,182 thousand recognized in the opening statement of financial position essentially results from the reassessment of lease terms in accordance with IFRS 16.

In addition, lease payments for low-value and short-term leases are not included in lease liabilities in the opening statement of financial position. Unlike under the previous approach, where expenses for operating leases were shown in full in operating profit, under IFRS 16 only the amortization of rights of use is shown in operating profit. Interest expenses on lease liabilities are reported in the financial result. This improved the operating profit by € 179 thousand in the 2019 fiscal year. The change in the recognition of operating lease expenses in the statement of cash flows resulted in an improvement in cash flow from operating activities of € 1,076 thousand as of December 31, 2019. Cash flows from financing activities were increased accordingly. The increase in financial liabilities resulting from the change in accounting policies had a negative impact of € 6,345 thousand on the RENK Group’s net liquidity as of December 31, 2019.

Under these changes, certain financial instruments that include a repayment option with negative compensation can be measured at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income. - Since January 1, 2019, amendments have been issued for IAS 19 “Employee Benefits” in plan amendment, curtailment or settlement. These require the current service cost and net interest for the rest of the fiscal year to be remeasured using the current actuarial assumptions. They also clarified the effect of a plan amendment, curtailment or settlement on the requirements regarding the asset ceiling. The new regulation results in the following additional qualitative disclosures at the RENK Group, but does not have any impact on the net assets, financial position and results of operations. - As of January 1, 2019, the amendment to IAS 28 “Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures” clarified that the impairment requirements under IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” are to be applied to long-term interests in associates and joint ventures that essentially represent a net investment and that are not recognized in accordance with the equity method. - The IFRIC 23 interpretation “Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments”has been in force since January 1, 2019 and requires tax risks to be taken into account if tax authorities are unlikely to accept tax treatments. - Various regulations have become effective since January 1, 2019 as part of the 2017 improvement of International Financial Reporting Standards (Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2015-2017 Cycle).

All shares are fully paid up. Volkswagen Vermögensverwaltungs-GmbH (formerly: Volkswagen Klassik GmbH), Wolfsburg, held 76% of the subscribed capital of RENK AG in the year under review. A total of 199,903 treasury shares or 2.86% of the share capital (share of capital: € 512 thousand) were held by the company on December 31, 2019. The difference between the accounting par value and the cost of the acquisition of the treasury shares in the amount of € 3,501 thousand is offset in retained earnings. The capital reserves relate exclusively to share premiums in the context of capital increases by RENK AG. The accumulated other comprehensive income predominantly results from the fair value measurement of provisions for pension obligations. In accordance with the provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act, the net retained profits of the Group parent RENK AG are available for distributions. The net retained profits of RENK AG amount to € 33,698 thousand as of December 31, 2019. The Executive Board and the Supervisory Board will propose to the Annual General Meeting the distribution of a dividend for fiscal 2019 unchanged as against the previous year of € 2.20 per share.

This provides reliable additional income on retirement and risk protection for disability and death. Under the current pension plans, the active employees receive employer contributions linked to their remuneration and, in addition, also have the option of personal provision through deferred compensation (paid for by the employer for employees subject to collective bargaining agreements). When actively working, employees accrue pension capital from employer- and employee-financed contributions and returns from investment on the capital market. On retirement this pension capital is paid out as a lump sum or in installments, or in certain cases can be converted into an annuity. Employees’ investment risks are gradually reduced with increasing age (lifecycle concept). The performance of the pension capital is derived from the return on the investments. As required by law, at least the total contributions paid for the employee will be paid out on retirement. Former employees, including pensioners and employees who have left the plan with vested benefits, have pension commitments from closed pension funds, which are predominantly geared towards providing lifetime annuity payments. These commitments entail the usual longevity and inflation risks, which are regularly monitored and evaluated. The domestic pension assets of the RENK Group are managed by the MAN Pension Trust e.V. and MAN Pensionsfonds AG. These assets are irrevocably unavailable to the RENK companies and must be used exclusively to fund current pension payments or for employee claims in the event of insolvency. The proper management and use of trust assets is monitored by independent trustees. MAN Pensionsfonds AG is also subject to the supervision of the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin). The pension assets are invested by professional investment managers according to investment guidelines set by an Investment Committee. The strategic allocation of plan assets is based on asset liability management studies conducted at regular intervals.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

(2) Corresponds to the measurement category “Financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss” under IFRS 9. (3) Corresponds to the measurement category “Financial instruments measured at amortized cost” under IFRS 9. The following table shows the carrying amounts, the measurement categories by class, the fair values and the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 9 as of December 31, 2018: The fair values were calculated based on the market conditions at the end of the reporting period and the measurement methods described below. They are the prices at which one party would assume the rights or obligations from these financial instruments from an independent third party. There were no significant changes since the previous year in the measurement methods applied. Cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, other financial assets, financial liabilities, trade payables and miscellaneous financial liabilities predominantly have a short remaining term. Their carrying amounts as of the end of the reporting period therefore approximately match their fair value. Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income include unchanged equity shares of € 2,975 thousand (previous year: € 2,975 thousand) for which the RENK Group exercises the option for measurement at fair value through other comprehensive income. There were no changes recognized in other comprehensive income in the reporting period (previous year: € 552 thousand). In particular, the respective corporate planning and the company-specific discount rates are used to measure the equity instruments at fair value (level 3). Of the inputs used to calculate the fair value of the equity investments, only the cost of capital before taxes has changed compared to December 31, 2018. This was 7.1% as of December 31, 2019 (December 31, 2018: 7.7%). A change in the significant, unobservable inputs has no significant effect on equity or profit after tax, either in isolation or combination. Total dividends of € 699 thousand were received in the reporting period (previous year: € 1,979 thousand). The future cash flows for derivative financial instruments without option components, particularly currency forwards, are calculated using forward curves. The fair value of these instruments is the total of the discounted cash flows. The options on currency pairs are measured on the basis of standard option pricing models, i.e. generalized Black-Scholes formulas. Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are level 2 of the fair value hierarchy with the exception of other equity investments, which are level 3. With the exception of cash and cash equivalents, which are allocated to level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, all other financial assets and liabilities at amortized cost are allocated to level 2 of the fair value hierarchy: Interest income on impaired financial assets is of secondary importance due to the usually short time before the expected payment. The following tables contain information on possible offsetting effects on the consolidated statement of financial position and the financial impact of offsetting in the case of instruments which are subject to a legally enforceable master offsetting agreement or similar agreement. The “Financial instruments”column shows the amounts that are the subject of a master offsetting agreement, but that cannot be offset because the conditions have not been met. Offsetting can only occur given certain future events, such as the insolvency of one of the parties. The columns “Collateral received” and “Collateral provided” show the amounts of cash collateral or collateral in the form of financial instruments received/ pledged in relation to the total amount of assets and liabilities. The net gains or losses from assets at fair value through other comprehensive income comprise the net income from other and financial investments. The net gains or losses from financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss include changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments not used in hedge accounting. The net gains or losses from financial liabilities at cost mainly result from currency translation.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

Liquidity management and investment in the MAN Group is centralized under Groupwide cash management.

As of the end of the reporting period, RENK’s foreign exchange exposure is primarily from transactions in USD, CHF, JPY, CNY and GBP.

RENK was included in the liquidity management system of the MAN Group in the year under review on the basis of a service agreement. To limit this risk, inflows and outflows of cash and maturities are monitored and managed at all times. Financing requirements are covered by both operating cash flow and external financing. There were therefore no significant risk clusters in the past fiscal year. Cash for the operating units is essentially managed centrally as part of cash pooling. The cash and cash equivalents of the Group companies and MAN SE are merged daily. Thus, liquidity surpluses and requirements can be managed as necessary. For external financing, the opportunities on the financial markets are tracked continuously to ensure financial flexibility and to limit refinancing risks. In certain countries (such as Brazil and China), the Group can only dispose over local cash and cash equivalents internationally in compliance with the applicable foreign exchange restrictions. Other than this there are no significant restrictions. Cash and cash equivalents are essentially used to finance working capital and short-term obligations.

The current remuneration system is based on the recommendation found in the version of the Code dated May 5, 2015. The Supervisory Board considers a long-term assessment basis that is essentially forward-looking to be appropriate and is preparing an adjustment of the remuneration system. However, this is to be based on the recommendations included in the version of the Code issued on May 9, 2019 but which is not yet effective. - Regarding the recommendation in items 5.4.1(6) to (8) of the Code on the disclosure of certain circumstances of nominations by the Supervisory Board to the Annual General Meeting, the requirements of the Code are unspecific and unclear in their application. A departure from the Code as regards this matter has thus been declared as a precaution. Regardless of this, the Supervisory Board will endeavor to comply with the requirements of items 5.4.1(6) to (8) of the Code. - The recommendation of item 7.1.1 sentence 2 (intra-year financial information) is not complied with as the Executive Board and Supervisory Board of RENK AG consider an obligation to release quarterly publications in addition to the statutory requirement of the Wertpapierhandelsgesetz (WpHG—German Securities Trading Act) to be unnecessary.” Augsburg, December 2019 For the Supervisory Board For the Executive Board Dr. Ingrun-Ulla Bartölke Florian Hofbauer",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

364,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,103,INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT,103.284,Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements,103.284.1,,"Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2019. These ----- matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters. In our view, the matters of most significance in our audit were as follows: ❶ Management and measurement of inventories ❷ Acquisition of the Horstman Group Our presentation of these key audit matters has been structured in each case as follows: ➀ Matter and issue ➁ Audit approach and findings ➂ Reference to further information Hereinafter we present the key audit matters: ❶ Management and measurement of inventories ➀ EUR 41 million in raw materials, consumables and supplies, EUR 187 million in work in progress, and EUR 3 million in prepayments were recognized under “Inventories” in the consolidated statement of financial position of Renk Aktiengesellschaft, Augsburg. From our point of view, this balance sheet item is of particular importance due to its material amount and the fact that the measurement of inventories is to a large extent based on estimates and assumptions made by management. The reliability of the processes and controls put in place is also a material requirement for managing inventories of work in progress. ➁ Given that the management and measurement complexity of inventories gives rise to an increased risk of accounting misstatements, we assessed the Group’s processes and controls relating to the management and measurement of inventories. Our specific audit approach included testing of the controls and substantive audit procedures, in particular: - observing stocktaking at multiple sites; - auditing the measurement of inventories. We verified the appropriateness of the systems, processes and controls in place, and that the estimates and assumptions made by management are sufficiently substantiated and documented. ➂ The Company’s disclosures relating to inventories are contained in notes (3)(g) and (18) to the consolidated financial statements. ❷ Acquisition of the Horstman Group ➀ With effect from April 16, 2019, Renk Aktiengesellschaft acquired 100% of the shares of the Horstman Group. The total purchase price for the acquisition was EUR 44.4 million. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method in accordance with IFRS 3. During the purchase price allocation, the identified assets and assumed liabilities and contingent liabilities of the company acquired were recognized at their fair values. Taking into account the acquired net assets of EUR 38.7 million that are to be allocated to the Company, the acquired goodwill amounted to EUR 5.7 million. Due to the estimation uncertainties involved in measuring the assets and liabilities as part of the purchase price allocation, and the overall material impact of the amounts involved in the acquisition on the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the RENK Group, this matter was of particular significance in the context of our audit. ➁ In auditing the acquisition of the Horstman Group, we initially inspected and reviewed the contractual agreements and reconciled the purchase price agreed as consideration for the shares received with the supporting payment documentation provided to us. On this basis, we reviewed the balance sheet underlying the acquisition based on the fair values as of the date of first-time consolidation. This involved assessing the appropriateness of, among other things, the models employed for the valuations as well as the valuation inputs and assumptions used. Given the special features involved in calculating the fair values in the context of the purchase price allocation, our valuation specialists assisted in the process. We also assessed the disclosures in the notes to the financial statements that are required under IFRS 3. ----- Overall, we were able to satisfy ourselves that this acquisition was correctly presented in the financial statements and that the estimates and assumptions made by the executive directors are comprehensible and adequately substantiated. ➂ The Company’s disclosures relating to the acquisition are contained in sections (3)(n) and (14) of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

In addition the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so. Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with § 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report. We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems. - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures. - Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern. - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB. - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions. - Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides. - Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. ----- We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, the related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.

The accompanying Combined Financial Statements are not necessarily indicative of the financial position, results of operations or cash flows that would have been achieved if the Business had operated as a separate, standalone entity as of or during any of the periods presented, nor are they indicative of the financial position or results going forward due to the changes in the business. Our Combined Balance Sheet includes the assets and liabilities of CPS. L3Harris uses a centralized approach to cash management and financing of its operations in various jurisdictions. The cash of CPS’s U.S. entity is transferred to a L3Harris corporate bank account daily and L3Harris funds CPS’s working capital and capital expenditure requirements as needed. The cash of CPS’s U.S. entity transferred to L3Harris has been excluded from these Combined Financial Statements. Although employees of the Business may participate in one or more defined benefit plans sponsored by L3Harris and the Business is allocated a proportionate share of the associated net periodic benefit income, L3Harris is retaining the defined benefit plan obligations and therefore no portion of plan assets or benefit obligations has been allocated to the Business. Net parent investment represents L3Harris’s interest in the recorded net assets of CPS. Assets and liabilities for amounts due to or due from CPS and L3Harris are included in the “Net parent investment” line item in our Combined Balance Sheet. CPS receives services and support from various functions performed by L3Harris and CPS’ operations have been dependent upon L3Harris’s ability to perform these services and support functions. Shared corporate functions include, but are not limited to, executive and segment oversight, finance, legal, human resources and information technology (“IT”). With the exception of IT costs, the costs of shared corporate and segment functions are primarily allocated based on a three-factor formula that considers the Business’ revenue, headcount and fixed assets relative to L3Harris’ consolidated revenue, headcount and fixed assets. IT costs have been allocated based on headcount. Where costs have been allocated to the Business, such allocations are considered to represent a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services by, or benefit provided to, CPS, and we believe the accompanying Combined Financial Statements include all costs of doing business. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

See Note 14: Related Party Transactions in these Notes for additional information regarding corporate and segment level costs included in the accompanying Combined Financial Statements. Contract assets related to amounts withheld by customers until contract completion are not considered a significant financing component of our contracts because the intent is to protect the customers from our failure to satisfactorily complete our performance obligations. Payments received from customers in advance of revenue recognition are not considered a significant financing component of our contracts because they are utilized to pay for contract costs within a one-year period or are requested by us to ensure the customers meet their payment obligations. See Note 3: Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities in these Notes for additional information. valuation allowances reflected in the Combined Financial Statements are based on a hypothetical stand-alone income tax return basis and may not exist in the L3Harris consolidated financial statements. See Note 11: _Income Taxes in these Notes. ._ The evaluation of tax positions taken in a filed tax return or planned to be taken in a future tax return or claim, involves inherent uncertainty and requires the use of judgment. We evaluate our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances as of the reporting date. For tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be realized, we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent probability of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority, assuming the taxing authority has full knowledge of all relevant information. For income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be realized, we do not recognize a tax benefit in the Combined Financial Statements. Any accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions is included in the financial statements as a component of income tax expense. generally consider the spare parts distinct in the context of the contract and account for them as separate performance obligations. Contracts to manufacture engines and transmissions often result in the delivery of distinct units in a series that are substantially the same. We account for each series of engines or transmissions that are substantially the same as a single performance obligation. We recognize revenue on our engine and transmission contracts using the percentage of completion (“POC”) revenue recognition method as there is no alternative use for the engines, transmissions and spare parts and our contracts include progress payment provisions that provide for the right to bill for cost and profit for work performed to date. A portion of our revenue is derived from the provision of technical support services. Orders for technical support services are typically considered a separate contract. Revenue for technical support services is recognized using the POC cost-to-cost revenue recognition method. Shipping and handling costs incurred after control of a product has transferred to the customer (for example, in free on board shipping arrangements) are treated as fulfillment costs and, therefore, are not accounted for as separate performance obligations. Also, we record taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities on a net basis in that they are excluded from revenue. As noted above, our contracts are occasionally modified to include changes in specifications, requirements or price. Depending on the nature of the modification, we consider whether to account for the modification as an adjustment to the existing contract or as a separate contract. Often, given each deliverable within the original contract is distinct, when a customer orders additional similar deliverables, the additional deliverables in our contract modifications are distinct and accounted for as a separate contract. We determine the transaction price for each contract based on our best estimate of the consideration we expect to receive, which in limited cases includes assumptions regarding variable consideration, such consideration for cost-reimbursable technical support service contracts. We include such estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. We estimate variable consideration primarily using the most likely amount method. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price of the good or service underlying each performance obligation. The standalone selling price represents the amount for which we would sell the good or service to a customer on a standalone basis (i.e., not sold as a bundle with any other products or services). Our contracts with the U.S. Government, including foreign military sales contracts, are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (“FAR”) and the prices of our contract deliverables are typically based on our estimated or actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin. As a result, the standalone selling prices of the goods and services in these contracts are typically equal to the selling prices stated in the contract, thereby, eliminating the need to allocate (or reallocate) the transaction price to the multiple performance obligations. In our non-U.S. Government contracts, we also generally use the expected cost plus a reasonable profit margin approach to determine standalone selling price. In addition, we determine standalone selling price for certain contracts that are commercial in nature based on observable selling prices. We recognize revenue for each performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of the promised goods or services underlying the performance obligation to the customer. The transfer of control for substantially all of our revenues occurs over time. Over Time Revenue Recognition:_ For U.S. Government development and production contracts, there is a continuous transfer of control of the asset to the customer as it is being produced based on FAR clauses in the contract that provide the customer with lien rights to work in process and allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience, pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit and take control of any work in process. This also typically applies to our contracts with prime contractors for U.S. Government development and production contracts, when the above-described FAR clauses are flowed down to us by the prime contractors. Our non-U.S. Government development and production contracts often do not include the FAR clauses described above. However, over time revenue recognition is typically supported either through our performance creating or enhancing an asset that the customer controls as it is created or enhanced or based ----- on other contractual provisions or relevant laws that provide us with an enforceable right to payment for our work performed to date plus a reasonable profit if our customer were permitted to and did terminate the contract for reasons other than our failure to perform as promised. Over time revenue recognition for our non-U.S. Government services contracts are typically supported by the customer consuming the benefits from the services as we perform them. Revenue for our development and production contracts is recognized over time, typically using the series guidance where deliverables are substantially the same and represent a performance obligation satisfied over time. For performance obligations to provide services that are satisfied over time, we recognize revenue using the POC cost-to-cost method. Contract Estimates:_ Under the POC cost-to-cost method of revenue recognition, a single estimated profit margin is used to recognize profit for each performance obligation over its period of performance. Recognition of profit on a contract requires estimates of the total cost at completion and transaction price and the measurement of progress towards completion. Due to the long-term nature of some of our contracts, developing the estimated total cost at completion and total transaction price often requires judgment. Factors that must be considered in estimating the cost of the work to be completed include the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, subcontractor performance and the risk and impact of delayed performance. Factors that must be considered in estimating the total transaction price include contractual cost as well as our historical experience and our expectation for performance on the contract. At the outset of each contract, we gauge its complexity and perceived risks and establish an estimated total cost at completion in line with these expectations. After establishing the estimated total cost at completion, we follow a standard Estimate at Completion (“EAC”) process in which we review the progress and performance on our ongoing contracts at least quarterly and, in many cases, more frequently. If we successfully retire risks associated with the technical, schedule and cost aspects of a contract, we may lower our estimated total cost at completion commensurate with the retirement of these risks. Conversely, if we are not successful in retiring these risks, we may increase our estimated total cost at completion. Additionally, as the contract progresses, our estimates of total transaction price may increase or decrease if, for example, we receive award fees that are higher or lower than expected. When adjustments in estimated total costs at completion or in estimated total transaction price are determined, the related impact on operating income is recognized using the cumulative catch-up method, which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of such adjustments for all prior periods. Any anticipated losses on these contracts are fully recognized in the period in which the losses become evident. Net EAC adjustments had the following impact to earnings for the periods presented (in thousands): **2020** **2019** Net EAC adjustments, before income taxes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $28,378 $23,948 Net EAC adjustments, net of income taxes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $21,057 $18,728 Revenue recognized from performance obligations satisfied in prior periods was $29,135 and $21,729 in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. Backlog:_ Backlog, which is the equivalent of our remaining performance obligations, represents the future revenue we expect to recognize as we perform on our current contracts. Backlog comprises both funded backlog (i.e., firm orders for which funding is authorized and appropriated) and unfunded backlog. Backlog excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts, such as indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (“IDIQ”) contracts. Disaggregation of Revenue:_ We disaggregate revenue by customer relationship, contract type and geographical region. We believe these categories best depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

Costs to fulfill a contract include costs directly related to a contract or specific anticipated contract (for example, mobilization, set-up and certain design costs) that generate or enhance our ability to satisfy our performance obligations under these contracts. These costs are capitalized to the extent they are expected to be recovered from the associated contract. Capitalized costs to obtain or fulfill a contract are amortized to expense over the expected period of benefit for contracts with terms greater than one year on a systematic basis that is consistent with the pattern of transfer of the associated goods and services to the customer. As a practical expedient, capitalized costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a term of one year or less are expensed as incurred.

We initially record goodwill for the amount the consideration transferred exceeds the acquisition-date fair value of net identifiable assets acquired. We test goodwill for impairment at a level within the Business referred to as the reporting unit. We test our goodwill for impairment annually as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter, or under certain circumstances, more frequently, such as when events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment. Such events or circumstances may include a significant deterioration in overall economic conditions, changes in the business climate of our industry, a decline in our market capitalization, operating performance indicators, competition, reorganizations of our business or the disposal of all or a portion of a reporting unit. To test goodwill for impairment, we may perform both qualitative and quantitative assessments. If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the probability that goodwill is impaired. If we determine it is more likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we measure any loss from an impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired, and an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

We did not have any finance leases at January 1, 2021 and January 3, 2020. Operating lease assets are included in the “Operating lease right-of-use assets” line item in our Combined Balance Sheet. Operating lease liabilities for obligations due within twelve months are included in the “Other accrued items” line item in our Combined Balance Sheet. Operating lease liabilities for obligations due longer than twelve months are included in the “Operating lease liabilities” line item in our Combined Balance Sheet. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future lease payments. Lease payments include base rent. Our lease payments also include non-lease components such as real estate taxes and common-area maintenance costs. As a practical expedient, we account for lease and non-lease components as a single component. The present value of future lease payments is determined using our incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement over the expected lease term. We use our incremental borrowing rate because our leases do not provide an implicit lease rate. The expected lease term represents the number of years we expect to lease the property, including options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option.

We follow very specific and detailed guidelines in each tax jurisdiction regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide necessary valuation allowances as required. The Business regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. The Business calculated the provision for income taxes using a “separate return” method. Under this method, the Business assumes it will file separate returns with tax authorities, thereby reporting its taxable income or loss and paying the applicable tax to or receiving the appropriate refund from L3Harris. As a result, the Business’s deferred tax balances and effective tax rate as a stand-alone entity will likely differ significantly from those recognized in historical periods.

Our standard warranties start from the shipment, delivery or customer acceptance date and typically range from one to two years. Because our products are manufactured, in many cases, to customer specifications and their acceptance is based on meeting those specifications, we historically have experienced minimal warranty costs.

At the inception of each contract, we evaluate the promised goods and services to determine whether the contract should be accounted for as having one or more performance obligations. A performance obligation is a promise to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer and represents the unit of accounting for revenue recognition. A substantial majority of our revenue is derived from long-term development and production contracts involving the design, development, manufacture or modification of engines and/or transmissions for military combat vehicles and spare parts according to customer’s specifications.

The accompanying Combined Financial Statements are not necessarily indicative of the financial position, results of operations or cash flows that would have been achieved if the Business had operated as a separate, standalone entity as of or during any of the periods presented, nor are they indicative of the financial position or results going forward due to the changes in the business. Our Combined Balance Sheet includes the assets and liabilities of CPS. L3Harris uses a centralized approach to cash management and financing of its operations in various jurisdictions. The cash of CPS’s U.S. entity is transferred to a L3Harris corporate bank account daily and L3Harris funds CPS’s working capital and capital expenditure requirements as needed. The cash of CPS’s U.S. entity transferred to L3Harris has been excluded from these Combined Financial Statements. Although employees of the Business may participate in one or more defined benefit plans sponsored by L3Harris and the Business is allocated a proportionate share of the associated net periodic benefit income, L3Harris is retaining the defined benefit plan obligations and therefore no portion of plan assets or benefit obligations has been allocated to the Business. Net parent investment represents L3Harris’s interest in the recorded net assets of CPS. Assets and liabilities for amounts due to or due from CPS and L3Harris are included in the “Net parent investment” line item in our Combined Balance Sheet. CPS receives services and support from various functions performed by L3Harris and CPS’ operations have been dependent upon L3Harris’s ability to perform these services and support functions. Shared corporate functions include, but are not limited to, executive and segment oversight, finance, legal, human resources and information technology (“IT”). With the exception of IT costs, the costs of shared corporate and segment functions are primarily allocated based on a three-factor formula that considers the Business’ revenue, headcount and fixed assets relative to L3Harris’ consolidated revenue, headcount and fixed assets. IT costs have been allocated based on headcount. Where costs have been allocated to the Business, such allocations are considered to represent a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services by, or benefit provided to, CPS, and we believe the accompanying Combined Financial Statements include all costs of doing business. However, the allocations may not be indicative of the actual expense that would have been incurred had CPS operated as an independent, -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

Payments received from customers in advance of revenue recognition are not considered a significant financing component of our contracts because they are utilized to pay for contract costs within a one-year period or are requested by us to ensure the customers meet their payment obligations. See Note B: Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities in these Notes for additional information. recoverability of the carrying value of our long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. We evaluate the recoverability of such assets based on the expectations of undiscounted cash flows from such assets. If the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss would be recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount. We did not have any indefinite-lived intangible assets at April 2, 2021 and January 1, 2021. See Note D: Property, Plant _and Equipment and Note E: Goodwill and Intangibles in these Notes for additional information regarding_ long-lived assets and intangible assets, respectively. The evaluation of tax positions taken in a filed tax return, or planned to be taken in a future tax return or claim, involves inherent uncertainty and requires the use of judgment. We evaluate our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances as of the reporting date. For tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be realized, we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent probability of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority, assuming the taxing authority has full knowledge of all relevant information. For income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be realized, we do not recognize a tax benefit in our Combined Financial Statements. In general, the taxable income (loss) of the Business was included in the L3Harris consolidated tax returns. As such, separate income tax returns were not prepared for the individual entities included within the combined financial statements. Consequently, income taxes currently payable are deemed to have been remitted to L3Harris in the period in which the liability arose, and income taxes currently receivable are deemed to have been received from the Business in the period in which the receivable arose. See Note H: Income Taxes in these Notes. that include both development/production of engines or transmissions and the provision of spare parts, we generally consider the spare parts distinct in the context of the contract and account for them as separate performance obligations. Contracts to manufacture engines and transmissions often result in the delivery of distinct units in a series that are substantially the same. We account for each series of engines or transmissions that are substantially the same as a single performance obligation. We recognize revenue on our engine and transmission contracts using the percentage of completion (“POC”) revenue recognition method as there is no alternative use for the engines, transmissions and spare parts and our contracts include progress payment provisions that provide for the right to bill for cost and profit for work performed to date. A portion of our revenue is derived from the provision of technical support services. Orders for technical support services are typically considered a separate contract. Revenue for technical support services is recognized using the POC cost-to-cost revenue recognition method. Shipping and handling costs incurred after control of a product has transferred to the customer (for example, in free on board shipping arrangements) are treated as fulfillment costs and, therefore, are not accounted for as separate performance obligations. Also, we record taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities on a net basis in that they are excluded from revenue. As noted above, our contracts are occasionally modified to include changes in specifications, requirements or price. Depending on the nature of the modification, we consider whether to account for the modification as an adjustment to the existing contract or as a separate contract. Often, given each deliverable within the original contract is distinct, when a customer orders additional similar deliverables, the additional deliverables in our contract modifications are distinct and accounted for as a separate contract. We determine the transaction price for each contract based on our best estimate of the consideration we expect to receive, which in limited cases includes assumptions regarding variable consideration, such consideration for cost-reimbursable technical support service contracts. We include such estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. We estimate variable consideration primarily using the most likely amount method. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price of the good or service underlying each performance obligation. The standalone selling price represents the amount for which we would sell the good or service to a customer on a standalone basis (i.e., not sold as a bundle with any other products or services). Our contracts with the U.S. Government, including foreign military sales contracts, are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (“FAR”) and the prices of our contract deliverables are typically based on our estimated or actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin. As a result, the standalone selling prices of the goods and services in these contracts are typically equal to the selling prices stated in the contract, thereby, eliminating the need to allocate (or reallocate) the transaction price to the multiple performance obligations. In our non-U.S. Government contracts, we also generally use the expected cost plus a reasonable profit margin approach to determine standalone selling price. In addition, we determine standalone selling price for certain contracts that are commercial in nature based on observable selling prices. We recognize revenue for each performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of the promised goods or services underlying the performance obligation to the customer. The transfer of control for substantially all of our revenues occurs over time. Over Time Revenue Recognition:_ For U.S. Government development and production contracts, there is a continuous transfer of control of the asset to the customer as it is being produced based on FAR clauses in the contract that provide the customer with lien rights to work in process and allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience, pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit and take control of any work in process. This also typically applies to our contracts with prime contractors for U.S. Government development and production contracts, when the above-described FAR clauses are flowed down to us by the prime contractors. Our non-U.S. Government development and production contracts often do not include the FAR clauses described above. However, over time revenue recognition is typically supported either through our ----- performance creating or enhancing an asset that the customer controls as it is created or enhanced or based on other contractual provisions or relevant laws that provide us with an enforceable right to payment for our work performed to date plus a reasonable profit if our customer were permitted to and did terminate the contract for reasons other than our failure to perform as promised. Over time revenue recognition for our non-U.S. Government services contracts are typically supported by the customer consuming the benefits from the services as we perform them. Revenue for our development and production contracts is recognized over time, typically using the series guidance where deliverables are substantially the same and represent a performance obligation satisfied over time. For performance obligations to provide services that are satisfied over time, we recognize revenue using the POC cost-to-cost method. Contract Estimates:_ Under the POC cost-to-cost method of revenue recognition, a single estimated profit margin is used to recognize profit for each performance obligation over its period of performance. Recognition of profit on a contract requires estimates of the total cost at completion and transaction price and the measurement of progress towards completion. Due to the long-term nature of some of our contracts, developing the estimated total cost at completion and total transaction price often requires judgment. Factors that must be considered in estimating the cost of the work to be completed include the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, subcontractor performance and the risk and impact of delayed performance. Factors that must be considered in estimating the total transaction price include contractual cost as well as our historical experience and our expectation for performance on the contract. At the outset of each contract, we gauge its complexity and perceived risks and establish an estimated total cost at completion in line with these expectations. After establishing the estimated total cost at completion, we follow a standard Estimate at Completion (“EAC”) process in which we review the progress and performance on our ongoing contracts at least quarterly and, in many cases, more frequently. If we successfully retire risks associated with the technical, schedule and cost aspects of a contract, we may lower our estimated total cost at completion commensurate with the retirement of these risks. Conversely, if we are not successful in retiring these risks, we may increase our estimated total cost at completion. Additionally, as the contract progresses, our estimates of total transaction price may increase or decrease if, for example, we receive award fees that are higher or lower than expected. When adjustments in estimated total costs at completion or in estimated total transaction price are determined, the related impact on operating income is recognized using the cumulative catch-up method, which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of such adjustments for all prior periods.

364,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,182,NOTE 15: SUBSEQUENT EVENTS,182.19,Fair Value Measurements—Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to,182.19.1,,"transfer a liability in the principal market (or most advantageous market, in the absence of a principal market) for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Entities are required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value, and to utilize a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows: - Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. - Level 2—Observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable or are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means. - Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities, and reflect our own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed using the best information available in the circumstances.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

Costs to fulfill a contract include costs directly related to a contract or specific anticipated contract (for example, mobilization, set-up and certain design costs) that generate or enhance our ability to satisfy our performance obligations under these contracts. These costs are capitalized to the extent they are expected to be recovered from the associated contract. Capitalized costs to obtain or fulfill a contract are amortized to expense over the expected period of benefit for contracts with terms greater than one year on a systematic basis that is consistent with the pattern of transfer of the associated goods and services to the customer. As a practical expedient, capitalized costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a term of one year or less are expensed as incurred.

We initially record goodwill for the amount the consideration transferred exceeds the acquisition-date fair value of net identifiable assets acquired. We test goodwill for impairment at a level within the Business referred to as the reporting unit. We test our goodwill for impairment annually as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter, or under certain circumstances, more frequently, such as when events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment. Such events or circumstances may include a significant deterioration in overall economic conditions, changes in the business climate of our industry, a decline in our market capitalization, operating performance indicators, competition, reorganizations of our business or the disposal of all or a portion of a reporting unit. To test goodwill for impairment, we may perform both qualitative and quantitative assessments. If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the probability that goodwill is impaired. If we determine it is more likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we measure any loss from an impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired, and an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

As a practical expedient, leases with a term of twelve months or less (including reasonably expected extension periods) are expensed as incurred. We did not have any finance leases at April 2, 2021 and January 1, 2021. Operating lease assets are included in the “Operating lease right-of-use assets” line item in our Combined Balance Sheet. Operating lease liabilities for obligations due within twelve months are included in the “Other accrued items” line item in our Combined Balance Sheet. Operating lease liabilities for obligations due longer than twelve months are included in the “Operating lease liabilities” line item in our Combined Balance Sheet. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future lease payments. Lease payments include base rent. Our lease payments also include non-lease components such as real estate taxes and common-area maintenance costs. As a practical expedient, we account for lease and non-lease components as a single component. The present value of future lease payments is determined using our incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement over the expected lease term. We use our incremental borrowing rate because our leases do not provide an implicit lease rate. The expected lease term represents the number of years we expect to lease the property, including options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option. Operating lease expense is recognized as an operating cost on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term in our Combined Statement of Income.",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

364,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,182,NOTE 15: SUBSEQUENT EVENTS,182.31,Income Taxes—The Business’ income tax provision was prepared following the separate return method. The,182.31.1,,"separate return method applies ASC 740 to the stand-alone financial statements of each member of the combined group as if the group members were a separate taxpayer. The calculation of our income taxes on a separate return basis requires a considerable amount of judgment and use of both estimates and allocations. As a result, actual transactions included in the consolidated financial statements of L3Harris may not be included in the separate Combined Financial Statements of the Business. Similarly, the tax treatment of certain items reflected in the Combined Financial Statements of the Business may not be reflected in the consolidated financial statements and tax returns of L3Harris. Therefore, such items as net operating losses, credit carry-forwards and valuation allowances may exist in the stand-alone financial statements that may or may not exist in L3Harris’ consolidated financial statements. The Business provides for income taxes using the liability method. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect tax carryforwards and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes, as determined under enacted tax laws and rates. The effect of changes in tax laws or rates is accounted for in the period of enactment. Valuation allowances for deferred tax assets are provided when it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized, considering, when appropriate, tax planning strategies. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,511

Factors that affect the estimated cost for warranties include the terms of the contract, the type and complexity of the delivered product, number of installed units, historical experience and management’s assumptions regarding anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim. Our standard warranties start from the shipment, delivery or customer acceptance date and typically range from one to two years. Because our products are manufactured, in many cases, to customer specifications and their acceptance is based on meeting those specifications, we historically have experienced minimal warranty costs. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units, historical experience, anticipated delays in delivery of products to end customers, in-country support for international sales and our assumptions regarding anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim.

Our contracts are often subsequently modified to include changes in specifications, requirements or price that may create new or change existing enforceable rights and obligations. We do not account for contract modifications (including unexercised options) or follow-on contracts until they meet the requirements noted above to account for a contract. At the inception of each contract, we evaluate the promised goods and services to determine whether the contract should be accounted for as having one or more performance obligations. A performance obligation is a promise to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer and represents the unit of accounting for revenue recognition. A substantial majority of our revenue is derived from long-term development and production contracts involving the design, development, manufacture or modification of engines and/or transmissions for military combat vehicles and spare parts according to customer’s specifications. Due to the highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the engine and transmission systems which often result in the delivery of multiple units, we account for these contracts as one performance obligation.

Claimed amounts against us may be substantial, but may not bear any reasonable relationship to the merits of the claim or the extent of any real risk of court or arbitral awards. We record accruals for losses related to those matters against us that we consider to be probable and that can be reasonably estimated. Gain contingencies, if any, are recognized when they are realized and legal costs generally are expensed when incurred. At April 2, 2021, our accrual for the potential resolution of lawsuits, claims or proceedings that we consider probable of being decided unfavorably to us was not material. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these matters with certainty, it is reasonably possible that some lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be disposed of or decided unfavorably to us and in excess of the amounts currently accrued. Based on available information, in the opinion of management, settlements, arbitration awards and final judgments, if any, which are considered probable of being rendered against us in litigation or arbitration in existence at April 2, 2021 are reserved against or would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,511
